No ice.
Oh, my God.
Forever.
Forever and ever.
Big Macs.
After all these hours there's no falloff in activity, no drop in his blood pressure.
All day yesterday, he got uglier and uglier.
Last night, he turned on Betty.
He tore her apart and then he ate her.
Okay, let's get the old video equipment in here.
I want to record every move he makes.
Forever and ever.
We don't know exactly what it is, but what it amounts to is a premature degeneration comparable to that of aging.
What we call the internal clock begins to speed up at about the age of five.
- Tragic.
I won't use that magic word "immortality" but longevity is something that's got to be...
- What have you been doing?
- None of your business.
We have a woman who's into her 90s she only sleeps about two or three hours a night and believe me, she has far more energy and enthusiasm than any of us.
Forgive me.
- Poor darling.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Nothing, but I would like to talk to you.
What exactly is your position here?
I'm a blood analyst.
Have you found there's a relation between blood type and aging?
But my suspicion would be what kind of blood you have affects how much you sleep, how deeply and how you sleep affects how you age.
- Straight ahead.
- We can guess...
...hypothesize that certain blood disorders and tissue deficiencies result in a rapid degeneration similar to the symptoms of accelerated aging.
We've even had results here with monkeys in speeding up the clock but we are a long way from turning it back.
We can't quite promise you everlasting life.
- You all right?
- My hair comes out in my hand.
I've been reading this book.
Why are these books always so badly written, I wonder?
I've been there.
How long is it going to take?
How long did the others take?
- I don't know.
- You must remember, Miriam.
I know it's a long time but it's not the kind of thing that you forget.
- Lollia, how long did she take?
- A week.
A few days.
And the one before that?
I live with your suffering again and again.
I had hoped that this time was just, somehow, some miracle.
I've never stopped hoping that.
Come here.
Who's to keep you company when I'm gone?
I'm sure you have thought about that.
What am I going to do?
I've been reading your book.
It says somewhere that age is a disease, a disease that can be cured.
- They're waiting.
- How old?
- I don't know.
- These are liver spots, aren't they?
- I didn't have them yesterday.
Yesterday, I was 30 years old.
- That's remarkable.
- I'm a young man.
Do you understand?
I'm a young man.
I want you to wait for me and I'll be back in 15 minutes, and then we'll do some tests, okay?
Why don't you have a seat, Mr. Blaylock, and I'll be with you as soon as I can.
Fifteen minutes.
I'll try.
You must think that I'm quite crazy.
- Of course.
Just let him sit there for a while, and he'll probably get tired and leave.
Hi, how are you?
You're looking fine.
Sir, smoking is not permitted.
The effective age at this point: 55.
- And what's that in human terms?
- Equivalent to around 92.
Decay starts accelerating here.
He's aging at a rate of approximately five years per minute.
What was the result of that test then, Charlie?
His blood cells gradually lost their ability to obtain oxygen.
The effective age now: 85.
Human equivalent: 129.
And life signs terminate right here.
Now watch this.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
It is your job.
Just show them the tapes.
Okay, so I don't understand exactly how it works but I'm going to find out, if it kills me.
- You let me down.
You made me sit here for over two hours.
- Mr. Blaylock, wait, please.
Mr. Blaylock, please come into my office...
Why don't you take a seat in the patients' lounge?
You can't leave.
You stupid old fuck!
- What do you want?
There's nobody here.
I do music with the Blaylocks every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- It's Tuesday.
Maybe I could leave a note.
Are you a friend of theirs?
You're the first friend of theirs I ever met.
They don't entertain a great deal.
You've got the same eyes.
Really?
- Play something.
Miriam tells me you have great promise.
Miriam said that?
I used to play a little myself when I was a young man.
I've got this Lalo trio I've been working on.
Probably going to make a fool of myself, but you asked for it.
- C minor.
- That's right.
- A little saccharine.
- That's what John says.
You know, John speaks before he thinks.
You don't like John?
I didn't say that.
He's just hard to figure out, that's all.
Please play the Lalo for me even if it is a little saccharine.
- Are you sure you're not John's father?
Forgive me.
I got caught in the rain.
You said forever.
Every day.
Never growing old.
Do you remember?
Stop it.
Forever young.
Stop it.
Then kill me.
What have you done?
Kill me.
I can't.
Kill me, Miriam.
Release me.
You don't understand.
Please, Miriam.
There is no release, my darling.
No rest.
No letting go.
Humankind die one way, we another.
In the earth, in the rotting wood in the eternal darkness we will see and hear and feel.
Lollia this is John.
Comfort him.
All of you, all my loves be kind to him tonight.
Who is it?
I know.
Mr. Blaylock came to see me at the hospital yesterday and I'm afraid we had a terrible misunderstanding.
My husband is not here.
When will he be back?
I mean, we get so many cranks at the hospital, you know.
Anyway, I feel terrible about it.
I'm very sorry, and I'd like the chance to talk to him and see if there's something that I couldn't do.
Maybe in a day or two when I know a little more when we know each other better.
Lt. Allegrezza.
I don't usually get a smile on that.
- It means "good cheer."
Alice Cavender didn't come home last night and she didn't show up at school today.
You don't have any idea where she might be, do you, Mrs. Blaylock?
No, I'm afraid not.
She didn't say anything about any problems at home or with any boyfriends or anything like that, did she?
Like I say, nine times out of ten there's nothing to worry about with things like this.
Not exactly.
Are you getting the phone?
It didn't ring.
Barbara, did you just buzz me?
I don't know why I'm here.
Come in.
I don't know how much he told you about himself, about us.
Very little.
That is perhaps for the best.
I think you'll like this one.
This is real, isn't it?
You've got so many beautiful things.
Most of it comes from my family.
I love this piece.
It's one of my favorites, too.
She looks like you.
Really?
I mean, you know kind of like you.
I'm sure we could talk for hours, you and I, but I suppose you're very busy.
That's great.
Plenty of time for your friends and lots of lunches and dinners and cocktail parties at the Museum of Modern Art?
How do you spend your time?
I like your pendant.
It's Egyptian.
You know it was the symbol of everlasting life?
What's that piece you're playing?
It's Lakmé by Delibes.
Lakmé is a Brahmin princess in India.
- She has a slave named Mallika.
In a magical garden, they sing how they follow the stream to its source gliding over the water.
Is it a love song?
I told you, it was sung by two women.
- Sounds like a love song.
- Then I suppose that's what it is.
Are you making a pass at me, Mrs. Blaylock?
Not that I'm aware of, Sarah.
You ordered it rare.
- I know.
- So what's the problem?
Nothing.
And you sent back the clams.
I'm just not very hungry.
I thought I wanted it.
The woman that I went to see this afternoon.
You just met her and she gives you a present?
She's that kind of a woman.
She's European.
Did you have something you wanted to tell me?
About what the hell is wrong with you.
I mean, what happened today?
We had some sherry in these fancy little glasses and we talked.
- You hate sherry.
- I know.
- It gives you a headache.
- I know.
Seems like three-and-a-half hours is a hell of a long time to have a conversation with a stranger.
Now you're telling me how long my conversations are supposed to be?
- What's wrong with you?
- What the hell is wrong with you?
I told you, this woman's husband is rotting away in some Swiss clinic somewhere.
She's lonely and she doesn't have a friend in the world.
You know what I think?
I mean, do you want to know what I think?
I'm sure you're going to tell me anyway.
I think you should see a doctor.
I am a doctor.
And so am I.
So, Charlie, what is it?
It's as if two entirely different strains of blood were not only present but fighting it out for dominance.
I need a cigarette.
The foreign strain, were you able to isolate it?
The spooky part is it isn't human blood.
It's not human.
- What species?
Explain this to me.
You're telling us that Sarah has some weird blood fouling up her veins?
- What's that?
- I don't know.
Charlie, you said that there's a fight between the two strains for dominance.
Who's winning, Charlie?
At this moment, my colleagues think I'm in the office of a leading blood specialist, but I decided instead to come here.
- What have you done to me?
There's some alien strain consuming my blood.
You're frightened.
You're damn right I'm frightened.
I know it's a bruise.
- Everlasting life.
Look, I am tired of all your bullshit!
Enough!
I made a simple incision.
I drew your blood, and then you took mine.
You're crazy.
You belong to me.
We belong to each other.
I'm getting out of here.
You'll be back.
When the hunger hurts so much you've lost reason then you'll have to feed, and then you'll need me to show you how.
You're crazy.
What do you mean he's gone home?
Lady, how about it?
Crazy fucking junkie.
If you care to leave a message, kindly wait for the tone.
I still haven't heard from her.
Help yourself to a drink.
- It's Tom Haver.
I'm sorry to disturb you so late but she didn't come home tonight, and I'm worried.
I just spoke to a doctor that she had an appointment with this afternoon... and she never showed.
I know that she was here yesterday, and I just thought maybe...
Yes, come in.
She's upstairs?
Dr. Haver, she's not well.
Where upstairs?
On the second floor, in the bedroom.
What is this?
Wait a minute.
Go!
- What are you talking about?
It's not nearly as difficult as you imagined, is it?
You will sleep six hours in every 24 you will feed one day in seven and from this moment, you will never grow old.
Not a minute.
You'll be young forever.
You're part of me now, and I cannot let you go.
We're damned to live forever with no release, no end.
After a little while, you will forget what you were and you will begin to love me as I love you.
Forever.
Forever and ever.
I can't.
John?
Lt. Allegrezza to see Mrs. Blaylock, please.
- The sale?
- Yes.
I have some clients upstairs looking the place over and it all happened very suddenly.
My understanding is that the owners are deceased and whatever profits are leftover are going to some kind of research center or clinic in town.
Would you mind very much?
Let's go over this shit again.
McKee and Cline, you're outside in case we get some jump-outs...
- Foley.
- Excuse me a sec.
Where in the hell is SWAT?
I wouldn't raid a church bingo game without SWAT.
Just observe how I don't have to use SWAT, and trust me.
Everybody's ready?
Nobody need to take a nervous piss?
Let's mount up.
What are you doing?
Bobby, they're here.
Any trouble with the hijack?
- Right where you said.
- Piece of cake.
Nobody got hurt, boss.
- Ain't yours till we see money.
I just want to look in the back.
- Where's our money?
- Pay him.
You think we should have used SWAT?
- Kill him.
Go, go, go!
Go!
They got fucking machineguns.
- You said they had no guns!
- They must have changed their view.
Get the 12-gauge.
We should've called SWAT.
What the...?
Daniel, come on!
Axel, you on a coffee break?
Go get that son of a bitch.
We got a tail.
Wax that clown.
God damn it!
Help me, man.
Get the fuck out of here, all right?
I'm a police officer chasing a killer who's getting away now.
We know.
What's happened is you're in the middle of a federal investigation.
It's very important he not be apprehended at this time.
We want to know where he's going and who he's selling it to.
- It's drugs?
- We're not DEA.
We appreciate your co-operation on this.
I checked with Washington, Fulbright's kosher.
He's working on something classified.
What you got?
Only one was strapped, he was still holstered.
The bodies of the shooters had 30,000 cash.
- High-price heat.
- San Diego drivers' licenses.
San Diego PD's sheet says enforcers for hire for Tijuana drug dealers.
It's about drugs?
An attaché case had a towel from the Wonder World Hotel, California.
Doctor said it was lifted while in an amusement park.
- Excuse me.
- Wonder World.
I understand that you were with him at the end.
Actually, his last words were,
Those were his last words.
- That sounds like my Douglas.
- It sounds like a good idea, too.
Hello, I'm looking for Billy Rosewood.
Welcome to Beverly Hills Police.
If you have homeless people on your lawn, press 15.
If you need the riot rumour hotline, press 17.
Which button for Billy Rosewood?
Come in.
It's open.
- Axel Foley!
- Billy, how you doing?
- I don't believe it.
You got a refrigerator in your office?
J Edgar Hoover didn't have a refrigerator.
Just some hair curlers or something.
- Did they promote you to captain?
Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command.
- Geography?
- LA is a vast metropolis with social and economic imbalances spread over an enormous distance.
- The green line?
- Green lines of jurisdiction.
Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Santa Monica.
Officers respect these green lines, but the criminal doesn't.
Whenever a criminal crosses green lines, the DDO-JSIOC goes to work.
Very impressive, Billy.
I control the green lines, and Axel... whoever controls the green lines controls Southern California.
You wanted to see me, Billy?
The sheriff's department nabbed two guys pulling a stall-and-hook.
It's the same MO as those jobs on Melrose.
I'll run out there and talk to them.
- Taggart talked about you.
Taggart's retired to Phoenix.
Spends his days lost in the woods looking for his golf balls.
That's a dream I'm not too far from myself.
- Wonder World?
- Plates?
- Ellis DeWald, head of security.
Biggest private security force in America.
You'll love Wonder World, it's a great place.
Which one of those green lines is Wonder World behind?
Yes, I'd like to talk to a park executive, a Mr. Ellis DeWald.
- Do you have an appointment?
Maybe they haven't called yet.
A Detective Flint was supposed to call and get me squared away.
If you don't have an appointment you'll need a ticket.
- How much is a ticket?
All I wanna do is talk to the director of security.
Excuse me, sir, would you step out of line?
- What line?
- Just step over here, please, sir.
Thank you.
- Is there a problem, sir?
- $35, that's the problem.
If the admission seems high, try Fantasy Park.
You might find their ticket price to your liking.
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm supposed to.
Supposed to is not having, is it, sir?
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uncle Dave.
What's going on?
"Alien Attack"?
Can I help you?
I was just curious what Alien Attack is.
Watch.
Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation.
Excuse me, but what are you doing in here?
- What should we do?
Excuse me.
- That's not fair.
- Hear how dry it sounds?
- Sorry.
- Hi, Mom!
- Up here!
- Bring that man down.
- I can't until it goes all...
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!
Code red on The Spider.
Help!
Shit!
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK, just don't let go.
All units near Wonder World, proceed to assist in emergency rescue.
- We are?
- We're gonna try.
Come up and hold on to my neck.
Not too tight!
Give me your hand.
Come on.
Hang on tight!
Our head of security confirmed your identity with the Detroit police.
But neither they nor I... ..understand what you're doing at Wonder World.
I'm investigating a crime.
Miss Perkins is here with the surveillance tapes.
Send her right in.
This starts in The Spider maintenance tunnel.
There I am, coming down the tunnel.
- What is that?
- I don't see any gunmen, Mr. Foley.
- So who was I shooting at?
They don't show that.
That would be very impressive, if you didn't cause the malfunction.
- Mr. DeWald.
- Send him in.
Mr. Foley, Mr. DeWald.
That's the fucking guy I'm looking for!
What's going on here?
He shot a Detroit police officer last weekend!
You were at your beach...
- Miss Bruce, call the police.
- They just walked in.
- Ellis DeWald?
We really appreciate this, Ellis.
Your friend is lucky Mr. Sanderson doesn't want any publicity.
You just keep him and his delusions out of my face and out of my park.
Bring your money, sucker.
Here we go.
Thank you.
And the usual for you, Billy.
- Thanks a lot.
- Isn't it possible you're mistaken?
That Ellis DeWald just resembles Todd's killer?
He's the head of the largest private police department in California.
He's getting an award from the Association of Security Agencies.
It's understandable that you're distraught and looking for justice, not to mention revenge.
But isn't it just possible that you want it so much that you saw your killer in a man who bore a slight resemblance?
We run into this all the time in police work.
- Where's he getting that award?
Flint, your friend DeWald is foul.
- Pick me up at the Sunset Motel.
Freeze, motherfucker!
- Detective Foley?
- You're Uncle Dave!
- Thank you.
- I was such a fan of yours.
- Thank you, son.
- Uncle Dave...
- There's something going on?
- I have no doubts.
Roger Fry designed the park, from the landscaping to the concession stands.
- What do you mean, disappeared?
- Show him the note.
I received this interoffice the day Roger disappeared.
What was he doing the day he disappeared?
He was probably doing one of his usual inspections.
- This guy designed the whole park?
- Yes.
- And he knew the place cold?
So what are you thinking?
He must've found something someone didn't want him to find.
At Wonder World?
What on earth could that be?
It's a place of childhood innocence and fun.
And life and death.
- Did he do the Oki-Doki Shuffle?
Outstanding.
- William Rosewood, DDO-JSIOC.
- I beg your pardon?
What you gonna do with this shit?
- "Surge."
- Serge.
You put a good package together.
- You remember Billy Rosewood.
- Billy, I remember you.
I made you an espresso at the art gallery with a lemon twist?
It was the last one I ever made.
And you got healthy gums.
- Do you do colonics?
- Excuse me?
- It's my new favourite!
- You dig colonics?
- What happened to your art gallery?
- It is completely bankrupt, in the toilet.
Why?
Because we had an owner who was obstinate and stupid and ignorant.
- You shot him, remember?
We are doing weapons and protective devices and products for survival in the helter-skelter world of today.
Why should you look ugly if you're just trying to survive?
Is look like a key chain, but it's so much more.
Also I never see him in pants that fit.
So you say - a little bit of deception -
"l want to separate my house and car keys.
"I'll just push this button, OK?" And he says, "OK."
And then you push this button, and out it comes from the mechanism, the brightest, blinding light ever that you seeing.
That's cool.
Billy, I want to give you one for a present.
Thank you.
And, Ackwell, I want to give you one because I worry about you.
- I want you to be safe.
- Thanks.
Now I'll show you something that is going to blow your rocks off.
It's absolutely orgasmic and my most thing that I'm proud of.
It's the most up-to-date, the ultimate survival tool for today.
A new generation of luxury personal weaponry, the Annihilator 2000 is America's premier survival, home and travel security unit.
The Annihilator 2000 is a high-performance weapon that meets the demands of upper income urban survivalists.
The Annihilator 2000 has the conveniences of a cellphone, fax and microwave oven.
Night-vision goggles, microprocessor, verbal alarm systems, compact disc player, digital radio, video camera and playback functions are just a few features of the extraordinary Annihilator 2000.
You think those are real?
Stopping power is a matter of convenience.
She's working on reducing my body fat, but it's difficult because I keep sneaking goat cheese.
The Annihilator 2000 is constructed of aluminium alloy combined with polymer technology, totally resistant to corrosion.
A new generation in luxury personal weaponry, the Annihilator 2000 is America's premier survival, home and travel security unit.
Who's gonna buy that shit?
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Sly bought 14.
Zsa Zsa Gabor has one...
"Surge" sounds like a detergent.
What are you gonna do?
To keep a park like Wonder World a safe, wholesome, family environment in difficult times like these is an enormous challenge.
But my friend Ellis DeWald has done just that.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mike.
Thank you very much.
You know, a lot of nice things happen when you work at a nice place like Wonder World, especially when your bosses are people like Orrin Sanderson and Uncle Dave Thornton.
Ellis DeWald, ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen, I've travelled from Detroit to be with this man tonight, to honour this man tonight.
I can feel his body tingling!
But, ladies and gentlemen, there's not a night that goes by that I don't think about what I owe Ellis DeWald.
And there's not a night that passes that I don't think about what the people of Detroit owe Ellis DeWald.
That's beautiful...
"With gratitude for community service."
And I'm going to do the community a service because I'm going to pay back Ellis DeWald everything we owe him with interest!
Just make your phone call and get us out of here.
Don't fuck with me right now.
Incidentally, we found that truck you wanted.
- Where?
- By the Santa Monica pier.
In the meantime, don't take any showers.
I really liked that office.
- That was quick.
Not him, just you.
Come in.
Thank you, officer.
I ran a check on you, Foley.
You're a hell of a detective, but something of a maverick.
Ticket to Detroit, first class, courtesy of the Federal Government.
Also, my card.
Should you have any more thoughts about DeWald, let us handle it.
I give you my word as a gentleman I'll be on that plane.
Truck was spotted by an LAPD traffic officer.
It's a different colour but the same make and model.
Negatory, SWAT, hold for our arrival.
Billy, who were you talking to?
All teams standing ready...
Area secured.
Lab says these are the same fibres as the truck upholstery.
I just had a very unpleasant conversation with my superiors.
- About being busted?
There was some objection to my use of manpower on Operation Truck Siege.
- What is it?
- You got a $50 bill?
- You got a $50 bill?
- When do I get it back?
Man, give me $50!
It's all I got.
This is part of a $50 bill like Billy's with the hidden barcode.
No, the barcode's going up, so it comes off this corner.
Oki-Doki!
- Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.
You're supposed to be nice, no matter what!
You little motherfucker...
You take it already.
Who ate garlic?
When's lunch?
Louis, how's it going?
- Fine, fine.
- Say hi to Irene.
- Will do.
Follow me.
When DeWald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch.
Do any of these tunnels lead to somewhere only DeWald's boys can go?
Show me the Happy Forest.
- How long's it been closed?
- Too long.
I'm talking about the Happy Forest ride?
It wasn't very popular so they're trying some new ideas.
- Thanks.
There you go.
- That would be nice.
- Can you put that in here?
There you go.
- Say hello to Irene.
Everything on schedule?
I had to tweak the image a little bit, but it's under control now.
Foley's up there.
Get him!
Will the DeWald family please come to Tiny Town?
The DeWald family to Tiny Town.
But, honey, the Happy Forest is closed.
OK, I'll meet you at the main gate at 5:00.
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
Could you patch me into his radio?
Fulbright, Foley.
Get me 911.
Why am I not surprised?
This is great.
- I'm on to your operation.
- My operation?
God damn it, Axel, what have you done now?
There are hundreds of children around.
- They don't give Oscars in prison.
- Fuck you!
There's someone here from...
Fulbright, Secret Service.
- I put you on a plane to Detroit.
You wanted to follow the truck back to LA to find his print shop.
- It's right here in Wonder World.
- What is he raving on about?
This place is as high-tech as NASA and Nintendo combined.
My men were pursuing Mr. Foley because he's delusionary and potentially dangerous.
This room, delusionary also?
- I'd better take a look at it.
- Maybe we'd better look at it.
- Is this true?
- 'Fraid so, officer.
'Fraid we've been caught red-handed, right, Ellis?
'Fraid so.
Would you like to see them?
We call them Wonder World dollars.
Redeemable for admission, rides, souvenirs.
It's our big Christmas promotion.
We're giving it away to elementary schools across the country.
You must be in on this.
You supply equipment, he supplies paper, right?
- What's this paper?
- Ordinary rag.
- They switched it.
I am tired of these accusations, officers.
I want this man arrested for public endangerment.
Could I speak with you a moment?
God damn it, we spent a fucking year with our noses up DeWald's ass!
We're this close to locking this up, and you piss all over us!
Our case is blown.
Detective Flint, he's yours.
Let's go, Axel.
Make sure he doesn't get on the plane.
I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage and a pension that won't cut it.
That job at Wonder World is my retirement plan.
We're being followed.
It's the security guards at Wonder World.
They probably want to make sure you get on that plane.
Because of you, my future is in real fucking jeopardy.
- Oh, shit!
- Wait!
It used to belong to Uncle Sam.
I don't think so.
I figured you'd call Uncle Dave here, so we followed him.
I actually was a real cop once so I know how you assholes think, which is to say, slowly.
Very slowly.
So you were carrying the evidence the whole time, Sherlock?
Get him all the way in the car.
Take it.
Give me your weapon.
Throw that gun in the street!
Close the door and get over there!
Don't you die on me, man.
That was Uncle Dave.
- Pressure?
- 90 over 40 and dropping.
I've been shot before, but it's no big deal.
- Where's the coffee machine?
- Down the hall.
This is an all-city alert for a suspect in the Thornton shooting.
Suspect is an African-American male...
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Is there a TV here?
Yes, of course.
Authorities believe that Foley attacked Uncle Dave in retaliation for some personal rejection.
The much-loved Uncle Dave is undergoing surgery at this moment.
According to hospital sources, the prognosis is bleak.
How does a psycho like that live with himself?
They're going to kill whoever knows about Roger Fry's note.
- If you do anything...
- It'll be your fault.
I want you at Wonder World within the hour.
Come to the main gate alone and unarmed.
- And bring the Mint paper.
- Then you let us go?
If you don't show up here in a half-hour, alone, unarmed and with no cops, I kill your friend.
And it wouldn't be the first time, would it?
We have an amateur video of the incident this afternoon involving Uncle Dave's assassin, Axel Foley.
That was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist.
Would you please take special care of my car?
- Yes, sir.
- Shit!
- Ackwell...
Serge, I need a weapon.
- What about this?
- This is the floor model.
People been breathing on it, coughing on it...
Serge, I need a weapon now.
It's Corinthian leather.
I'm sure you can explain, or maybe you can't explain, but you've got to turn yourself in.
- I'm going to Wonder World.
Put your arms out and hold for a pat-down.
Foley just arrived, sir.
- How much do you want run?
- All of it.
- Are you OK?
- Let's have the paper.
When she calls, I'll give you it.
- I don't think so.
- Then we got a stalemate.
How you know I didn't mail it to the Secret Service?
- He's bluffing.
The keys, Foley.
Give me the fucking keys.
- Drop that fucking gun!
- Again?
Drop it!
Axel, what are you doing here?
- It's the coolant safety system.
Protects the mainframe in case of fire.
- How do we get it open?
Hello, police?
Shit!
Mr. DeWald!
There's just the modem line for the computers.
Foley is heading for Alien Attack.
He ran up those stairs.
I need that right away!
Dispatch, this is Flint.
Trace that number that keeps calling me. 555-4085.
It's a computer line at the Wonder World theme park.
Call and tell them their computer's broken.
We tried, but all the voice lines are down.
Must be that Uncle Dave shooting.
- Some fool named Axel Foley.
Where the fuck is he?
All right!
What the hell happened here?
Shit!
Damn it!
Turn that fucking song off!
- Hello, Fulbright.
- You hurt bad?
I found out about another partner that was in on it.
So long, Foley.
You OK?
You guys OK?
I wonder what time the park opens.
He needs medical attention.
- Does this hurt?
- Don't touch it.
I am so happy to introduce to you our new character in Wonder World, named after a man who's most responsible for my being here today.
Axel Fox!
I don't think you've seen the Tunnel of Love ride, have you?
I didn't know y'all had a Tunnel of Love ride in Wonder World.
There will be shortly.
There you are!
How was your day?
Any progress in saving the world?
I'm working on it.
You changed your mind about tonight?
Fortunately, they missed their plane.
Here's to stolen moments.
You look so handsome, I better see if I can catch up.
Nobody home?
I left some Security Council transcripts out, but everybody's gone.
Anything earth-shattering?
No, it's just important enough not to be left out.
You look incredible.
Yeah, but we have to hurry.
I prefer this one.
Right.
Steven, how are you?
That's Steven Taylor and his wife, Emily.
Well, at last!
The beautiful people have arrived.
I didn't expect to see you tonight, with Greenspan and all.
Why's that?
I thought you'd be up to your ass in alligators.
Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
All I need is her phone number.
The temple's hieroglyphics are supplications to the gods of fertility.
I do believe I know his work.
Perhaps we could come along to your studio one day.
You said he wasn't coming.
What are we going to do?
You're a peach.
Lunch tomorrow?
And tomorrow and tomorrow.
I leave you alone for 30 seconds and you elope with a younger man.
Steven, I'd like to introduce you to David Shaw.
David is a painter.
What brings you uptown to our little inbred soirée?
Actually, Emily was kind enough to wrangle me an invite.
Me too.
So tell me about your work David?
A couple small galleries carry me when there's space.
- You studied formally?
Yes.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
Pleasure to see you.
It's the same speech he gave in Geneva 3 months ago, word for word.
Showoff.
- Good morning, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.
Steven, spreads are blowing out.
The way things look in Europe, it could turn into a bloodbath.
- So what are we talking?
- At least 150 basis points.
The Bundesbank will have to tag along.
Your yen and mark positions will get hammered.
So what's our exposure?
Based on my preliminary trend model?
Think Chernobyl.
Greenpoint, next stop.
What you got there?
It's a little surprise.
Come on up.
Here's your fortune.
"You have a deep interest in all that is artistic. "
It's true.
You didn't have to get this for me.
You need a little civilizing.
What do you need?
What do you need?
You know, we could be in Belize this time tomorrow.
Belize.
You ever been there?
You'd think you'd died and went to heaven.
But I already think that.
You look so pretty today.
I thought I might come by and check out your work.
Say about six.
If that flies with you, call me at my office here at 5-4-4- 1-8- 1-7.
I look forward to seeing you.
What are you going to do?
I guess I'll call him.
Be kind of weird if I didn't, wouldn't it?
You're playing with fire, David.
If you're so upset about it, why'd you give him my number?
I didn't.
Mr. Taylor?
Thanks very much.
Drink?
No, I'm okay.
Unless you want another one.
I just had us meet here because my place is hard to find.
Like an illegal loft space?
That's one way to put it.
I feel like I'm knee-deep in bohemian cachet.
Lead on.
- How's Emily?
- She's fine, thank you.
Well, be sure and say "hi. "
I will.
Building's over 100 years old now.
Watch your step.
I can certainly see what Emily was drawn to.
Trashy?
Is that what she said?
Your anger it's very controlled.
You think I'm angry?
The anger in your work.
The color of despair.
Wonder where that comes from.
I don't know.
Inside, I guess.
Inside indeed.
Nowhere to sit but the goddamned bed.
You know, I envy you.
You envy me?
I've got it and you know why.
One of life's legitimately sublime experiences.
It's so utterly complete.
What?
Fucking my wife.
We're in love, sir.
You steal the crown jewel of a man's soul and your only excuse is some candy-ass Hallmark card sentiment?
Even if it was true, that's not good enough!
If what were true?
What the hell are you saying?
I'm saying you did not meet my wife by chance.
I'm saying you didn't study at Berkeley.
I'm saying you learned to paint while doing 3 to 6 in Soledad Prison for relieving a widow in San Francisco of her life savings.
Your second conviction if I'm not mistaken.
Your real name is Winston Lagrange, which I rather like.
Born to pure trailer trash in Barstow, California.
Ward of the courts since the age of ten.
You went from pickpocket to car thief to con man till you found out that you had a way with the softer sex.
No doubt looking for that mother you can barely remember.
A life made up completely of depressing little scams until now.
Where'd you get all that?
But you set your sights too high this time.
She loves me.
She loves David Shaw, your invention.
But you've made a fundamental miscalculation.
Play it out.
Love conquers all.
Given your history, her advisors are going to insist upon a prenup.
You might storm the castle but you ain't getting the keys to the treasure room, ever.
I don't care about that.
The swindler doesn't care about a trust fund that can buy Barstow?
Why don't you cut the shit!
You care, or we would not be having this conversation!
The only thing that stops you from bolting now is bad genes and greed.
Now what?
Choices.
Or?
Or you can cash out.
Cash out?
Half a million dollars.
Tax-free.
Just for walking away from her?
What's 500 grand for?
Killing my wife.
Imagine my embarrassment if they're not the same.
$100,000 now $400,000 after, cash-and-carry.
You're out of your mind.
Not really.
Why?
I appreciate your curiosity, but my agenda doesn't concern you.
I'll go straight to Emily and tell her all this.
That would be my word against yours Winston.
And what if I call the cops?
Have you ever been to Boca Raton, Florida?
When the affair ended he disappeared along with the lady's bearer bonds.
You sure you've never been there?
Not that I recall.
An acquaintance of mine has a photograph of the suspect.
All they need is a name as in, strike three.
You think you got a box big enough to hold $100,000 in cash?
I assume you know where I live.
Talk to me.
I will if you shut up for one second.
I'm waiting.
I didn't tell you because you adore Steven.
You cried at our wedding, for God's sake.
- I cry at every wedding.
- No, you don't.
But you have no idea who he is.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
What makes you think he doesn't know?
Because there's no way.
And he knows about your family?
What do you mean?
What do you think I mean?
We don't talk about that kind of stuff.
In six months, you never mentioned money?
Believe me, okay?
David has absolutely no interest in anything other than painting and me.
Is that why you're not wearing your wedding ring?
Oh, my God!
What?
I left it at David's.
Working late?
No, I was having a drink with Raquel.
And how is the Castilian femme fatale?
By the way, I saw your friend David this evening.
Really?
He honored me with a visit at his industrial hideaway.
You're kidding.
And where's that?
Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
How'd you get his number?
I called some of those obscure galleries you prowl dropped your name.
You're right.
He's very talented.
Did you buy anything?
I made him an offer.
And?
And he's chewing on it.
Good morning.
I put it away before he got here.
Thank God!
What did you guys talk about?
He wasn't here that long, so just the work.
He didn't have a clue.
He said that he made you an offer.
Matter of fact, he did.
What piece?
It's one you haven't seen.
I thought I'd seen all of them.
Well, almost.
Listen, turns out I got to take a rain check on lunch today.
Some people want to see my sketches and it'd be a good commission.
You sound funny.
Do I?
I guess it's called being broke, sweetheart.
Tomorrow, then.
Reservation for two.
Quiet table, in back.
Very quiet.
You know I love you.
I know.
People with money always go for the same things.
And what are those?
Anything, everything, as long as it's recognizable.
Everything you see here, it's mine.
Why don't you drop that there and come here.
That's nice.
There was a robbery in the building last year.
Probable means of entrance was this driveway gate.
That granite facade creates a blind spot on the surveillance cameras.
It was never corrected, for aesthetic reasons.
How do you know that?
I'm on the board.
You enter as I leave at 8 p.m.
I won't pull out of the driveway till it's clear.
The gate takes 5 seconds to close.
The key to the front door also works here for the service entrance.
I'm going to take the key from Emily's purse before I leave and I'll put it in this and hide it here, right behind the pipe.
- Where're you going to be?
- At my regular card game.
Why don't you leave me your key?
In any case, she won't be around to explain.
Why not make a copy of the key?
It's two loose ends, the key and the locksmith.
You'll be in the stairwell at 9:30.
By that time, Emily will be taking her bath.
Because that's what she does on nights that I play cards.
Why not do it in the tub?
Because that'll look like cold-blooded murder.
It has to appear that she surprised the intruder.
All right?
This is a separate telephone line.
Exactly 10 p.m., I will call here.
Emily will answer the phone.
You will enter.
A tragic confrontation will ensue.
It should appear to be stupid and spur-of-the-moment.
I've always thought "bludgeon" has a spur-of-the-moment sound.
Maybe you could use one of these.
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.
Put the key back under the pipe, then leave the way you came in.
And what happens if the plan goes to hell?
It won't.
So when is this card game of yours?
No fucking way!
A man with your résumé should come up with an alibi in no time.
100 thousand.
A man with my résumé should take the money and run.
Bet you 400 thousand more you don't.
Try surprise.
I had a hole in my schedule and I thought lunch with my beautiful wife would be indicated.
But I guess you have other plans.
- What makes you say that?
- You seem in such a hurry.
It's just errands.
Like shopping for a new wedding ring.
What does that mean?
Wouldn't you regret not having one last lunch with your husband?
Of course.
All right, we'll go out...
David?
He was waiting for me to take me to lunch.
There was nothing I could do.
Hi, I'm here.
I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
No, he doesn't.
Don't let your mind get away from you.
I cannot live like this anymore.
Tell him what, exactly?
Tell him everything, tonight.
Honey, don't panic.
Everything's prepared for you.
Give my best to Mrs. Taylor.
So how was the rest of your day?
Fairly brutal.
I'm sorry to hear about that.
I don't want you to go tonight.
What's wrong?
I'd like to talk to you.
You scared me.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I'll call you later.
I won't, but you might want to reconsider.
Why is that?
I had Janice make one of her legendary roasts.
Really?
Thought we'd eat before the game.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
$1,000 to you, George.
Fold.
Last one, gentlemen.
I'm out.
Must be morning in Hong Kong.
There's my cards.
Let's have a better hand this time.
I'm in.
Different winner this time, though, guys.
Oh, my God!
- What happened?
- Mrs. Taylor, we have your location.
He's in the kitchen.
Please stay on the line.
- Mr. Taylor?
You didn't hear any strange sounds prior to your entering the kitchen?
No, just the phone call.
But before that, nothing unusual?
- How you guys doing?
- We're pretty set here.
I want you to dust the elevator cage and the banister.
Mo, be out of here in 15, 20 minutes.
Maybe.
I noticed what I assume to be your footprints in the blood around the deceased.
May I ask what you were doing?
Making sure he was dead.
Was he?
Appeared to be, yes.
Take his pulse?
You see right there?
Did you lean over him for something?
I tried to determine whether he was breathing.
Something wrong?
Aside from a dead man lying in my kitchen?
For a moment, I thought you knew the man.
I never forget a face.
Anything else?
No.
Your wife must come down to give a statement.
When?
As soon as she's ready.
Mr. Taylor are you aware of anyone who might wish your wife harm?
My wife has no enemies.
I know, baby, I know.
It's okay.
You're going to be all right.
What do you think?
I believe her.
What about him?
I couldn't say.
You know, Mo rich people are different from you and me.
How?
They got a fuck of a lot more money, for one thing.
Very good, Bobby.
Hey, Mo, you going to turn it up, or what?
I like it like this.
You had said before that they did not speak.
She's been through enough tonight.
We're almost through, Mrs. Taylor.
There's just a few more things I'd like to ask.
Remember what time you got home, Mr. Taylor?
You'll love this.
We've I.D.'d the man who broke into your home.
May I?
Sure.
This man is a career criminal.
You couldn't dream up a better defense for justifiable homicide.
How old is your boy?
One month.
Is he ill?
Colic.
May God watch over your son and protect him.
And you as well.
I'm glad we cleared that up.
I'm going to ask you not to leave the city.
If you think of anything else, give me a ring.
I don't know what else there is to think of.
Probably nothing.
May you go in safety.
I'm just down the hall, baby.
Here you go.
By tomorrow, this will all seem like a bad dream.
And what if there were no tomorrow?
You know better than that.
Sleep well.
Sandra, I don't know.
I've gone over it a thousand times myself.
The world's gone crazy.
It's me.
I just wanted to tell you I'm okay.
I'm not in the city, but I'll call as soon as I can.
I love you.
I don't want her to be rushed.
No, of course not.
I don't want her to be rushed either.
I'm going to check on our patient.
Who was he?
Somebody I met at Berkeley.
Can he be connected to you?
Not anymore.
You got any idea who you're fucking with?
You hired me to kill your wife because you couldn't do the wet work yourself.
Well, neither could I.
So how do you know he didn't talk to someone?
Ron was a good man.
Not quite good enough.
So what's plan B?
It's a little coincidental if there's another attempt on her life.
Gee, you think?
So we wait.
For what?
Thank you, Charles.
Steven called while you were asleep.
I'm not going home.
I'm going to move in with Raquel for a while.
Em, what's going on?
I'm leaving Steven.
They've started liquidating your long positions to cover.
Which ones?
DMG and Barclays.
Why didn't anybody tell me?
I said no calls!
What happened to yours?
Did my husband change the locks?
No, not that I know of.
Emily, it's me.
I didn't hear you come in.
You left the front door wide open.
Don't.
I'm your husband.
Raquel's waiting for me downstairs.
Okay, there are fresh towels in the bathroom and you can have anything you want in the fridge including your favorite yogurt.
Let me ask you a question.
What do you think Steven would do if he knew about David?
Screwing around is the second oldest reason to kill somebody.
Money, honey.
But Steven's rich and with your money, you must've had a prenup.
Tell me you had a prenup.
So if you die, he gets, like a hundred million bucks?
Something like that.
We'll sure miss you around here.
Come.
Come and see me on your way out.
Take all the time you need.
Mrs. Taylor passing this kind of information, even to a spouse is unethical.
I understand.
Your husband has been buying U.S. and foreign bonds on margin and using those securities as collateral.
That's illegal.
In fact, his company's been under investigation for almost a year.
Some months ago U.S. interest rates started moving against him.
He should've gotten some horrific margin calls but the banks he's in bed with have hidden the losses hoping that things will turn around.
Sooner or later those margin calls will come.
And when they do, your husband will be wiped out.
Yep, where's the subpoena?
But I can't get the records without it.
I've waited two days.
Just get back to me.
- Detective.
- Please sit down.
To what do I owe the pleasure, Mrs. Taylor?
I have some information about my husband.
Concerning?
It seems he's in serious financial trouble and he was hiding it from me.
I know what you're worth, Mrs. Taylor and that kind of money is always a motive.
Do you mean he's already a suspect?
Was.
It lasted from five minutes before ten to nine minutes after.
That has to be one of the cleaner alibis I've come across.
I took your case apart a thousand times then I put it back together again.
There was always one piece left like a screw that didn't fit.
The dead man had a wallet, cash and change, driver's license membership card to a video store, but not a single key.
Not even to his apartment.
By tomorrow, neither of us will have any balls left.
You drop 50 million in a day.
You know how fast 50 becomes 500?
We're sitting at ground zero.
I said, not now!
I'm sorry, but I have a caller who says this is an emergency.
He says it concerns Emily.
- Who is it?
- He won't identify himself.
Who is this?
A tragic confrontation will ensue.
It should appear to be stupid and spur-of-the-moment.
I've always thought that "bludgeon" has a spur-of-the-moment sound.
Maybe you could use one of these.
Meet me at the diner at the corner of Maiden and South.
Right now.
Must be hard for you.
Mr. Taylor.
You didn't get those fancy shoes dirty walking over here, did you?
What do you want?
The rest of my money.
You didn't fulfill your end of the bargain, did you?
So?
So what do I get?
You get this superfine thing.
"Legitimately sublime. "
What exactly is this superfine thing?
It's called time outside of prison, old partner.
You can't beat it with a stick.
Exactly how much time does $400,000 buy me?
Whatever the market will bear.
It'll take me a few days.
You got four hours.
That's impossible and you know it.
Where?
My place.
You don't show up with the cash I'll do a mailing of Steven's greatest hits.
I understand.
Make fucking sure you do.
What are you doing here?
That's not happiness to see me, is it?
Try surprise.
The key to the dead man's apartment was on my key chain.
Me.
Why?
To protect you.
From what?
Your lover.
Unless somebody else sent these pictures.
Amazing how you know people are in love, even across the street.
He called me here two months ago bragged about how you'd fallen for him.
I've shelled out over $100,000 already but he wants a lot more.
For what?
For breaking it off.
I don't believe you.
Did he mention Belize?
That's where he took all the other ones.
This guy was quite an aphrodisiac for lonely women of means.
He learned to paint in prison not at Berkeley.
I have done everything in my power to protect you from this career criminal that you've let crawl into our bed.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was sure you were in love with him.
Are you?
I thought that I was.
I can only imagine what I've put you through.
Is this why your business is in trouble?
Trouble?
The banks, margin calls.
How did you know...?
It hasn't helped, no.
- But it's true, isn't it?
There's a goddamn sea of it out there.
But there's only one of you.
But why did you put his key on my key chain?
David threatened violence from the very beginning.
When I saw the body, I was sure it was him.
No doors had been forced open, so I assumed that he had your key.
Are you sure you used your key?
If memory serves me the door was wide open.
I saw you walk in.
Maybe.
Yes.
I searched his pockets, I found what I thought was your key I grabbed a screwdriver, jimmied the door.
I put it in his pocket, took what I thought was your key and put it on your key chain.
Can you ever forgive me?
Honey, I already have.
We have to go to the police.
I don't know if this is the time for brutal honesty.
I've tampered with evidence in a homicide.
He could say that I hired him to kill you.
What about the man that I killed?
That has to do with David?
Well, it must!
Do you have any idea how many burglaries there are each day?
I don't think so.
What are we going to do now?
We'll have to disentangle ourselves from your artist friend.
Is there anything in his loft that could link David to us?
My ring.
You said it was being repaired.
Anything else?
Isn't that enough?
I'll get it.
Will you be home when I get back?
I'm on my way.
I'm calling for Mr. David Shaw.
Speaking.
It's Truman Travel, confirming your reservation for this afternoon.
Thank you.
I don't see why not.
Don't think I won't count it.
Naturally.
Think of that as your commemorative copy.
Nice doing business with you, Steve.
You take care.
Right this way.
Here we are, sir.
Okay, everything's fine.
Attention, please.
Last call for train 32 departing to Montreal in 4 minutes.
How's that for wet work?
You should thank me.
Artists are always appreciated more after they're dead.
You lose.
You're dying.
Steven's greatest hits.
What are you doing?
91st and Fifth.
Has there been a delivery today?
Welcome home.
It's time for a new start.
What do you say we go out for dinner this evening?
Just the two of us, someplace quiet in the neighborhood.
Like that?
Honey?
Let's stay home tonight.
I'll go pick up something to eat.
I won't.
Before I forget, I think we should have the locks changed.
Why?
Because I still can't find my key.
Must have put it back on his way in.
Didn't plan on that, did you?
Young David he was very unpredictable.
Maybe you'll share a cell.
Why?
Because of this?
I just found the key you lost.
You left it for him.
You mean the man you killed.
The blackmail proves it.
There's only one letter and I'm afraid that's vanished.
The thing is, we're just another married couple trying to work things out.
Because that's what she does on nights that I play cards.
Like the combination to the safe?
It's our wedding day, Steven.
You work it out on your fucking own!
I'll tell you when it's over.
The only way you leave me is dead.
I always thought that "bludgeon" had a spur-of-the-moment sound.
Maybe you could use one of these.
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.
Put the key back under the pipe then leave the same way you came in.
And what happens if the plan goes to hell?
It won't.
And then he attacked you?
What else could you do?
May God be with you.
And you as well.
This is the story of my village...
What?
Tell them.
He has given them the go ahead.
God has simply given them the go ahead.
Tell them, Schlomo... the Nazis...
I am telling.
I'll translate.
The Nazis have arrived.
The same will happen to us soon.
What would you tell your wives, children, grandchildren?
How can we save our community?
- We're thinking!
- If you wake up the children, I'll throw you out!
- I got it.
Stupid idea!
Only because I didn't want my Esther to marry your grandson!
- A false deportation train.
- Who's talking?
Repeat it, Schlomo.
Organizing a deportation train?
- Yes, us, the children.
We should be the deported and the Germans at the same time.
- Remember that name!
A train?
Of course!
A train!
- How do we get the money?
- And the uniforms?
- Jews are the best tailors.
- We'll make them ourselves!
- The weapons, the fake papers?
Weapons... why weapons?
We'll have to speak German without accent.
Jehuda, have you heard it?
- Even a deaf person has heard it!
Schlomo, I've made a list of all things I want to bring...
I'll just bring my list, that's all I have.
They shouldn't be sitting here watching the beautiful Esther pass by!
Will we ever return?
The Nazis.
- I've forgotten to buy flour...
- Nobody leaves the room!
- Jankele?
- I'm an accountant and suffer from stomach ulcer.
- A real German don't do that.
- How about you, Mordechai?
- I'm sorry, Rabbi, I can't do that.
Was I right to refuse?
- Why hasn't he asked you?
To the benefit of the community, the council have chosen those who can speak German fluently, with a minimum of accent, who are familiar with the Germanic culture, and who in the past have shown superior self-control.
The decision is final and irrevocable!
You are responsible to God to fulfill this mission.
Golda, I have told you, no pastries.
And besides, pastries are for Purim!
- Maybe we haven't arrived by then.
It sees the pastry, eats it and says "It's Purim!"
One can't discuss such matters with you...
And what's that?
Malka, you and Lea should make the bread.
Have we forgotten anything?
- Rich and handsome.
I'm sure.
Esther!
Marry me, please, before we leave!
No, Jossi.
I'll marry a real man!
A wooden chess game from Mrs. Grossmann.
That should be enough.
"Dear Israel Schmecht, dear cousin!"
Israel will join us and take part of our adventure.
He lives in Switzerland, after fleeing from his homeland Austria, which was attacked by Hitler, the barbarian.
He will give us some important help, teach us to speak fluent German, without any trace of Yiddish accent, as well as the culture, civilization and psychology of the people of Goethe, both bourgeoisie and simple soldiers.
To speak perfect German and to get rid of the Yiddish accent, just leave out the humor.
Do they know that they are subject to parody?
To buy one coach at a time is more expensive, but it is safer!
This is killing me, Mendel!
- We wont get it for under 10000.
- 5000, my last offer!
- Mordechai can't do anything anyway.
All coaches for German officers are furnished with leather.
- When real Germans enter the train...
Is this what I get in return for everything that I've taught you?
That is beautiful!
- Not so expensive!
- A train...
Yes, very good...
Think about it. "Unite!" He has only got one thing on his mind.
You'll give him the money, and he makes the ID documents and passes.
- To be sure nothing was forgotten.
He'll be back in four days time.
Do you want some cookies?
- Jossele, is that you?
- Yes, Mama.
Haven't you told your cousin Abi, that we are going to Palestine?
- I have, but he wont come with us.
Unbelievable, that we didn't know.
Everything will be different in the future.
Do you know what he said?
"Proletarians of all countries, unite!"
- What's he like?
- Can one be overage and still new?
- We are Jews, not proletarians.
Same thing with "proletarians", it's a code name for revolutionaries.
Enough now!
- Why a blue coach?
- No more paint.
- Let me finish.
Did I said that?
Find this horse-man Anton Levi!
- What has a horse-man got to do with trains?
Rabbi, Itzik is back!
Quickly, tell the council and Mordechai!
Jankele and all you others, quickly!
This is Schtrull Geitzl, the train driver.
A real Yiddish train driver!
Long live train driver Schtrull Geitzl!
- And the locomotive?
Here it is!
- Looks like a wreck!
- We have been fooled.
He'll travel around the world, believe me, Rabbi!
Wait until tomorrow morning.
It's because of the mist.
Hurry up!
Shovel and coal...
- Well, yes.
- Then, let's go!
- Rabbi, I am ready.
- Then let's go.
Mordechai, take command!
Sura, wake up the kids!
I'm not quite ready...
Children of Abraham and Moses, get on board!
Give space for the elderly.
Sit down quietly!
Mordechai, it's time to leave!
God protect us!
Grandma, we are on our way!
Yes, my angels, we are on our way.
The bank will grant you the credit!
Check if the steam pressure stands on 11, and that the lever is pushed forward...
The wheels should then move forward, that is, in clockwise direction.
Look over there!
Stop seeing Germans everywhere!
For the time being there aren't any.
- We are ready.
It's unfair that some are born poor and some born rich into this world.
- Marx is also saying that.
- I agree with comrade Jossi und Marx.
It would be more fair, if poor would be born rich into this world.
With peyots, tallit and kaftan?
Do you want to be the ideologist of the Soviet train?
A ghost train!
I am not drunk.
Rabbi!
Mordechai!
Where are they?
I want to talk to them.
- There are no Germans here.
They've discovered us!
Our train isn't scheduled in the timetable.
What timetable, what are you talking about?
So it's true.
What do we do now?
- It's coming from the opposite direction!
There will be an entire battalion waiting for us at the next station!
Rabbi, this line is one-track only.
They are probably already half-dead and sticked to the walls like flies!
What do we do?
We live in a train.
Sami, a real communist.
- Not only a Nazi, but a communist as well!
- One can't be a Nazi and a communist!
- What do you know?
I forbid you to meet him.
End of discussion!
- Can we try to bypass them?
- Nothing is impossible!
A good soldier makes anything possible.
I'm in command, I decide!
No, the people should decide!
We also want the privileges and the comfort that comes with being German.
My problem?
You want to sleep in my bed?
To be German is for those who have earned it, who worked for it!
Fascist!
Stop fighting.
I promise you all clean sheets in Palestine.
- Get back in the train.
- Keep your promises, Rabbi!
The final struggle has only begun!
We're entering a new chapter in history.
- What do you see in the map?
- That'll take time.
- Yes, but no one suspects that we have a ghost train.
Is that supposed to be a joke?
"For Whom", answer me!
- No, why did it fail?
- They changed route.
- What do you mean, for whom?
Oh my god, I'm probably next in turn...
- If he doesn't listen, let me talk to him.
Mordechai, at the next stop I'll move back to my coach, okay?
We'll never get there, Mama, will we?
- The Germans will find us and kill us.
We are still on our way.
We'll be in Palestine soon.
Don't you already feel the desert wind?
I will read you a story.
There was once a paradise on earth.
A vast desert, that seemed dry and inhospitable, but beneath all the sandy dunes there was a wonderful treasure.
Sami Schwartz, the party appoints you soviet secretary of the first coach!
- Fascist!
- Leave Sami alone!
I will never marry you!
You are awake, this is not a nightmare.
Who's talking about marriage?
Are you crazy?
Is it still a long way, grandma?
Yes, my love.
Alright, alright.
Come on, girls.
Hurry up!
They're letting them say a last prayer!
Mordechai, tell your men to remove their Nazi headwear!
The heads stay covered.
The scripts don't say anywhere that Nazi caps aren't allowed.
It's for me only to decide what my men should do.
I allow you to wear the kippah, but my men will leave their helmets on!
We encounter real Germans every day.
Therefore we need a real commander!
The Germans are praying with them!
Commanders are always right.
If it goes wrong, history will mention five cowards who escaped the scene.
We are Marxist-Leninist materialists!
Don't fight!
If there's a God or not, what's the difference?
- Have you ever asked if there's humanity?
Speak, Schlomo.
"God created man in his own image."
That's beautiful...
Schlomo as the image of God.
Who has written this sentence in the Torah?
Written without any modesty, comparing himself to God.
Could you repeat that?
So, the question is not whether there is a God or not, but whether there are any of us...
Bravo, that was a beautiful prayer.
Thank you, Schlomo.
"Man doesn't exist." Do I look like a chimpanzee?
One less.
Schlomo, why are you the fool?
I wanted to be a rabbi, but the position was occupied.
When they looked for a fool, I thought that I could be crazy on their behalf.
- Don't you ever feel lonely?
- No, there are enough crazy people.
I was talking about a woman.
Why didn't you ever have a wife, children and a home?
I'm not that crazy...
Does it bother you if I take your queen?
Mordechai, we're running out of supplies.
The children will soon have nothing more to eat.
Turn around.
Love me, Sami.
Now you may.
You do not have any responsibilities any longer.
Come on.
No!
If they are arrested and tortured, we wouldn't come very far.
Proletarians of all countries, unite!
But you just said we should separate..!
Wait, I want to talk to you.
Why did you do that?
Tell me.
I'm here!
We should leave!
They will torture him until he tells where the train is.
You fool!
What's going on?
Please, Mordechai, let's leave!
The others are true monsters, you can't imagine...
Who's against?
Ghost train!
Now you're telling me!
You're going to rot in jail!
That is true.
Not even Sami, my own son.
Everybody trembles, wishing for my success and that the train departs safely.
When they imagine the worst, guess what they to think.
That I'll be the first to bite the dust.
You know that's not true.
Would you burn your own people?
Then everything is okay.
It would be too beautiful... if you lets us fail so near our goal.
Sometimes I ask myself if You are a sadist.
- Mordechai, don't you hear his accent?
Schlomo, my brother, you're alive!
Palestine.
They are not Germans!
Rabbi, are the pigs allowed to board the train?
God will understand.
- Should I make a note?
- Whatever.
Mazel tov, my daughter, let me embrace you.
You have listened to your father.
Miron Pastai, the Gypsy.
You were good looking, wanted to make good you had dreams, you had a God.
What are you becoming?
Is that communism?
I will be with you till the end of the world.
I understand.
Have you swallowed your Stradivarius?
They still believe that they invented the violin.
- Whose in faver?
- What did he say?
Who is in favor?
Do you want something?
Then go away.
Have you ever loved a woman and wanted to live with her?
Yes.
Have you ever loved a woman?
Long time ago?
Do you still love her?
We're going to die, Schlomo.
Who is the woman?
It's you.
Schtrull, stop.
O my God, the Germans!
This is the end!
We are free!
When we arrived in the Soviet Union most of us stayed and became communists.
Others went to Palestine, especially the Gypsies...
Schtrull went all the way to China, where he became station-master in a small village.
The dictionary says "escape" means "to break loose, to bust free. "
Replacing her as Em City supervisor is Karl Metzger.
My rep is that I'm tough, but I'm fair.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
How far along are you?
We figure by tomorrow, we're on the other side of the prison wall.
- Don't you wanna know why?
I trust you.
- Take care of her.
- Fuck you.
There they go.
- How can you be so calm?
- What would you have me do?
I've been here five minutes, I got two bodies on my floor.
This is not the way shit's gonna happen with me here.
We find one more hole, who's going in it?
I'm putting one of you goddamn cocksuckers in the next fucking hole we find.
Who wants a shovel?
Goddamn it.
The tunnel was found in what used to be your pod.
Yes, he dug it.
If that's true, you should've come to us.
Terrified.
Busmalis warned him of the dangers, but they were so anxious to go.
Even so, these two should be punished.
Well, neither one is much of a discipline problem.
You can go.
McManus' revenge on me for screwing up outside, man.
You shot a guy six times.
Sure, you gotta look pretty before they plant you.
Death is a lot like life in Oz, man.
So just now, we loaded those two Aryan fucks into boxes, right, which get sent to funeral home for burial.
So my idea is, next time somebody dies, I get in the box instead.
Not if I get a couple of friends of mine to come to the funeral home and break me out.
Yeah, but what you gonna do with the real motherfuckers that died?
How hard is it to hide a couple of bodies up in Oz, son?
Of course, there are some who find that once they're free, life on the other side ain't all it's cracked up to be.
I'm here to see Sister Peter Marie.
Robert Sippel's out front asking for you.
Well, the last few days have been very difficult.
I had to go down to the courthouse and stand in line with ordinary people wanting fishing licences and learner's permits.
I stepped up to the counter and softly explained to the clerk why I was there.
Seek and ye shall find, right?
Hard enough getting employment as an ex-con, but once they discover that I've fondled a young boy...
Well, have you found a place to live?
You want me to let Robert Sippel move into a cell?
- You?
Yeah, as my assistant.
- Oh, yeah, well, I needed a...
As you can see, I'm not very organized.
You're still uncomfortable around me.
Chaplain's office.
He feels that he owes you that much, at least.
I don't really know what my intentions are except... I haven't seen him since that day.
Ten years is a long time to carry this shit inside.
Sorry to say "shit" in front of a priest.
Whatever I've done, I've done for righteous reasons.
Any laws I've broken don't deserve to be laws.
Thank you, officer.
I'm just doing my job, pal.
For once, I agree with that Nazi fuck.
What do you need?
I'm treating you like a patient, any patient.
Am I well enough to die?
Healthy enough to execute?
The next time I see you, Shirley, I'll be standing over a gurney about to poke you with a lethal injection.
Thank you, darling.
Do you hear me, or do I gotta have to translate?
I'm just waiting for the right moment.
- Yo, drop it now, all right?
I gotta go see Sippel at Benchley Memorial.
- l bet a CO was involved.
We're cross-checking staff medical records right now but it's gonna take some time.
Miguel, you gotta think this through.
- l'm trying, I'm trying.
How are you gonna fight them off?
If they fucking catch me, they're gonna fucking beat the shit out of me.
You gonna fucking hold up a crucifix?
He spent 20 years, 20 years in solitary.
Then he goes fucking crazy because of the Alzheimer's, right?
But to be in a little fucking room... I'll fucking go bugs in a day.
They put me in solitary, they might as well beat me to death.
Yeah, there is.
You see that?
When I did that, I was fucking nuts.
See, I know that now.
You know what I should've done instead?
I should've cut my fucking throat.
Hey, Gloria, I have to talk to you.
- How's Rivera?
- We'll know more in a few hours.
All right, Cyril's been moved to Em City.
My brother Cyril got slow because of me.
Get the fuck out of here.
Cyril got brain-damaged defending me.
Everything I have done since I've gotten here was to protect my ass so that I could make parole.
So I lost control again.
So... I gotta stay here with Cyril.
I mean, for once in my fucking life, I'm gonna be his big brother.
It's what I deserve.
Hey, fuck off.
The man had seven mismatched cuff links.
Who saves one cuff link?
Preston had style.
Chris, at last.
Give me a kiss.
- You're drunk.
- You bet your ass I am.
Did you miss me?
I've been out of the hole two days, I haven't spoken more than ten words to Beecher.
Yeah, I seen him.
He's a fucking mess.
- He's on the ledge.
I've known Vern since we were both doing time up in Lardner.
I've owed him ever since.
I don't love you.
Yeah, there are all kind of ways to escape from Oz.
Are you giving me orders, Kenny?
I know why you have come.
They've already told me we will meet.
I believe I was sent here for you.
If you don't change your ways, stop the drugs, the violence, you will die.
How long have you been in America?
Fifteen years.
You see?
Where you come from.
You disgrace our people.
Our people who have let oyinbo come in and use us?
Our people who don't protect what we have got?
Even so, when we die, our souls return to the place of birth.
You have abandoned yours.
You must embrace it if you want peace.
Well, Simon, your urine test came in negative.
So how are you feeling physically, detox?
I have the heart of a lion, Sister.
But you know, since the first time I came to Oz, I found:
He's got the tits and he's got Adebisi by the balls.
That was bad, what you said.
Yeah, well, in Oz, bad is good.
Man, they got some strange shit going on.
O'Reily, you a user?
Who's gonna get every pair of tits that comes in this place, huh?
Make the smart decision here.
We in business?
Now, as a sign of good faith, there's a little job I need done.
I'm going home.
Okay, Adebisi, settle down.
Let me first say, I'm really sorry, I didn't know much about your radio show.
Inside Oswald, we are restricted in what we see, hear, and are exposed to.
You know, when I was arrested, I thought to myself, "Hey, this is the will of Allah.
Said, every year, the governor grants clemency for a number of prisoners.
But he specifically wanted us to consider you.
This is a trick, right?
There has to be strings attached.
The celebration of Ramadan is at the centre of Islamic worship.
Therefore, I'm pleased, in the grand tradition of this holy time, to bestow clemency on a prisoner.
Kareem Said has been an outspoken critic of our administration, but political differences aside, he has been an outstanding member of the prison population.
Even after suffering a heart attack last year, he's continued to work with prisoners of every race and colour, especially the young, to instruct them, and guide them to better lives.
So I hereby grant Kareem Said a full pardon and I wish him well in his new life.
How do I feel?
I feel joyless.
The longing to be free became as palpable as the food that we eat.
And so, Governor Devlin, because even the cost of freedom can be too high, I refuse your pardon.
Officer, take him back inside.
Cocksucker.
Open the door.
Any hinky shit, you'll be refrying beans with Pablo Escobar again.
Don't even drive out to Jersey, not even on Sundays.
We can't fit it all!
Fucking crackheads and their small bills.
This is a token of my appreciation, for recommending Dr. Melfi.
Aren't they illegal?
They're cigars.
-Oh, they're dreamy, Ton.
-You're a good neighbor, Bruce.
They fell off a truck.
It's the biggest refrigerator you've ever seen.
And the other thing?
Juan Valdez has been separated from his donkey.
You know, Ton, I been watching you out back with your putter.
You ought to come to the club and play sometime.
Yeah, maybe, you know....
We'll see.
Here we go.
A score like this happens once in a lifetime.
Gotta make this work for us, legit.
Find a nice IPO, keep it spinning, live off the juice.
IPO, Initial Public Offering, stock, insider market trading shit.
Taking off.
Just may be!
Thank you so much for taking me to the theater.
We're supposed to be all weepy because the heat's off in some guy's loft?
I'm humming the scenery, Chrissy!
Fifth row center and dinner at Le Cirque!
I'm embarrassed to be hungry again.
After how many years with Tony Soprano's crew some shit has finally worked out.
Just when I was starting to wonder if, you know....
Wouldn't it be cool to own a restaurant like Le Cirque?
Madonna, with the careers.
The black guy over there, he look familiar?
Why don't you just forget about working and be with me?
Breast-feeding rug rats and spending the rest of your life at the gym.
With a husband who can't tell you where the money's from.
It's fucking discrimination, already!
About time.
Bold men make bold statements.
Your woman looks embarrassed.
Give me a couple of burger baskets.
He's only bold because he's semi-hooked up with the Tony Soprano crew.
-Nice.
-Must be the homie with the blue hat.
My name is Orange J. I'm down with Massive Genius.
There's business to be done.
This is a beautiful, beautiful home.
Smaller than my Hamptons crib, but that's bigger than Steven's.
It's Italian contractors obviously.
Look at all these gold records!
What do we have here?
You like that shit?
A little Christmas present to myself.
Isn't that a sight to behold?
I do so love a good firearm in my hand.
You people are all right.
Godfather, I seen that movie 200 times.
Godfather II was definitely the shit!
The third one a lot of people didn't like it, but I think it was just misunderstood.
So what business you want to discuss?
In the late '50s and '60s, he owned F-Note Records.
Yeah, Hesh was in the music business.
Jimmy's mother, who I'm content to call my aunt, is owed that money.
Feel free to enjoy the food and any other enjoyments.
That guy's a gangsta?
I'm a gangsta.
What do I got?
I sit in a fucking pork store, for chrissake.
Junior with his moldy sweaters, and he's a fucking boss.
You were just feeling so good about yourself.
Paid the DJs or busted heads to get them played on the air.
There were great Italian singers.
Fucking A. Frankie Valli, Dion, The Rascals, the whole Philly thing.
My dad used to talk about those guys.
Gangsta.
-Barb Wagner called, you remember her?
-The mayonnaisers from up the street?
They invited us to a barbecue.
Still with the brochures?
You believe how much it costs for a college education?
We got enough.
I know we got enough, but how much is enough?
God forbid, what if something should happen?
Call up old man Coletti, tell him not to put too much makeup on my face.
Don't joke around about this, Tony.
You'll be taken care of.
You always tell me that, "I'll be taken care of." By who?
What is with the look?
Did you just make a score?
You know, Tony, it's a multiple- choice thing with you.
Because I can't tell if you're old-fashioned, you're paranoid or just a fucking asshole.
So what do I tell the Wagners?
Do you want to go?
Sure.
Even Cusamano asked me to play a little golf with him at his club.
I'll talk to him.
-Remember Richie Santini?
-Yeah, you used to fuck him.
Yeah, we had our little phase.
You said yourself how much money there was in this thing.
You mean like, Richie Santini?
Would Massive Genius be interested?
Massive does owe me a favor.
I'm arranging a sit-down with Hesh.
I have met people, important people learned people skills, how to deal with big egos, solve problems.
And with my love of all kinds of music....
Maybe Alec Baldwin would come to our house.
This place has the flavor.
That gelding, name is Sydney.
You never wrote a song about him?
When you and Little Jimmy were writing all his hits did you write the music and him the lyrics or vice versa?
We had our own process.
One could write a song about a horse.
But to be a hit with your audience you'd have a cop on him, be ripped up the ass with a Mac 10, no?
So you bought horses with your royalties.
What about Little Jimmy's royalties?
He bought horse.
Music business back then, we broke all the rules as we went along.
You mean raping and pillaging.
Things haven't changed much, huh?
Ordinarily I'd be more than happy to stroll down Memory Lane with you but I want reparations.
That money bought my house at the Jersey Shore.
He's gotta do the right thing, that's what.
You're way out of line, kid.
Let's get some cold water on your head.
What's in this for you?
You're talking to the wrong white man, my friend.
My people were the white man's nigger when yours were still chasing zebras.
As far as Louis B. Mayer is concerned, what are you, nuts?
Now, a cashier's check made to a Mrs. Idella Willis will set it straight.
Or what?
What was it that she called him?
"That nice man," I think she said.
The Sopranos?
He was thanking me for the physician, which he is very happy with.
I think the only thing separating American business from the Mobs is whacking somebody.
Whacking!
He hangs around with Tony Soprano and it's "fucking this, fucking that."
But that bar with the goombah Murano glass.
I like Murano glass.
It ain't your type of music, but....
I like any kind of music that turns shit green.
As a metal band they were great, but this as far as I am concerned, blows away Matchbox 20.
But Richie and Vito are still the core of the band.
Now they're called Visiting Day.
This is some loud shit!
That's Richie.
And that's Vito.
This isn't the right place for them.
You suck!
Without the right help from you Visiting Day could end up in the miscellaneous V section.
You interested?
I'll be right back, okay?
Excuse me.
Richie, the guy's 30, still lives with his parents.
It's because of the accident.
Richie had third-degree burns from trying to grill that trout with a downed power line.
But at the same time, being electrocuted turned his life around.
Well, you did some ace fucking selling.
You think?
It's art.
Berry Gordy, whatever, he had to see it in the Supremes.
It's an instinct.
I see it in Richie.
Yeah, probably is.
I'm really fucking doing it!
And it's all thanks to you.
We're brought up to think the americani are fucking bores.
But the average white man's no more boring than the millionth conversation over who should have won, Marciano or Ali.
Am I to understand that you don't consider yourself white?
Now, he's Italian, but he's americano.
What Dad called a "Wonder Bread Wop." He eats his Sunday gravy out of a jar.
Dinner party.
You should have stopped by.
Live right next door.
You didn't hear any strange noises last night in your neighborhood?
Noises?
Like someone screaming in pain?
Probably a television set.
You saw my house?
Oh, this looks good.
-That place in Garfield.
The only thing better than salsiccia is a pair of tits.
It's a hell of a piece of meat.
Jack, you're a stockbroker, right?
Any changes in the market coming?
Rand, you hear from Ross on Dexplex?
Dexplex?
Let's not talk business for once.
American Biotics.
They're close to a side-effect-free anti-impotence drug.
You guys play the stock market?
Oh, we don't just play we win.
That's take 62.
We ought to just bag it.
Okay, we're bagging it.
We should've bagged this days ago when it was perfect.
I wish I had thought of that.
Maybe some rest.
Hey, hey, fuck that!
I paid for three days' studio time.
It'll only cost me more to pack it up and come back again.
We got through the instrumental tracks with no problem.
I'm fucking beat.
Here, try this.
Dude, I don't do drugs anymore, okay?
Look, the problem, Christopher is the bass and the drum tracks were miked wrong from the beginning!
Hey, King of Rock, you're out of your depth.
Let me tell you something.
Thank you, but I've recorded in Denmark.
You wanna know what the problem is?
Where are the fucking choruses?
All your songs, you got no choruses.
What is he, nuts?
I'm going to AA, you fucking jerk-off!
What-- Get back in the booth!
So we take it from the top.
We'll use a ukulele.
I can't believe you!
5,000 shares.
Yes, American Biotics.
-What, are you spying on people now?
-I live here.
You playing Wall Street now?
CNBC is a very interesting channel.
When you get married, you will.
Tony, you ever play that place in Orlando?
-He was a golf fanatic, that's right.
-So you guys watch AE.
I mean, in your opinion.
-What do you mean, real?
Did you really have to cut your finger and take an oath?
Like gridlock on Times Square today, isn't it?
Traffic in Manhattan's worsened since "Don't block the box."
You got a lot of friends in New York, Tony?
San Gennaro, the feast with the kids.
What do you think of when you hear Mulberry Street?
You ever see that picture of Galante dead, with a cigar in his mouth?
How fucking old you think I am?
You don't have to answer this if you don't want to, but I gotta know.
Did you ever meet John Gotti?
What was he really like?
Like Good Humor, except the trucks had bungalow roofs on.
Was Gotti a silent partner in that?
I don't know nothing about that.
Just know that when the company folded and they were auctioning off the last truck the one with the peaked roofs, you're right, Cuse.
When they were auctioning off the last truck and I wanted it as a souvenir Gotti outbid me.
Gave me a ride home.
You know, he rang that bell the whole way home?
They're waving at us.
Oh, I love this part.
This is good.
They got it going on.
So?
Well, I think it's not good.
Want to be more specific?
Maybe it's not your era, no offense.
You're just pissed about the sit-down.
Get the fuck out of here and stop wasting my time.
This Vito is a great fucking guitar player, Hesh.
He's a great guitar player.
Fucking Massive is a genius, so what the fuck was he talking about?
Every time he opened his mouth, we'd piss ourselves laughing.
But Jimmy didn't mind because he got to hang out with us, the popular crew.
Because he wanted to hang out with us, he'd belt it right out.
We'd fucking roll on the floor, laughing.
And then, you know, when the laughs got old, we stopped calling him.
Wasn't until years later I found out the poor prick went home every night and cried himself to sleep.
Then when I found out, you know I felt bad.
You thought Cusamano was your friend.
You live, you learn.
Can I ask you a question?
Whatever happened to Jimmy?
Some fucker's on the phone for you.
You do know what this means?
Why don't you back up a bit?
You know, let sleeping dogs lie.
This is what I think about this gangsta rap shit:
You probably got a degree in sociology from a city college.
Killed a man.
Later on I got a degree, but urban planning.
You were close.
Don't press it.
I'm gonna do my part to keep Mr. Rabkin's people working.
What's that mean?
Expect to hear from Goldstein, Baum and Woronov.
They represent us in the lawsuit.
I would, of course, have to countersue.
I'll see you in court.
Fucking legal fees.
It's a new fucking day.
Fucking depressing.
Now, this is a Donatella Versace.
MTV Awards?
Nothing.
I thought that fight was over.
You know how I use positive visualization?
You should mentally prepare for the fucking possibility that Visiting Day sucks.
Silvio, he owned rock clubs in Asbury.
You're just trying to keep me down!
I'll shut up.
You saying I don't have talent?
I branched out, made new friends, new horizons and you can't stand that!
I don't think I can stay here anymore.
I need a finger.
-What's in the box?
-Sand.
Beautiful!
You're cute when you're a bad boy.
You're awfully chipper today.
-So what are you doing with the box?
-Good, how you doing?
Fine, thanks.
Listen you know, that nickname....
Hang onto it and I'll come get it when I need it.
-No new members until old members die.
-Nobody's dying?
-Nothing we could do anything about.
Now, that's a hit.
Shit, Jean, I don't know.
Could be anything.
Don't touch it.
Hi, Louie, come on.
It's time to go to school.
Pick a spot on the back wall, don't take your eyes off it, and speak loudly.
- Good luck.
- Morning, Muttons.
I doubt it.
So, this is not a debate.
I think Grove should dump the uniforms and have casual dress all year round.
After it's over, I want you back in your uniform.
- He's my man.
OK, Josh, later.
Down boy, you've made your point.
Now we've all heard from Josh Bryant for the affirmative.
Now we'll hear the rebuttal from Mia Thermopolis, who will present the negative argument against our proposition.
Look out, she's gonna hurl.
Mia, finish up with Mrs. Talmond and then you can take a break.
Mr. Walsh, stop twisting.
You'll strangle yourself.
- You threw up?
- And you ran away.
- I'm trying to forget about it.
Can I have some shoes and chalk, please?
- Your grandmother called.
This is the first time she's contacted us, what's she want?
She's in town, she wants to have tea.
Isn't this the grandmother who made you two get a divorce?
Why should I go see this snobby lady who ignores us?
Just go see her, please?
Tension.
She said your father hoped that you two would meet someday.
The school tours are on Saturday, young lady.
Please come to the front door.
Thank you very much.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
And we need new pillows for the Prime Minister's wife.
She's allergic to goosefeathers.
Now, if you'll sit down, she'll be with you in a moment.
You look so... young.
Thank you.
Before I... shoot, I have something I want to give you.
Thank you.
And that was my great grandmother's.
What did you want to tell me?
Something I think will have a big impact upon your life.
The tea is served, ma'am.
He was the Crown Prince of Genovia.
What about him?
You're joking.
Shut up!
- I understand, thank you.
Why on earth would you pick me to be your princess?
Queen Clarisse, my expectation in life is to be invisible and I'm good at it.
Amelia, I had other expectations, also.
In my wildest dreams, I never expected this to happen, but you are the legal heir, the only heir to the Genovian throne and we will accept the challenge of helping you become the princess you are.
I can teach you to walk, talk, sit, stand, eat, dress like a princess.
Given time, I think you'll find the palace a pleasant place to live.
I refuse to move to, and rule, a country, and do you want another reason?
I don't want to be a princess.
Well, that went well, didn't it?
I was young.
I wanted to paint.
- Where are you going?
- Straighten up the royal bed chamber.
After the divorce, we all discussed it.
OK, you know what?
I don't feel protected.
You try living for 15 years thinking you're one person and in five minutes you find out you're a princess.
Just in case I'm not enough of a freak already, let's add a tiara.
Fat Louie... you are so lucky you don't know who your parents are.
I have this favorite photo of Philippe.
We had so much fun here in college.
He was so full of joie de vivre, always laughing and smiling.
I remember.
Here it is.
Philippe was ready to be king.
Then the terrible accident.
Well, as always, this is as good as it's gonna get.
I can't wait until she's 18.
I'm going back to bed.
The three of us have to talk.
OK. ls there something else about me and my life that I might want to know about?
Are you two waiting to take me on a talk show to let me know I have a twin sister who's a duchess?
You have a cousin who's a contessa.
However, you desperately need some instruction.
I speak for the entire Genovian parliament and the royal family.
Families don't do stuff like that to one another, OK?
- Where is she going?
- She has a tower?
Please, just come down from there.
Most kids hope for a car for their 16th birthday, not a country.
Just make yourself comfortable.
I can't, I'm late for a meeting with my guidance counselor.
I'm late for a meeting with Spain and Portugal.
Mia promises to attend princess lessons until your ball.
It's not my ball, it's Genovia's Annual Independence Day Ball.
I'm sorry.
Now can you both live with that?
I'm gonna be 16 this year, and my mom traded two paintings to get me a 1966 Mustang.
I suppose I could donate something to this vehicle.
- Good morning, Mr. Robutusen.
- Who is this gentleman?
My neighbor, but you wouldn't want to meet him.
He doesn't have very nice manners.
Good morning.
- You have two limousines?
The flags allow me to park anywhere.
- We keep the flags.
- Sorry, Joseph.
You can call me Joe.
Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Of course.
Oh, my word.
Tell, me, Mia, is it true about your speech?
It's a slow pitch, you can catch it on a bounce.
I'm on the verge of becoming a nutcase, and my parents think I need an attitude adjustment.
We ran out of things to talk about when I was eight.
At least your dad's still alive.
I know, but after all, he was my dad.
Be fair, they were beautiful presents.
You got it.
Talk loud, I got a band rehearsing.
You've been listening to the sounds of Flypaper.
It sounded really good.
- This is not my day.
- I'll do some labor free.
"I'll do some labor free."
You sweet on her?
Your Majesty, the diplomatic pouch has arrived and she's here.
Charlotte, take notes, will you?
The neck is seemly.
- Who has nails like these?
When walking in a crowd, one is under scrutiny all the time.
So we don't schlump like this.
Princesses never cross their legs in public.
Why don't you tuck one ankle behind the other, and place the hands gracefully on the knees.
Charlotte, I think it's time for tea.
Tell me, how does my mother, or any person for that matter, go into a parent-teacher conference and come out with a date?
Mr. O'Connell is not married, he's not living with anyone, plus he's not pierced, tattooed or hair plugged.
Do you realize how rare a find that is south of Market Street?
It's just that Patrick...
Mr. O'Connell, he's such a nice man, a real gentleman, and I haven't met one of those in a long time.
I can't do anything right any more, can I?
- I can't do this, I'm a girl.
Bring it on.
When I purchased the pumps, they asked if I wanted them wrapped or if I wanted to wear them.
All right, closing.
Going UP-
Going down.
I've never put on pantyhose, but it sounds dangerous.
But enough etiquette for the day.
Just normal kind, like...
We have a Genovian alternative.
Good attitude.
Spin in.
- Now, you may go home.
Thank you.
You've been wearing black too long.
What, has your grandma turned into the big bad wolf?
Cute, Jeremiah, but a way to a girl's heart is not by treating her like a vending machine.
Always prompt.
We're so pleased you could make yourself available.
Your Majesty.
We won't waste time, let the work begin.
My granddaughter, Amelia.
We have a limited number of days before the state dinner.
I would like your ladies to sign our confidentiality agreement.
Majesty, they know what is a secret.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave, come back and be surprised.
Charlotte, watch him like a hawk.
So we begin, Principessa.
Like a wolf.
Do you wear contact lenses?
If Brooke Shields married Groucho Marx, their child would have your eyebrows.
This is something we make up.
- Lilly, the car is here.
- I'm coming.
Thanks for the ride.
What?
Michael, don't always think you can get a ride with us...
Who destroyed you?
You think it looks that bad?
You look ridiculous, you should sue.
You sold out.
She has a hat.
- What did you just say to me?
Wait. - Why?
I can't, this is a royal secret.
Class has begun.
Mia, I'm sorry, hats are against the dress code.
Looks like she got a head transplant.
Well, I think it rocks, and you know what?
The roses are lovely, but now we need fountains, lights in the trees.
The Japanese Embassy has a waterfall, why can't we have fountains?
- We have a fountain up there.
Amelia, let's continue.
And so, you wave to them and acknowledge them gracefully.
They had an exhibition at Woodstock.
Some moms help their kids with homework, you do this.
This is more fun than princess lessons.
We could put it together, together.
Not you, I don't even know you.
- Maybe it's a protest.
Princess Mia, who is your favorite actor?
Why are they calling her princess?
Mia, your mother's on her way.
The Queen is getting out.
Why all the secrets?
All we keep hearing is "no comment." Do you have a comment?
Are you taking the Princess home?
The point is it was pride and ego that drove me to know that royalty would see one day the beauty was mine, the hair was mine.
That I, Paolo Puttanesca, was responsible...
What is it like in Genovia, Your Majesty?
Do people just fawn over you?
She has never been normal, she was born royal.
We cope with the press every single day, and we will do it again.
Your mother is right.
We had a bargain.
Polite but vague.
Mia is the daughter of local eclectic artist, Helen Thermopolis.
They currently live in a refurbished firehouse south of Market Street.
Number one, no privacy.
Number two, you always have to look just right.
Number three...
So... can't I tell everyone I simply quit?
Like the fancy dinner coming up.
Entering.
At the Grand Ball, you enter with the Queen, but at the State Dinner, you enter unaccompanied.
Shoulders back smile.
They're all happy to see you
Well done, the worst is over.
Easy on the schnapps, remember the Winter Dinner.
I'm not allowed to go to the party.
Dinner is served.
Her Majesty, Queen Clarisse.
There's Ryan and there's Bridget.
Wash your hands.
Shall we adjourn to the Grand Ball for coffee?
Sorry I let you down, Dad.
Good night, Louie.
- Actually, I found it rather funny.
I haven't sat in the front seat of a car in the longest time.
So where are you taking me?
OK, I'll get the change.
It's hard the first time, do it again.
Go, you're doing good.
I want one of these.
But?
Not I, though many people thought I did, or anybody else.
Philippe knew that my first born, his brother Pierre, wanted to abdicate which he did, eventually, to join the church.
Your father realized that the love he could have for one person, or even two, could not make him forget the love he felt for his country and its people.
It was the hardest thing he ever had to do.
- Do you want a bite of this?
- Why, it's delicious.
I know it's the fastest way back to the consulate, but I hate this hill.
I do believe I'm beginning to feel that corn dog.
I haven't got it.
I will and last, but not least, driving without a license.
Accompanied by an adult whose license expired 45 years ago.
- It's all right, I understand.
- I understand perfectly.
Won't you please kneel?
- Artie Washington, San Francisco.
Arthur Washington, and I dub thee...
- Chivalry ain't dead, you know.
- Noble Arthur, how very kind.
- Please take the car to Doctor Motors.
Wave good-bye, that's a queen.
Bruce, how 'bout getting on your royal carriage and getting us out of here?
Would you consider you and the princess best friends?
- That's a funny name.
- Will you take a picture with me?
Step into my office.
You OK?
- I look like an asparagus.
- But a very cute asparagus.
Don't worry, I'm just gonna wear my blue suit.
Are you nervous about the beach party?
He is not a Backstreet Boy clone, he's a sailor.
OK, I'm gonna go change now.
Here to tell us all about it, please welcome Lana and the Lanettes.
- That is so amazing.
And now it's time again for your favorite talk show host, direct from Grove High School, the lovely Lilly.
It's Saturday night, and welcome to my cable show, Shut Up and Listen.
Later on in my show I will be joined by our very own Princess Mia, to discuss her positive opinion of the Save the Sea Otter Movement.
Hello, folks.
Hey, Princess, give us a smile.
Wave everybody, you're on TV.
- I am so sorry about all of this.
Actually, it's kinda cozy in here.
While we're waiting, how about a foot massage?
That would be so wonderful, thank you.
Actually, I mean you give me one.
And, indeed, it is the queen of hearts.
Thank you, Jeremiah, for your potpourri of prestidigitations for the past hour.
I go to Grove High School.
Sorry, it's hard to keep up with who we're not talking to.
- Yeah, Josh is such an idiot.
We'll make sure no one bothers you.
Thank you, that's really nice of you.
She's got her bathing suit off.
Now.
That was the scream of Princess Mia.
Come here, Mia.
It was really bad.
My foot didn't even pop.
Not to put too fine a point on it, yes, you did.
I think you're making a wise decision to abstain from the job.
I suppose I won't come to the ball, then.
Just because you don't want to be princess, doesn't mean you're in exile.
You can come in now.
If I may say so, that did not go very well.
Is this the way a princess should act?
My information tells me that boy was using her.
The kiss was merely a device so he'd get his 15 minutes of fame.
Why didn't she have enough common sense to deal with this?
She showed great respect and gracefully accepted your criticism.
You're saying that as a queen, I was too harsh on her.
I was critical of the person who could become the next ruler of my country.
I'm saying as a grandmother, you might have been too harsh on your granddaughter.
- Do you think she can do it?
I thought so, too.
Can I just talk to you for a minute?
So, I was stuck with Happy Houdini while you're making out with the yachting yahoo.
I'm sorry I missed your cable show, and I'm just really sorry.
I can't believe you hung me up, after all I did for you.
You didn't keep it a secret how jerky you thought my being a princess was.
But the truth is, you being a princess is kind of a miracle.
What miracle?
Wanting to rock the world but having zip power like me, that's a nightmare.
But you, wow.
What is so wow?
What more of a miracle do you want?
We'll just have to find a different miracle, not more, just different.
I hate it when they move in like that.
It's not a championship game, it's just gym class.
Just hit the ball.
I don't want to flunk you.
Come on, you can do it.
Would you rather hit a beach ball?
Order me a pizza, pepperoni.
Run, Mia!
All the way, Mia.
Safe, and you passed.
It's open, come on in.
Michael, how are you?
What?
I know you're still mad at me for blowing you off, and I'm really sorry I did.
It could be fun.
You can wear sweatpants for all I care.
Don't worry about me.
Go sit by Jeremiah, I'll be there in a minute.
She's wearing that dorky hat again.
- You want to see a trick?
My portfolio's increased by 30 percent since last quarter...
Listen, my friends and I were wondering was the sweater designed for you, or did the knitting machine just blow up?
Is one of your magic tricks your hair?
That is such a cute cheerleading outfit, it's so clean cut.
You're such a freak.
I was in a very important meeting.
It was found among his possessions.
It's locked.
If you open the locket I gave you, it becomes the key.
It's a real job.
I would be so afraid that I would disappoint the people of Genovia, and I couldn't bear to disappoint you again.
Well, as I said, I have faith in you.
I'm a writer.
I write soaps, soap opera.
- That's what the character said.
I'll see you tonight, then.
I do have one favor to ask.
Make a speech.
Do you think, maybe, considering my history with the press, it would be better if you did it?
You wouldn't stop driving your Mustang just because a couple of insects hit the windshield, would you?
- I'll have Joseph pick you up at...
I am sorry.
Oh, my dear.
Pardon me, I have to go get the band ready.
Should you be going to get Princess Mia?
Mia told Clarisse her mother would bring her.
Helen just arrived and said Mia was waiting for you.
- Do you think it's going to rain on us?
- Umbrellas up.
Come on.
Don't do this, baby.
- I didn't order pizza.
We get a call, we deliver, that's our motto.
Do we have any news on the von Troken matter?
Talk to me.
It's wonderful.
You're not very good at lying.
- Thank you.
The press are starting to complain about making their deadlines.
Is this punishment for driving without a licensed driver in the front seat?
I am invisible and I am wet.
The press is wondering if it would be possible while we're waiting...
No interviews until later in the evening.
We're meeting Baroness and Baron von Troken.
Is it true if the teenager refuses the princesship, your family will take over Genovia?
They must have a legitimate Renaldi blood relative or we rule.
Pretty and fine.
Thank you so much for your patience.
I have an announcement to make.
She's styling a wet, sort of grunge-look hairdo, and is wearing a sweatshirt, jeans and Docs.
Would you care to say a few words?
Yes.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Think they're trying to save money on the gown?
Hello, I'm Mia.
Get your tiara ready.
I'm really no good at speech making.
Normally, I get so nervous that I faint or run away or even get sick.
But you really didn't need to know that.
But then I wondered how I'd feel after abdicating my role as Princess of Genovia.
Then I realized how many stupid times a day I use the word
Sorry, I'm going too fast.
If I were Princess of Genovia, then my thoughts and those of people smarter than me would be much better heard and just maybe, those thoughts could be turned into actions.
I hope you didn't order your stationary yet.
You made it.
They had the same idea I had, but now the garden is occupado.
Why me?
Because you saw me when I was invisible.
Dear Diary, today is my first official day as Princess of Genovia.
We'll land in a few hours and I'll meet the Parliament and people before beginning my royal duties.
Mom is, of course, moving with me and will continue painting without the balloons.
Lilly and Michael are planning to spend their summer vacation at our, can you believe it, palace.
They're even having my Mustang brought over, which I can legally drive in two weeks.
Everybody's got pre-coronation jitters, including me.
Everybody except Fat Louie, he's totally adapted to being a royal.
I guess he was one all along.
Princess, look out the window and welcome to Genovia.
- Virus bitch going down?
Why do doctors always have such lousy handwriting?
I paid that Manticore creep five grand and what do I get?
A bunch of scribblings I can't even read.
Joshua, what are you doing?
You wanna help?
Um... get me another pencil.
I've read about your work and I thought you might be able to help.
Because someone wanted me dead.
Pencil, pencil, pencil...
"Burnt Sienna."
"Chocolate Mousse."
Ahh... oh, pretty wack.
- What's up, big fella?
Maybe when Father was mixing you together, he put Picasso in your DNA.
Picasso in my cocktail...
We're not sure if he's specifically purposed for something or just an experiment.
I'm talking to you.
Sir!
- Are you all right?
White wants this guy transported ASAP.
Never turn your back on them.
They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon.
I was hoping maybe you could hook me up with one of your doctor friends.
Anyhow, I'd really like to hear from you.
I don't have any money.
It's mine.
- This could be worth some serious coin.
Take it.
No, those ham hocks aren't worth that much.
I want you to.
- Organic chemistry?
- Bedtime reading.
So what did you wanna talk to me about?
I've been trying to get in touch with Lydecker.
Police say no one could've survived.
- They don't know Lydecker.
- At least you still have White.
I figure I'll run them through a few archaeological databases.
Business or pleasure?
A woman contacted Eyes Only.
- Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
- Hey, even Eyes Only's got to pay the bills.
I like it.
- Look at the use of colour.
No, on second thought, you leave it here.
Grab some beer and some ham hocks, you got yourself a party.
I must meet this artist.
He's... he's shy.
Listen, my clients don't just want pictures to hang on their walls.
They want the opportunity to engage with the artist, to interact with minds more creatively fertile than their own.
Thank you.
Oh yeah, yeah, he's painting night and day.
Can't get enough palimpsests and cerulean paint to keep up with his bursting organic energy.
- She liked it?
- The police find any forensic evidence?
It caught a glimpse of someone, but nothing we can make out.
- I'd like to see it.
- There's a copy of it in here.
Who could have done this?
It'll have to be during the day when my husband's at work.
He doesn't know that I'm here.
The truth is, he doesn't care much for Eyes Only.
He thinks what you people do is subversive.
It's OK.
He's such a smart little boy.
- I can't even spell that.
That's him when he was three.
He's a good-looking boy.
Said she loved it even more than the first.
Said she wants to get together and discuss your blossoming artistic sensibility.
- Yeah, you did pretty well, huh?
- Bad idea.
But you're also, to be frank, a dog-boy.
People afraid of things that are different.
Josh, don't be like that, come on.
White grid paper with scribblings all over it.
It's Logan.
They gotta be around here somewhere, right?
Gotta help find virus bitch papers!
- It's him.
- She's not a bad person.
- Married to him, isn't she?
- She doesn't know what he does.
She doesn't see the blood on his shirts?
If she knew, she wouldn't have come to Eyes Only.
Well, maybe if White wasn't so busy trying to kill me and mine, he could do something about it.
I can correct for the spherical distortion.
There.
Transgenics.
My guess is they couldn't get to White, so they went after his kid as payback.
White brought it on himself.
- How?
- You see this?
I'm running the image through an enhancement filter.
With any luck, it will clear up enough to be readable.
In the meantime, I'm gonna go see Wendy before the man of the house comes home for dinner.
- I'm coming with you.
- You gotta be kidding.
Joshua has been reviewed in the Artist's Weekly.
"A staggering work of raw genius."
"'Joshua number one' gives voice to the angst of expressionism, while revelling in its spectacular ambiguity."
"The medium is truly the message."
Rita, we're gonna need "Joshua number two" back.
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible.
- You sold it?
- No, no, it's part of my private collection.
- Yeah, it should be all there.
Two more?
See, it's all in the wrist.
Good.
Genetic engineering?
Government cover-up?
I mean, even if any of this was true, Ames has nothing to do with it.
My husband is a good man.
- We just want to help you.
- Ames, what's going on?
- I was about to ask you the same question.
- Well, that you... that Ray...
You've known all along, haven't you?
You knew that these transgenics took our son and you never told me?
- You son of a bitch!
- You animals took my son!
I should take you out, break your miserable neck and pretend you never existed!
But I'm not that kind of animal.
- Ames, oh, God...
Let's get out of here.
Wait.
You deserve whatever pain life gives, but your wife and son don't.
That's not gonna happen.
Then I'm afraid the deal's off.
Can't quite make it out yet, but it shouldn't be too much longer.
It all seemed so normal.
We dropped a pretty big bomb over there today.
Let me give you a little advice from my brief sojourn in the art scene.
They'll be bustin' down your door for a "Joshua".
The paint fumes are turning your brain into oatmeal.
You can buy her a whole hospital.
Any luck finding my papers?
I'll take that as a no.
- Yeah, they rocked... for a while.
It's an ID badge for an outfit called RCF Environmental Clean-up and Disposal.
Got an address for a site they're working on downtown: 5th and Grand.
Got it.
I don't like the guy myself, but you can't just go around grabbing people's kids.
There's some pictures they found near Lydecker's car.
Looks like some kind of dig site.
The Manticore symbol.
The place you found is a Kiloma burial ground from the early 1800s.
- Why was the Manticore symbol there?
- Good question.
Found another one in a Mesopotamian burial chamber, 5000 BC.
Another one in an Andean tomb in Atacama, Chile, 2000 BC.
Second-century Etruscan catacombs, seventh-century Northumbrian Celtics,
All I can figure is that Manticore or some precursor has been around longer than we realised.
- You don't think he's behind all this?
Could be he knows a lot more than he's telling.
- You scared me.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you come in.
I better get that.
Ames, is it Ray?
How much do you want?
How do we even know he's alive?
We'll be there.
- Should we call the police?
Wen... you know I love you, right?
I know.
Something's wrong.
Where are they?
They're not coming.
What do you mean?
How do you know?
- Where's Ray?
I want my son!
- He's not your son any more.
There was genetic breeding going on.
But you... you just couldn't leave things alone.
When I had Ray taken, you couldn't accept it.
You had to go out and find him on your own.
Max, the Whites had two miscarriages before Ray.
I didn't want it to end like this, but now I don't have a choice.
As far as the police'll be concerned, we came to meet the men who took our son.
They double-crossed us and you were killed.
At the end, they kill the mother.
I took a bullet myself.
Haven't you done enough?
Surprised?
You think you and your little Manticore progeny are special?
Transgenic scum!
You think those geeks with their chemistry sets and their gene banks have their greasy little paws in the future?
- You don't know what you're up against.
- I should've cancelled your ass.
You couldn't because you're too weak.
Pain is a phantom of the mind.
Hold it right there!
That's an expensive and important piece you've got there, Mister.
Is that you?
My painting. "Joshua number two."
I told your representative you could have the painting if you'd just ask for it in person.
Joshua, it doesn't matter to me what you look like.
It all makes sense now.
People afraid of what they don't understand.
You're too good for us, Joshua.
- You're special.
You are... the one and only...
Joshua.
What about White?
And what do they want with Ray?
- I wish she would understand.
It's time for you to be with other people like us.
You be good now.
And now, for your entertainment pleasure... while we get ready for the main event... give it up for the Gat Boyz!
All right now, shit birds, y'all both know the rules.
Let's box.
Now remember, brother convicts... if you learned how to act... they wouldn't have to fight inside of a cage.
And be on your best behavior, too... 'cause we don't want no incidents, all right?
Now, let's see what the pride of Loda... has to offer against the great Monroe.
Excuse me, sir, we just got some big news.
Now, Vern Van Zant said he got those... brand-new tattoos just for this occasion.
Your lawyers have filed all the expected appeals... but realistically, what do you think of your chances, of getting out before serving... the full sentence of 6 to 8 years?
Boxing experts tend to agree... that even as little as two years in a prison... without proper training could mean the end... for a boxer your age.
But when an athlete is removed from competition...
That's where you're making one big mistake right off.
How do you define that?
Iceman, last week after you were convicted... boxing's various so-called governing bodies... began stripping you of your title belts... stripping you...
This fight with Manfredy is meant to be... just a tune-up for George "The Iceman" Chambers... hopefully leading to the unification bout... with Montel Briscoe... undefeated holder of the WBC crown,
The two biggest names in boxing on a collision course... sometime next year... assuming the Iceman gets by the South American challenger,
It's round 1 and one to go, and it's all Iceman!
He's stalking Manfredy, chasing the big South American,
Oh, and a right-hand uppercut, That staggered Manfredy!
Well, Carlos Manfredy... gets a one-way ticket back to Brazil!
Are you fighting Montel next?
Does that include Montel?
Oh, yeah, that damn sure includes Montel.
But my first guess is you're a few million short.
Well, first of all, I'm gonna go to L.A... you know, see some friends... then I'm gonna do a little partying.
He's the champ.
If this was my house, I could get up and leave.
Maybe you'd like to meet him, Mr. Ripstein.
I'll tell you when I want to talk to him.
Why couldn't your high-priced team of lawyers... convince a judge and a jury?
I have received over 170 requests... for interviews with you, Mr. Chambers.
I have turned them all down,
We house only murderers, armed robbers, rapists... and those with connections to gangs... and other forms of organized crime.
The state is trying to spare lesser criminals... the contaminating influence of these more hardened types.
If you'd take advantage... of this opportunity to apologize... to this woman and to sports fans... and the American public for letting them down... heck, even the former president of the...
Man, fuck the president!
I ain't apologizing... not to you, not to her, not to nobody!
And you lucky I got this damn gate between you and me... or I'd rip you a new asshole, you judgmental motherfucker!
You got a name?
Mingo.
Mingo, move your shit, stay out of my way... and we'll get along just fine.
I don't want no trouble, champ.
Well, for some of us others, we have rights, too... and I had the right to say no if I didn't want to.
I want everybody to keep your distance.
I don't need to make no new friends... or hear no sad stories on why they're here.
I ain't loaning' nobody no money... so you tell 'em don't even ask.
And I don't want nobody talking to me... unless I talk to 'em first.
You're a good champeen,
Who the hell are you?
Yeah, my manager, Yank Lewis, he told me to say hello.
I don't remember him.
He said you two were friends in Miami... about twenty-five years ago.
I didn't have any friends in Miami.
You're a good champeen... but we got a champeen right here... and he can kick your ass.
Who's the punk in here you got in mind?
Oh, did I hurt your feelings?
Mr. Ripstein thinks he can whip up on you, man... but no offense.
Not trying to cause any trouble here.
Which one of these suckers in here is Monroe Hutchen?
He's over there in line, wearing a white cap.
You Monroe Hutchen?
I guess you know who I am.
Are you the champion in here?
Champion... heavyweight or any other kind they got.
I didn't even know they had boxing in a place like this.
I'm giving you another chance.
I'm inclined to overlook what happened this afternoon... and not make it a par of your official record,
Look, let's get something straight, Mr. Warden.
There's gonna be a whole lot of people... askin' a whole lot of questions... and you and your little crew here better know that.
One who happens to be a world champion... and a potential public relations nightmare.
Heavyweight champ.
Man gave me a cheap shot.
The warden understands... what he's doing is unfortunate... but unless Mr. Hutchen and the Iceman are separated... there will be enormous pressure... for another physical confrontation,
Nobody likes this... but Mr. Hutchen's presence is an incitement to violence... and he will be kept in there until such time... as we can make arrangements for his travel to another facility.
New duty roster just got posted.
Look, since we're gonna be stuck together... what you in here for?
You know, champ, I don't mean to be... telling you what to do or anything, but... it's not considered polite to ask why we're here.
Who's this chump?
OK, Ratbag, what you in here for?
-Me?
You hit people much?
What do you mean?
You know, punch people.
You want to hit me?
What, are you kidding?
All you gotta do is hit me one time... and I'm telling you, man, it'll make you feel good... and it ain't gonna hurt me none.
And it ain't some nickel-and-dime convict... beating up on fools in prison!
Get that bitch outta here.
I ain't gotta spend my time makin' potato salad.
Where I come from... we didn't have any kind of salads.
It's Darlene Early, the G.A.O. General administration officer.
I need to do the interview and paperwork... for your transfer to Folsom.
So you prefer your own company?
Most of the time.
I am supposed to recommend whether or not... you seem to require a detailed psychiatric evaluation.
Other than the incident in the mess hall...
That wasn't me.
So you deny any responsibility?
Yeah, I deny it.
This has no bearing in your transfer to Folsom.
You know, this whole thing... this whole thing is about people bein' scared.
Someday, ever fighter loses.
Sooner or later, somebody comes along... and they got your ticket.
Too old, just wasn't your day, whatever the reason is.
In the end, everybody gets beaten.
It's shit, but I can handle it.
Just keep your goddamn nose clean.
You already got enough problems.
And since they stripped you of your title... they're having this elimination tournament... to figure out a new champ.
Everybody thinks Briscoe's a lock to win it.
Word is, Montel's fighting Jimmy Stubbs in July.
Jimmy Stubbs's a bum.
Fuck the fans.
I get outta here, I'll get 'em back.
The fans pay your bills, and don't you ever forget it.
He's in another world:
Then all of a sudden... he's right there with you, like everything's normal.
A lot of rumors in prison, you know?
Ah, probably deserved it anyway.
We hear you don't want to associate with anybody here.
Maybe you got way too much attitude, man.
You handling' that?
Is any of this covered... by the $2 million I already paid you?
Now, in California, that means... you're eligible for parole in four years.
What you need to focus on... is if you become a model prisoner... exhibit special circumstances... you could be considered for a work furlough... as soon as eighteen months to two years.
So it don't matter whether I did it or not?
The bottom line... we need to get your black ass outta here... and back in the ring.
Challenger Monroe Hutchen's undefeated... takin' on state champ Butch Davis... in what, so far, has been a nearly even fight,
It's all Monroe, it's all Monroe!
Davis is down, and this fight is over!
Your attorneys have come to me and asked me... to handle your response to the plaintiff's filing,
As you know, you are now facing a separate civil suit... that may well go to trial... over the criminal charges you've been convicted of.
What happened next is in question.
Miss Rawlins effectively convinced... the criminal trial jury that she believed that... you could break her in two with one arm.
You know anything about that?
That wasn't par of your testimony.
A lawyer said don't sound like I'm calling her a ho.
The prosecution pegged you as a bully.
And she could explain it away easily enough by saying... that you mistook what were in fact her cries for help... for she was just in pain.
I heard pain before, and... ha ha ha... believe me, she wasn't in no pain.
And then when he finished, he just put back on his pants... and went back out into the party... and left me alone.
I'm a gift.
He kind of run things for El Faziz Assassins.
I'm looking for Saladin.
Pleased to meet a man of your great accomplishments.
There's strength in unity, brother.
In here we need cooperation and understanding.
We are at times discriminated against... even within these walls.
Brother, if you don't join with us... you'll be destroying the unity we create.
Warden wants to see you.
That's quite a show you put on there.
Three incidents already, one a near riot... one an assault and now a physical confrontation... that has sent five men to the hospital... for medical treatment.
The whole thing is, they got to respect you... or you nothin'.
I'm trying to explain to him how to survive.
I don't think there are too many inmates here... who could challenge you physically, Mr. Chambers.
You really don't understand.
My whole life, I got a problem, I take care of it with these.
People love a guy who can fight.
Money, pussy, kiss your ass, put you on TV... put your picture in papers, magazines... anything I want, because people love a guy who can fight... and don't take shit.
On the night of December 1, 1990... you beat a man to death with your bare fists... which because of your profession... and your training are considered... to be lethal weapons in the state of California,
You've been found guilty by a jury of your peers... and you are sentenced to life imprisonment... without the possibility of parole,
Long prize, Monroe kicks his ass... we can make a lot of money here.
Mr. Ripstein wants to see the Iceman... fight a prisoner we got in here.
His name is Monroe Hutchen.
Now...about Monroe Hutchen.
The warden thinks it's time... to give him a chance to rehabilitate himself... by socializing with the other prisoners.
Free at last, free at last.
You get to stay home with us.
From George Chambers, the Iceman.
His boy came up to me and said... that if I fight some punk in here... he could maybe get me out quick.
If Mendy Ripstein says it, then it's the real deal.
If it's on the real, I'll whip on this punk's ass... and be out of here.
Even if he was something, he's been in here for ten years.
Yes, I want you to fight him,
In the cage, no gloves, bare-fisted, to the finish,
And I think he can't wait.
What's in it for me?
Mr. Ripstein uses his influence... you stay out of solitar... get the privileges you been missing.
You in here, too.
I got a sister, she got three kids... no job, no skills, no husband.
You're gonna get thirty percent of everything we win.
You wanted to see the Iceman?
Mr. Ripstein thanks you for bringing him... to this neutral location.
You have to understand... that Mr. Ripstein is a great boxing enthusiast... a great student of the art... a great historian of the prize ring.
Mr. Ripstein believes the truest... purest expression of the sport... was the bare-knuckle fights of the Nineteenth Century... the Queensbury rules.
I got your word on this?
You better get ready to fight.
The fight is six weeks from tomorrow night.
Mr. Ripstein has gone through a lot of trouble... putting them together.
Mr. Mercker can judge fouls from outside the cage.
Yeah, I know, but it'll make for a dull fight.
I mean, bare knuckles, nobody throws a lot.
Be a lot more hitting with gloves.
First, there's a smile, then comes a cheap shot, huh?
I guess nobody's dumb enough to fall for that twice, huh?
You got that right, Mr. Iceman.
You believe that, you must believe in the tooth fair.
Nobody's backing up.
Good evening, I'm Maureen O'Boyle,
Tonight on CNO X's "The inside Story"... we'll be talking with Tawnee Rawlins... in an exclusive interview... that will be her first public statement... since the sensational trial and conviction... of George "Iceman" Chambers... former heavyweight champion of the world.
I was scared.
I didn't want to be there anymore.
This whole thing is just such a mess.
I've been out of work... since this whole thing happened... and I had to have lots of doctors and lawyers... and I got stacks of mail from people... saying that they hate me... because I took away their heavyweight champ... and that I'm a gold digger and all that... but I say walk a mile in my shoes.
I did not want to cause him any harm... but he wouldn't listen to me, and he wouldn't stop.
These dumb shits been watching too many old prison movies.
Hey, Iceman!
Then you show up actin' like you're the God... and we're the sod,
Well, hey, man, ever dog in here... wanted to see you get your ass kicked,
Kick your ass, motherfucker!
He cancelled the fight,
Jesus fuckin' Christ, this fuckin' state.
Who the fuck does this fuckin' warden... fuckin' think he is?
Doesn't anybody know how to do business in this fuckin' state?
Yes, sir, Mr. Ripstein.
However, any attempt to have me reinstate the fight... between Mr. Chambers and Monroe Hutchen will be futile.
This is a story that takes place in about... it must've been the middle 1950s.
I was second in charge of certain operations... second to a Mr. Meyer Lansky.
I had to report this to Mr. Lansky.
He could choose to be killed, or he could choose to have... a great deal of money deposited in his bank account.
He hit his ignition and his car exploded like a fireball.
You're gonna stand there and let this hoodlum threaten me?
Well, sir, I don't much want my car to blow up.
We could talk about the money... when you come back from your vacation.
I understand you're leaving tomorrow?
All of us, we hope you and your family... have a very pleasant time.
We need the Iceman to go for it.
-He had to fight for that one.
With Mendy, it's always about the money.
You guys are way off Mendy's radar on this deal... and I don't want to mess it up for him.
Mendy wants a straight fight to the finish, and that's it.
Just enough to slow him down, fuck him up.
Now, he'll still fight, but he won't be the same.
You do that, I'm gonna break you up into pieces.
We got a lot of money on this table.
I may not be a real good guy... but I ain't no chickenshit, either.
Take him down.
We see Iceman all beat to shit.
In twenty minutes, we star to loosen up, OK?
Hey, you get sloppy, that's when mistakes happen.
All right, cell blocks A, B, C, and D... if all y'all are ready over there... let's star movin' em in on fifteen-minute intervals.
And now, Sweetwater's the Gat Boyz... will sing the national anthem!
Good evening, honored guests, scumbags, and Mr. Mercker... the time is now!
We got a first here, my friends... courtesy of a great man, whose name I cannot say.
Fight fans all over the world are gonna be wishin'... they's in the bottom of the barrel with us... wishin' Sweetwater Prison was their home tonight!
Now pay close attention... 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.
There's only one thing I got to say... put his ass between his shoulders!
Now, don't let your passion for the great Monroe... interfere with good judgment, and don't do nothin' stupid!
That'll forfeit all the money... that you guys bet at those big odds.
And welcome to our amigos from Las Vegas... here to witness this contest and report it... to various cities all around our great country,
Whole lotta bookmakers out there want to know... what's comin' down.
He brought honor to our house of pain... but I will call a neutral fight.
And here we go, baby.
They move to the center of the ring... feelin' each other out,
Monroe's backpedaling, circling,
Monroe is fast, but the Iceman is much stronger,
Monroe misses, The Iceman comes back... with a right-left to the head!
Nice overhand right by Monroe!
Iceman's not hurt, but he ties Monroe up in a clinch!
And we now know why he's the heavyweight champion... of the world.
Looks like he will continue,
Round Two!
The Iceman misses... and Monroe lands an overhand right!
Ooh, what a right hand by the Iceman!
Another right to the head, Monroe misses... and pays for it dearly to the body... and he reels back from the punishment... given to him by the Iceman,
Another one to the body, and it doesn't look good... for Sweetwater's own favorite son,
Oh, that Iceman is one cocky son of a bitch,
They come out, and it seems like the Iceman... is just trin' to find that one big shot... that'll put Monroe on his ass... and give him a one-way ticket to Bootyville.
Iceman has a look of determination in his eye... but like I said before, brother scumbags... he's lookin' for that big punch to end it all for Monroe,
The Iceman is staggering, and he's hurt!
The Iceman is down... for the first time in his career!
And the Iceman is up, He's staggering' around,
I got a lotta damn money riding' on this!
Monroe has definitely turned this fight around,
What goes on in the mind of George "Iceman" Chambers... at this moment is anybody's guess,
Monroe hits him with a right hand, left hand... and another right hand... and the Iceman is forced to clinch!
Monroe switches to southpaw!
Oh, my god, what a fight!
And I am so happy... that it's happenin' right here at Sweetwater Prison,
Two guys fighting' to the finish... but just one guy wins because he's the better man... and that's what the goddamn sport is about.
Mendy Ripstein died 3 weeks after the big fight,
He kept his word, Monroe got his money... and the Iceman got out on special parole,
I can personally thank Mr. Ripstein... for another thing,
I read in the sports page that Iceman and his manager... both denied the fight with Monroe ever happened... and the story about him losing was only a big rumor... a fairy tale,
Our panel of experts... have the fight even at two rounds apiece,
Both fighters fighting... for the heavyweight championship of the world... the greatest title in all of sports,
One thing I can tell you for sure... life in prison hasn't changed the Iceman's fighting style,
Both fighters feeling each other out now,
A left hook, and down goes Briscoe!
- Who's next?
- No, man.
- You're all right.
Logan, what d'you say, pal?
- Rack 'em.
He's gonna run it now.
You gotta admit, that was pretty cool.
You're on.
Go wash your hands.
- I was being serious.
I'm OK.
I could have killed you over a stupid game of pool.
Back in the day, they'd give you 10 cent a can. 10 cent!
Nowadays, you'd be lucky if you get 10 cent a pound.
They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon.
Then she escaped.
In a future not far from now, in a broken world, she is haunted by her past.
That Manticore creep could've been onto something and didn't know it.
Sorry I painted over your virus papers, Max.
fx-1 times delta x is approximate to delta q.
So the virus bitch is going down?
Could be.
You know, I never would've caught this if you hadn't painted over my papers.
You gotta blaze?
Why are you shaking your head.
Are my calculations wrong?
Well, they're not so much wrong as not right.
- Which part?
- Luring the virus into a protein dead end.
You ask me, 20 large is still a small price to pay for you and Logan to get together.
I just wanna know I'm not gonna kill the guy if, say, I touch his hand by accident.
Or if, say, you spend a long weekend making hot monkey love to the man... by accident.
Does he know about the man with the cure?
I'm gonna try to get the cash first.
I don't wanna have to owe him if this falls through.
Where you gonna get the money?
- I'm gonna sell my soul.
- And why do you ask?
- Is that the one where Captain Kirk dies?
Max, are you asking me to steal something with you?
- Did I mention your take was 20 grand?
- Well, rinse out the sink.
You both are gonna eat this meat loaf, and that is final.
Does this qualify as stealing from a bad guy, or do you have a new handy excuse for swiping something that doesn't belong to you?
Check and see if the guards are still there.
- Donate it to charity.
New DNA markers for current boyfriend.
The immunoglobulin's gonna take a lap through your system.
Those are antibodies, completely encasing the virus nuclei and protein coating.
- So it's working?
They're eating through the protein coating.
- How long until the coating is history?
Got a minute?
Let me ask you a... hypothetical question.
Is there such a thing?
That's where the supposing part comes in.
So we can touch... and nothing will happen?
- Exactly.
It'll have to be long enough.
- We've got 10 hours.
- Evidently.
We've been waiting for the right time.
Here it is.
What news?
So how long were you and Alec stuck in the closet?
He's a yapper.
Yeah, stuck in a closet with Alec - you're pretty much describing my worst nightmare.
Better.
- Logan and Max.
- Max and Logan.
Wonder what they're doing right now.
You had it all dialled in when Max was at Manticore, presumed dead.
You and Logan, doing your hero thing, spending hours in his fancy apartment, all tuned up about the ways of the world.
He never believed she was dead.
And when she came back, he was the happiest I've ever seen him.
Yeah, until the virus thing.
Even with the virus, they never gave up on each other.
And no matter how I feel about it, I have to respect that.
The two of them will never work out together.
We're living on borrowed time.
If you don't put your heart out on the line, you're never really living at all.
If I loved someone, I'd tell her.
And if I wanted someone, then I would let her know, straight up.
"Could cause harmful health risk."
Gossamer.
Look, if this thing is hurting people, then...
I got this from an old guy on the waterfront who specialises in pre-Pulse small batch, of all things.
Are you sure he's dangerous?
- That's a lot of ground to cover.
- That's an idea.
I'll talk to Matt Sung, see if there are other reports about this thing, figure out its MO.
We've only got eight hours and 53 minutes.
- I always feel like I'm kissing you goodbye.
X4 gone rogue, give Gossamer one of his T-shirts, let him smell it - wouldn't stop till the kid was found.
- What'd he do once he found him?
- It's not like I had anything better to do.
- Sorry this interrupts your evening.
The guy that Joshua saw grabbed, Hal Johnson, had also just been to the dentist.
Gossamer going down?
Eight hours to be with the girl of my dreams, and I'm at the dentist's office.
You keep checking the time.
Hey, this is Alec's cellphone.
Check this place out.
- Alec, can you get out?
Yeah, I thought I'd hang around cos it's so comfy.
- I don't wanna die!
We still have the Nomlies, and Manticore, and all fate's against us.
Gossamer!
That oughta hold him for a while.
Just give me a minute.
You all right?
So what is he, anyway?
Well, like I already explained to the other fellas, he's... a Tasmanian ant-eating aardvark.
Smells like silicone.
I came home and sat on my sofa and I didn't get up again for days.
Here you go.
Quality not quantity, Max.
Greetings, y'all y'all.
Big news, my brothers.
You're lookin' at the new reporter for America's fastest-growing magazine.
- The New World Weekly?
I dropped my résumé off last month, and they finally called.
Said they'd give a hungry young newshound a chance.
What'll you be doin' for 'em?
I'll hunt down mutants and immortalise their horrible faces for tabloid posterity.
Wait till I get my first exclusive.
In the meantime, everybody, drinks on me at Crash.
- This is not good.
- I'm as worried about exposure as you are.
I'd believe that if you covered your bar code better.
Look, I seriously doubt White and his merry band of transgenic-hunters get their tips from New World Weekly- and it's Sketchy we're talkin' about.
What are the chances he finds a Manticore alum stupid enough to let him snap a shot?
You were saying?
I've tried to reach you, but your sister said...
- What?
- I found Ray.
- Is he with you?
- No, but I know where my husband took him.
But you have to promise me that you're not going to do anything until I get there.
I don't have to tell you how dangerous the people who took your son are.
- Tell me where you are.
- Even the policeman I talked to...
- Wendy, where are you?
You shouldn't have come here.
I want my son.
Who are you people?
- What are you doing to him?
- That is not your concern.
We've protected ourselves for thousands of years.
And you should have left well enough alone.
- Please.
They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon.
Then she escaped.
In a future not far from now, in a broken world, she is haunted by her past.
She called from a town called Willoughby, which is located three hours south of here.
Why is Wendy trying to track down Ray by herself?
I mean, she knows how psycho White and his cult pals are.
I can't tell you how many times I've tried to tell her that.
She's called more than once with what turned out to be bogus leads.
- Think this might be another dead end?
- Did occur to me, until I heard someone bust in and the line went dead.
Yeah, here we go.
- Max is sick again?
I think it's cholera.
- Or diphtheria.
- Aw, or maybe bubonic plague.
I hear that's goin' around.
- Is that goin' to Sector Three?
Maybe I'll get lucky and snap a shot.
What do you think?
He'll slog around, come back empty-handed, tired and smelling like garbage.
- Phone number's listed to this hotel.
- Which room did she call from?
- Records didn't break it down that far.
- Well, let's go check it out.
Wendy had the feeling someone was onto her.
We don't wanna tip the wrong person off.
Well, that kinda makes things tough.
Watch and learn.
Uh, we're here with the Conner party.
- Conner party?
- Hunting weekend.
Booked two rooms.
No, sorry, is it under another name?
- Maybe if I take a look it'll jog my memory.
- It's OK, we've a couple of vacancies.
Oh, great.
Well, then, we'll take a room.
OK, well, then just fill that out.
- I hate it when it's on the tip of your tongue...
Well, pretty quiet week.
So nobody, all week?
That's, uh... that's what it says.
- Here you go.
Thanks.
Have a nice stay.
I said "watch and learn", not "tip the guy off".
I was just trying to make sure.
A new phone jack.
Someone went out of their way to make it look like nothin' happened.
Ten bucks for a soda?
They'll gouge you any way they can.
No honour in a broken world.
Oh, look what I found.
- Best place to keep film till you develop it.
- Think it's Wendy's?
- Let's find out.
Freeze!
What the hell are you doin' here?
There it is!
Subject is headed for daylight.
- Get these people outta here.
Throw a sheet over its ugly head.
Get it to HQ ASAP.
Just takes a few minutes and the photos, they come out right there.
Good afternoon.
Well, you enjoy your stay.
- What's that?
- Dunno.
School uniforms.
Could be a prep school nearby.
That's Ray.
White must have stashed him here.
Right, well, I took a wrong turn.
- I gave him bad directions.
- She had the map.
Forgot one.
I get the feeling this isn't your average boarding school for rich kids with disciplinary problems.
Think it's the cult's version of Manticore?
If so, Willoughby's cult central, and we don't know who's involved - sheriff, hotel clerk...
- Let's get Wendy and Ray and get outta here.
It was probably designed to be a worker-drone - good for hauling equipment, digging foxholes, that kind of thing.
On another matter, sir, we may have a situation.
The team came across a kid in the sewers, before the damn thing broke for the street.
He had a camera.
He may have gotten off a couple of shots.
Terrific.
White.
Yes, sir.
Of course, but can it wait till tomorrow?
That was the director.
He wants to meet to talk about today's little snafu.
I do not want to have to tell him that on top of everything else, we have a kid runnin' around with photographs.
We do have a lead.
One of the men remembers that he was wearing a backpack with a company logo.
Be lucky if I get out of town before rush hour.
- And you smell like it, too.
Well, why don't you take a load off and tell us all about it?
You should have seen him, dude.
You're gonna see it as soon as I get the film developed.
I'm gonna take this to the paper right after lunch.
Poor little white boy.
He was excited about that story, too.
I did it for Max.
But you're welcome.
He posed a danger to the public, sir.
- Perhaps I shoulda waited until it ate a child.
- You are out of line, Agent White.
With respect, what's out of line is the way this entire operation is being handled.
- We're understaffed and underfunded.
- Your funding is off the books.
We can't risk diverting any more without raising eyebrows.
Well, I thought that my job was to capture transgenics, not to cover somebody's ass.
If it got out that billions of tax dollars were diverted to a secret government programme to build transgenic soldiers - well, that would be bad enough.
But if it got out that millions more were being diverted to catch the damned things because they got away, it would be a disaster.
Damn it, Ames, it could bring down the Committee itself.
Catch 'em, kill 'em, let 'em skulk around in the sewer to their heart's content.
You just keep them off the nightly news.
Well, I can't, you know.
You know that parents aren't allowed to be there until it's finished.
And I'll see you soon.
I love you too.
- Ready?
- Watch and learn.
- Can I help you?
- I must've taken a wrong turn somewhere.
I'm looking for, uh, County Road 4.
- Maybe I should write this down.
- Uh, that's all right.
Damn it.
Just passin' through, huh?
I see.
We had an incident involving one of the transgenics.
She was cut with the kariff.
It should take effect on her soon.
I asked for the heart with the dagger through it.
What are you doing with Ray?
Cos I left my copy of Wacky Cult Rituals for Dummies at home.
Ray is proving himself.
Oh, really?
Well, I'd like to see you prove yourself.
I have.
You shouldn't have interfered.
Sorry I spoiled the party.
Special Agent Otto Gottlieb, NSA.
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- You run this place?
- Yes, as best I can, sir.
- He had a camera.
Glad I could help.
- Well, maybe you left the lens cap on.
- Or loaded the film in backwards.
These things happen, Sketch.
A shot of a guy in a Hallowe'en mask and say that there's monsters on the loose.
Sketch, they make this stuff up.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
- I'm a bike messenger.
- We're all bike messengers.
Yeah, but with you and Max and OC, it's not all you are.
If the mutant stories were true, then life would be more interesting, and as a reporter bringing that story to the world, then I would be more interesting.
But I am what I am - a bike messenger.
- It's not true, Sketchy.
- Well, it feels true.
Tell me again how that had to be done.
Had to be done.
Calvin Theodore, you're coming with us.
I'm interested in what you were doin' up at the school.
This is about the boy, isn't it?
The boy in the picture.
- You got it all wrong.
Look, I make it my business to take care of that school and everybody in it.
- What are you lookin' at, you little freak?
- How do you feel?
- What do you care?
It should have started by now.
If he's sick, you should get a doctor.
If he's not meant to survive, no one can help him.
It's gettin' hot in here.
Can you turn down the heat?
- It's begun.
- What's begun?
That's why I'm here - to watch.
Watch what?
Watch you die.
I said I was sorry about the shoes.
- What were you doing down in that sewer?
Some loser in a Hallowe'en mask.
What paper do you work for?
- New World Weekly.
- It's a tabloid.
Yeah, a picture of a weather balloon and the aliens are coming.
Look, dude, I'll totally score you a new pair of shoes.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Haven't you ever noticed anything strange?
Maybe.
Then hear me out.
There's something in the blood.
- I'm gonna die anyway.
Please.
I didn't know you would be here.
I'm honoured.
- How is he?
He's my only son.
This is how it's always been for us.
You said you had some business with 452.
I'll call you if there's any change.
Please.
Stop!
I said "stop".
You were just pretending to be sick.
- Want me to put you down?
Not even if I do this?
Made you look.
Sweet dreams, bitch.
Not another step.
Put him down.
Drop your gun.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
Max, hurry!
Well, I expect the long arm of the law is giving you a sound and deserved thrashing.
Some government suits grabbed me up.
- Yeah, a guy in a mask.
- Use your head, dude.
Like they need to cover up the existence of guys in costumes.
Course, the important question is, who gets to tell Max?
How is that possible?
Sandeman.
His work at Manticore must have progressed further than we'd thought.
We need to find out if the others are immune as well.
I'll deal with the other transgenics, and I'll deal with 452.
- But I have to find out what happened to Ray.
- Possible, but doubtful.
I need to know.
- I have to be sure.
- You do whatever you have to do.
You just find out what the hell is going on.
This could jeopardise everything we've worked towards.
Some kind of pathogen or viral agent he's never seen before.
Those snakes must be carriers, hosts for whatever bug it is.
Well, whatever it is, kid's immune system kicked in with the right antibodies.
If he didn't, he wasn't one of them.
Congratulations.
Think if I concentrated I could make stuff fly around the room?
I wouldn't count on it.
My guess would be that the kid that went all poltergeist on you was part of some kind of special breeding line.
Makes you wonder what other tricks they have up their sleeves.
Poor kid.
Not exactly the storybook ending we were hoping for.
At least we got him away from those people.
That's what Wendy wanted.
Made arrangements to get her and Ray on a plane, as far away from White as I can.
Did I pass?
Am I strong?
"Depress tab to activate, then immediately leave area."
That's the plan.
- That was close.
- Thanks for bringing the bombs.
Yeah, I'll stay right here with my little fella.
- Trying to piece a couple of things together.
I saw it when they saluted their holy snake god, or whatever it was.
You know what?
- Long time no see.
- I guess so.
I was made in a lab.
I spent my formative years learning the fine art of assassination.
There are guys out there looking to kill me, and someday they'll probably succeed.
Right, because the last time I let go, someone got caught in the crossfire and died.
Beat it.
Can I get another beer?
So, what'd you do now?
Why am I always the bad guy with you, Max?
What is that supposed to mean?
You think your only problem is an engineered virus that'll kill Logan if you touch him?
- Yeah, that takes the front seat.
- When will you see that?
- Me and Logan are none of your business.
- What was that all about?
You OK?
How's he doing?
Don't let him die, please.
From what I can tell, the virus is a mutated strain of a bio-warfare agent called Zycinor.
There's no known cure.
Manticore made us immune to a bunch of germ-warfare bugs.
I'm pretty sure this is one of them.
- You'd reinfect him.
They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon.
So, I hear you're feeling better.
I'm working hard, doing what the men tell me.
- You didn't tell anybody about that, did you?
Sorry I had to do that to you, but it was the only way.
Remember, though, that is between you and me.
To do this, your friend better get here soon.
Is there anybody else you can get?
Is someone there?
Are you hurt?
No, I'm not hurt.
- Oh, from where?
- In France.
- It's nice to meet you, Joshua.
Did you find someone?
Be right back.
Bring 'em in.
The antibodies in your friend's blood are neutralising the virus.
- Not ever again.
- You're just saying that cos you're upset.
No, this has to stop.
Isn't here, doesn't call, thinks only of himself, always hurts the one...
Is that him?
If you're serious about this, you owe him an explanation.
- Hi, stranger.
- We need to talk.
I pulled out an old board I had and put up all the doodlings I made at the bar the other night.
It's kind of my wide-screen version, you know?
I can't do this any more.
Look, I'm fine.
Everything turned out OK.
Do I get a vote?
It is my life on the line.
So what, you end up dead and I get to spend the rest of my life knowing it's my fault?
I've been where you are, remember?
Thinking it was all too hard.
But I realised being away from you... was worse.
- What should I tell the Conclave?
It's possible that Sandeman made the Manticore transgenics immune.
It's funny, we were walking past and Billie veered up your steps again.
She's usually a really good judge of character.
I hope you don't think I'm being forward, but I wanted to invite you to dinner.
- You like macaroni and cheese?
- It's my favourite.
- I'll see you around seven, OK?
- Whatever.
Hummer, the bartender from last night, saw him get pinched right outside of here.
Kind of makes you wonder what he did, huh?
Now, you know you gotta come correct on this.
Bad for Alec, bad for you, bad for Joshua, bad for everybody.
Not like saving his butt isn't already my full-time job.
Thanks for the beer.
Pleasure.
- I'm telling you...
- Don't tell me anything.
I'm sorry I let you out of Manticore and inflicted you on the world.
- Max, I swear, I'm innocent.
You think I could murder someone in cold blood?
Yes, I think you could.
The guy's teeth were pulled from his head, for God's sake.
- Ben, why are you doing this?
- You know why.
Come on, Max.
Time's up.
Max, what made you think I didn't do it?
I'm just curious.
I can hardly stand going to the dentist.
- Shut up, OK?
- Why are you taking this so personally?
- Because it was Ben.
- Ben, my Manticore twin Ben?
One more word and I shove you off this ledge.
This was your plan?
Jump!
I should've stayed where I was and taken my chances.
Come on!
So what's the problem?
- I'm not gonna see him any more.
- Any more this week?
Yeah, sure.
When we were kids back at Manticore, he always wanted answers for everything.
Why we were there, what was outside.
So he would make up these fantastic stories to explain things.
Like we weren't all alone.
After we escaped, there were too many things in this world he didn't have answers for.
Hey, you OK?
I'm fine.
Max, what is it?
We were in the woods.
He was hurt, and Manticore was closing in on us.
- He didn't wanna go back there.
I killed him.
Max, I'm sorry.
There was an outbreak of measles after the Pulse hit.
I can hear it in their voices.
I guess it's cos I can't do everything they do.
- I know, but...
- You should do that.
Maybe you could come with me.
Maybe.
It's beautiful, Joshua.
- Thank you.
Lay low until we get this whole mistaken-identity thing sorted out.
He'll love it.
Thanks for saving my butt - again.
Maybe.
Or, you know, maybe it's because I'm such a pain in the ass sometimes.
- Be careful.
- Always.
Hey, hey, roomie.
It turns out my dead twin brother was a psycho killer.
Are we livin' in the Dark Ages?
A girl who lives down the street.
I'm tired of laying low, Alec.
Mule?
You see that fence?
Thank you... for everything.
Freeze!
Alec, the boob tube is too loud.
- Tricks and treats.
- Welcome to the world of attention deficit.
This is a Channel Three news break.
A hoverdrone recorded this shocking footage.
He's believed to have escaped from a covert government project known as Manticore.
Authorities deny all knowledge of Manticore...
That's the thing I saw in the sewer last week.
It's me, Annie.
- What's wrong?
- The news...
- What news?
- When?
- Today.
Goodbye, Annie.
You can see it right there, the bar code.
Unconfirmed reports suggest these tattoos were used to keep track of the various soldiers involved in the programme.
The mutant's body was rushed away concerns about a potential biohazard.
- Thanks for ringing' back.
I know you're sad, but you did the right thing.
Remember we talked about how we're not like other people and we need to stick together?
Right now that's more important than ever.
Father gave it to me.
- Hi there.
Maybe I ought to do an Eyes Only hack, huh?
- I could keep you here all night.
- Come on, Logan.
- At least till I drop dead.
I mean, if I've got it wrong, just say so.
Sit down.
So... you got any deep thoughts you want to share?
Love sucks.
You're the medical examiner?
Mr. Rose?
I'm sorry, Mr. Rose but I cannot state conclusively that the cause of death was natural.
Your daughter, she...
Excuse me, Father?
Father Moore.
You'll have to come with me.
- They're not talking to the police.
We're going after a holy man here.
Ethan Thomas.
Have you seen the news about this priest?
I heard something about an exorcism gone bad, but I don't know the details.
The DA charged him with negligent homicide.
They offered a very reasonable plea bargain, but the priest turned it down.
They think you're smart and convincing.
They want you to ask the priest to reconsider.
Erin, the Van Hopper case got you back on the fast track.
The case is yours.
And just how high do I get to rise this time?
I've been junior partner for too long now, Karl.
If the priest won't and this goes to trial the archdiocese feels he could be an embarrassment.
His tab.
- Why did they choose you?
If you're not sure, then you are one.
Do you understand how long they can put you away?
It's been explained to me.
What would your strategy be to defend me against such a formidable man?
What's your main concern, other than staying out of jail?
What I care about is telling Emily Rose's story.
I want people to hear what only I can tell.
If I let you defend me will you promise to let me testify and tell the truth about what happened?
Not so strange.
My mother, she raised me alone.
That was Emily's dream, to be a teacher.
That's why she went away to the university.
A lot of cats live here.
Emily always brought them home.
Ever since she was a little girl, she couldn't leave a stray abandoned.
Before these troubles began was Emily a happy girl?
Before she went away to university my Emily was so very happy.
Mama.
You'll be leaving us.
It's okay.
I'm gonna show this to your father.
So the judge thinks we should offer a new plea agreement.
She feels the community might be better served without this trial.
Your priest broke the law and a young girl is dead.
Father Moore has made it clear there will be no plea agreement.
He will not lie or admit to something he is not guilty of.
Good.
So do I.
We will prove that the victim's condition rendered her physically and psychologically incapable of caring for herself.
Her care was then wholly entrusted to that man, the defendant, Father Richard Moore.
She became his responsibility and he betrayed that responsibility by persuading her to abandon her medical treatment in favor of religious treatment:
A ritual exorcism, performed by the defendant allegedly to cure the victim by ridding her of demonic forces.
We will demonstrate that this course of action directly resulted in the victim's death.
I'm here on behalf of someone who can't sit at a table and look at you every day and gain your sympathy someone who can't take the stand to testify and tell you what happened in her own words.
This is what she looked like before the defendant began his religious treatment.
This is a photograph taken of her on the day that she died.
I stand here for Emily Rose who died horribly at age 19.
And as she was when Father Richard Moore was finished with her and left her to die.
That was already my plan.
How did she feel about going to school?
She didn't want her mother to know this because her mother did not approve of dancing and had warned her about the boys at school.
Did Emily communicate with you again last fall after you received the letter?
Actually, it was her mother.
She telephoned me waking me out of a deep sleep at 4 in the morning.
She asked me to call Emily at a payphone on the university campus.
When Emily answered, she was quite hysterical.
She said that she was alone that weekend.
She had awakened... ... and thought she smelled something burning.
There was no alarm, but she got up... ... afraid there was a fire.
But we ran tests and found no trace of drugs in her system.
And the more she explained the incident to me the more I began to suspect something else.
Epilepsy results from uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain.
In a severe, or grand mal, seizure... ... a person may lose consciousness for several minutes... ... and suffer involuntary contractions of all the muscles of the body.
Is it possible for a person suffering such a seizure... ... to have hallucinations or perceive the things that Emily described?
But Emily failed to keep her follow-up appointments with me.
She give any reason for discontinuing these appointments?
Yes, she told me she was convinced that her condition was a spiritual one.
It was the conviction of her priest, she said, and she shared his beliefs.
After the end of October did you ask Emily why she had stopped filling her Gambutrol prescriptions?
And what, in your medical opinion was the result of Father Moore's suggestion?
I believe Father Moore's suggestion killed her.
You said you observed a possible epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.
Doesn't this imply what you observed may not have been an epileptic focus?
Yes, that's also possible.
When Emily saw objects move on their own and felt an invisible presence on top of her was she experiencing symptoms typical of epilepsy?
Not typical, no.
- Yes, I would say that's correct.
But isn't psychosis an entirely different medical condition from epilepsy?
Dark, powerful forces.
Father, you don't have to worry about me.
Your involvement in this trial might just open you up to their attacks.
Look, Father, I appreciate your concern but you need to be worried about yourself.
Ethan Thomas is using the medical aspects of this case as ammunition and I have to be prepared for his attacks, so with what little time we have, I think we need to focus on your defense.
I stayed until the end.
So much of what we shared was like a nightmare but I wouldn't give up a single minute I spent with her.
Sources close to the investigation say that Van Hopper... ... who was acquitted of murder charges in April... ... may have known both of the victims.
Why did her body shut down?
The autopsy found that it was a cumulative effect from numerous physical traumas exacerbated by malnutrition which severely inhibited her ability to recuperate from those traumas.
In other words, her starving body had little or no means to recover from the injuries it was sustaining, and so it eventually just gave out.
Upon review of her complete medical file I concluded that Emily's epilepsy had evolved into a condition known as psychotic epileptic disorder.
Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol could've controlled Emily's condition.
It would've controlled her seizures which were the root cause of her psychosis.
You assume that Gambutrol would've helped her, but you don't know.
Doctor, is "psychotic epileptic disorder" a common medical term or did you just make it up?
Absolutely.
Nothing further.
The witness may step down.
The photograph is entered into evidence.
We are recessed until tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp at which time the defense will give its opening statement and call its first witness.
I'm sorry I was late.
- No, I didn't sleep either.
What are you talking about?
Don't let them.
Care of the city's main branch and the university library I bring you another dozen fun-filled books about the demonic and the mentally deranged.
They burned women at the stake during witch hunts for being possessed.
This book I'm reading, it's by an anthropologist.
No, the archdiocese won't let us do that.
They wanna limit the Church's exposure to Father Moore.
I've got three articles by the anthropologist who wrote this book.
She approaches the subject of possession from a scientific perspective and doesn't try to debunk it.
Keep looking for a medical expert to refute Dr. Briggs.
But send the case file to this Dr. Sadira Adani.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury as you know by now, my name is Erin Bruner and I represent the defendant, Richard Moore.
Mr. Thomas has contended that Emily Rose suffered from a serious medical condition that required medical treatment, nothing more.
He has asserted that any attempt by my client to help Emily by anything other than medical means was not only inappropriate, but criminally negligent.
I'm now gonna ask that you keep an open mind to what our evidence and testimony will show.
Medical treatment was not the answer for Emily because she simply did not suffer from a medical condition.
She was neither epileptic nor psychotic.
And we will show that despite his greatest efforts and his sincere love for Emily there was nothing he could've done to prevent the death of Emily Rose.
The forces that were in control of her.
That were inside her.
I called her father, and he told me to bring Emily home.
Jason and I put Emily to bed... ... hoping she would sleep.
Eventually, when she didn't get better, we called our priest, Father Moore.
Sir, if you saw someone eating insects on a street corner, would you say that that person is mentally ill?
It just didn't feel that way to me or to Father Moore.
Thank you.
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.
I am currently a professor of anthropology and psychiatry at Northwestern University.
And what is your specific area of expertise?
I study the spiritual experiences of people in various cultures and the physiological and psychological changes they undergo during these experiences.
Would it be accurate to say that you specialize in the study of possession?
Why do you think Emily was invaded?
Why did this possession happen to her?
Based on my study of the case file I believe that Emily Rose was a hypersensitive.
A person with an unusual connection to what Carlos Castaneda called "the separate reality."
Hypersensitives are born different from everyone else.
They can have visions of the future, or see the dead and sometimes be uniquely susceptible to invasion by an entity that is alien to them.
We've heard a great deal of testimony in support of a medical explanation for Emily's condition.
Now we have a witness who has spent her career studying the defense's alternative explanation.
Please explain.
The exorcism ritual results in a specific brain activity that cuts the person off from the possession experience.
Thank you, doctor.
I'm looking at a list of your published articles, doctor.
You've been quite busy and prolific.
So based on your time spent with Holy Roller snake-handlers voodoo priestesses and Indians tripping on peyote buds based on observing these bizarre individuals you've concluded that possession is a basic, typical human experience?
I must say, counselor that's quite a laundry list of disdain and one that thoroughly mischaracterizes my research.
No, I don't think possession is a typical experience.
But I am convinced that it is a scientifically verified culturally universal one.
Have you ever used Gambutrol in your studies to test your theory about its effect on the possession experience?
So this notion of Gambutrol locking someone in a possessed state the key to your assertion that her medical treatment harmed Emily this would be your own pet theory, correct?
No further questions.
I've got a doctor who wants to testify.
He's an eyewitness, Erin.
Dr. Graham Cartwright, Department of Abnormal Psychiatry at St. Mary's Hospital.
He asked that I keep his involvement confidential and I said I would.
- May I sit?
I had hoped Father Moore wouldn't need me but I don't wanna see him put away.
What kind of help, doctor?
He wanted a medical perspective from a psychiatrist you know, one that he knew, trusted to observe Emily's physical and mental state during this...
Can you help our case?
They can be terrible afflictions, of course, but they don't scare me.
I started praying again since then, you know.
I examined that girl before I drove back to the city that night.
She was lucid and she was completely aware of this separate entity inside her.
When she wasn't in his grip, she was totally herself, completely normal.
The awareness of her alternate mental state is counterindicative of psychosis.
You'll testify to all of this, in detail?
Everything you saw?
We need this.
It's your burden now.
And I told him, as a doctor, I couldn't help her.
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.
Because God knows, I have my own demons.
And I saw something lying on the sidewalk.
It was a gold locket... ... with the initials E. C.B. engraved on it.
My middle name is Christine.
Erin Christine Bruner.
Like I was on the right path.
You sound more like a mystic than an agnostic.
Are you wearing the locket now?
The archdiocese doesn't want you to testify.
I believe a jury will find you sincere and credible and when Dr. Cartwright corroborates your testimony and refutes the prosecution's medical arguments we'll get an acquittal.
Yes, on October the 27th of last year I presented my assessment and recommendation to the archbishop and he authorized the exorcism that day before I left the office.
You mean The Roman Ritual of Exorcism.
A text used by Catholic priests as a guide to performing the exorcism rite.
Yes, I think I actually fell asleep with the book in my hand.
It's a way for demons to mock the Holy Trinity.
What do you make of this gesture, this nod in your direction?
You're really God's gunslinger, aren't you, Father?
Standing tall and facing the devil with your prayer book at your side.
Father, did you understand this black-robed figure to be the devil?
I believe the demonic can appear as an apparition much like a ghost, in an attempt to excite our fear.
So this night, when you began to prepare Emily's exorcism was it your first encounter with this demon ghost?
I've seen it ever since.
No further questions at this time.
Father Moore, after you received the bishop's authorization when did you proceed with an exorcism?
Halloween tradition is based on legends throughout history that indicate a real increase in spiritual activity on that night and I thought we could use the occasion to draw them into the open.
Father Moore can you identify this?
Ever since the technology has been available exorcists have used tape recorders to authenticate the ritual and provide a record for review.
This tape is new evidence that came into our possession yesterday.
We provided counsel for the people with a transcript of its contents.
Don't ask it any questions or pay any attention to what it says.
"It"?
Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on us.
It has begun.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Watch her vital signs.
Tell me your name, wicked one.
He who commands you is he who ordered you thrown down from the highest heaven into the depths of hell.
Ancient serpents depart from this servant of God!
We are the ones who dwell within!
After a few moments, Mr. Rose revived... ... but the exorcism had to be abandoned.
Emily was taken to her room and soon fell into a deep sleep.
The whole thing was a complete failure.
Describe her behavior from the night of the failed exorcism until the time of her death.
I tried to visit every day and the family told me the rest.
And without the consent of the possessed the exorcism ritual can't be performed.
Did you encourage her to eat?
Yes.
Ultimately, we both felt that she was beyond medical care and that she had to see this through to the end by faith alone.
The dual voices we just heard on this tape you're certain that they were both coming from Emily at the same time?
Father Moore, you consider this tape to be proof of the supernatural?
I think it's a record of certain indications that Emily was possessed.
Father, as Emily's parish priest are you aware that she underwent advanced catechism training?
And according to her high school records German was the foreign language she studied there, yes?
I have nothing further.
Does the defense wish to redirect?
Your Honor, my next witness must have been detained.
If we could take a short recess so I could...
Your Honor, please.
We have absorbed some extraordinary testimony today.
I think we'll take some time to consider it.
Court is adjourned until 9:30 tomorrow morning.
- You can't find him?
- I went to meet him, he didn't show.
What the hell happened?
Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.
Tell him I know the demons are real and I admire his courage for standing and speaking against them.
- Cartwright's dead.
- Not yet, but I'm working on it.
Besides that, Father Moore's testimony's crucial to his defense.
Did you forget the archdiocese is paying for this defense?
The archdiocese isn't on trial.
I swore an oath to do what's best for my client.
Spare me the law school pieties, Bruner.
You cashed in your conscience at the door.
It's not over.
You'll be worse off than you are now, if that's possible.
You're gonna replace me on this case.
But just so we're clear, Bruner if you put that priest on the stand again, I will fire you.
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
I know he was your friend.
We've lost.
Without his testimony, it's over.
Erin, you once said that you felt you were on the right path.
Don't stray from that path.
Here, take this.
I saw your eyes today in court when I explained the significance of 3 a. m.
It's not going to stop until Emily's story is told.
Are you gonna make a statement?
The witness is reminded that he is still under oath.
- Why did she ask to see you?
- To give me this.
Did Emily explain to you the letter's significance?
Father Moore, was Emily a good person?
Father Moore's belief in this matter is crucial in establishing his and Emily's understanding of her condition.
And that mutual understanding is paramount in determining whether Father Moore was, in fact, negligent.
I'm going to allow it.
Your Honor, you're not really gonna let someone testify about why God would allow the death of a young girl?
The objection has been overruled.
I can let Emily answer that.
I awoke a few hours later, hearing a voice calling out my name.
And when I looked at her she smiled at me and said:
'Emily, heaven is not blind to your pain."'
Please continue.
"I asked the Blessed Mother, 'Why do I suffer like this?"'
Why did the demons not leave me tonight?
Then she said, 'You can come with me in peace... ... free of your bodily form... ... or you can choose to continue this.
"In the end, good will triumph over evil.
Through my experience people will know that demons are real.
Did you see these wounds on both of Emily's hands and both feet?
And did you attach any supernatural significance to these wounds?
I believe they were stigmata.
By that, you mean supernatural injuries that correspond to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ?
Yes.
Stigmata are a sign, a mark indicating one is touched by God.
After that night, why do you think Emily refused another exorcism?
I believe she'd accepted her fate.
Father Moore attaches divine significance to the wounds on Emily's hands and feet.
That Emily was a saint, touched by the hand of God.
Father Moore's beliefs are based on archaic and irrational superstition.
Emily suffered because she was sick not because she was a saint.
So the defense has given us an extraordinary creative explanation for the events that led to this.
Ladies and gentlemen, don't you believe it.
Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil that did this to Emily Rose.
Counselor.
Ethan Thomas calls himself a man of faith.
I, on the other hand, am a woman of doubt.
Angels and demons.
These things either exist, or they do not exist.
Are we all alone in this life?
Or are we not alone?
Either thought is astonishing.
Do I really believe that this tragedy is the work of the devil?
To be honest, I don't know.
But I cannot deny that it's possible.
The prosecution wants you to believe that Emily's psychotic epileptic disorder was a fact because facts leave no room for reasonable doubt.
But this trial isn't about facts.
This trial is about possibilities.
Is it a fact that Emily was a hypersensitive as Dr. Adani suggests?
I can't say that, but the question is:
Is it possible?
Is it a fact that Gambutrol anesthetized Emily's brain so that the exorcism ritual was rendered ineffective?
I can't be sure of that.
But is it possible?
But ask yourself:
And that sincere belief is what determined her choices and his.
It is not a fact that she was psychotic.
Facts leave no room for possibilities.
The only fact the only thing I know beyond a doubt in this case is that Father Moore loved Emily with his whole heart.
Don't send a good man to prison.
"In the case of The People v. Father Richard Moore we, the jury, find the defendant guilty of negligent homicide."
Sentencing for this case will be set for April 3rd.
Your Honor, if it pleases the court Father Moore requested at the start of trial that if found guilty, he would be sentenced immediately.
Very well.
Yes, I do.
- Very well.
Excuse me, Your Honor but the jury would like to make a recommendation regarding the sentence.
We recommend a sentence of time served.
Have you seen the news?
There's our priest, leaving the courthouse a free man right next to you.
Just like James Van Hopper.
I'm offering you a full partnership in the firm.
Keep it.
Once you've looked into the darkness I think you carry it with you for the rest of your life.
I don't know.
I'm not sure what I've seen.
Emily recited it to me the night before she died.
I don't usually do this... socialize with my students.
I'm glad you're making an exception for me.
I'm sorry, did I overstep?
I'm trying to do the right thing, Kit, you know.
Well, I'm glad you don't feel the need to do that anymore.
Oh, it was my pleasure.
Shit...
I, uh, I did ring the bell but I guess you couldn't hear me over the cacophony.
How are you!
Um - god, I'm not, um - it's kind of a mess, I'm not really prepared for company.
I was just on my way to brunch and I thought I'd drop off this paperwork.
Thank you, um... can I make you a cup of tea?
No, no, not today.
I'll see you Thursday.
Thanks - thanks for coming by!
What's Thursday?
It's the Peabody Foundation dinner for all their grant recipients.
I can't believe she saw me like this.
Like what, like a pregnant woman at home doing normal things in her apartment?
I mean, besides, look - with this.
And now you're going out with the same girl.
You guys - it's that common, you guys just, uh, share chicks and shit?
How do you?
You know it's true.
Look, from what I know, the most important thing is to listen.
Hate to tell you this, Mark, but I don't fuck my roommates.
Damn!
So... can we go back to your place now?
Wha... happened?
I really... really wanna be with you.
Well... well then, will you break up with her after the tournament?
- Hi. _BAR_
- What's up?
Are you gonna invite me in?
Um, to tell you the truth, I'm not really in the mood for company right now.
I'd rather you had called first.
Is there something in particular?
We should talk, Tina.
I mean, we were still together - we were a couple, and you were pregnant, and I had no idea.
I planned to tell you, and then you fucked off.
I want to have a place in this baby's life.
This is our baby, Tina.
Did you use our sperm?
I used the sperm we had stored at the cryobank, yes.
Look, I just need to think about it, okay?
Just give me some time.
Oh, last one.
I can't believe you just did that.
Okay, who would make out with a guy for a million dollars?
Scary can sometimes be... sexy.
They're not scary, they're stupid.
That's right, and stupid, Shane, can be even sexier.
Okay, but would you make out with a friend?
What about two friends at the same time?
No, thank you.
- Congratulations, by the way. _BAR_
Bette's going to be working with Leo Herrera.
He's coming to Los Angeles for six months to help raise money for the California Arts Center.
Now, I'd like to talk to you about this tomorrow morning -
You yourself said that this is the most difficult fund raising climate you've ever faced.
Now if you want to discuss this with me further, please set up an appointment to talk with me during the day, tomorrow.
Without consulting you?
Your buddy Helena Peabody.
The woman is a fucking dragon and she's making my life a living hell.
How's my little bride-to-be?
Ready to play the best tennis of her life?
Maybe you have a secret admirer.
There, is that good for you?
I think this might work.
Thank you.
Your descriptive technique is better, but you're still skating on the surface.
Um, I know that I'm not Clea -
Thought so.
I'm not into the whole student-teacher transference thing.
I prefer to keep the boundaries between us crisp and clear.
I'll, uh... see you later.
Okay, ready?
She is unbelievable.
You are a god, man!
I mean, that's what I call good filmmaking.
How do you know girls like this?
For two hundred dollars you could know girls like that, Gomey.
What are you doing, man?
Who gives a fuck what she's feeling?
Don't ask why, just try it.
And then, write me an essay about your experience.
Oh, f - oh, god, that's Shane, that means Tonya's coming, so, um...
I mean, Dana's really lucky to have you as her manager.
Just one little match 'til we can go back and sleep in our own little beddy-bye, right Pookie-pie?
So when does your silence assignment end?
Is that cool with you?
On the high wire we have our first specimen, the silent ballerina.
And behind me our second specimen, the beautiful temptress.
And to my left our third specimen, the temptress tamer!
Here it is.
No, Kelly, you were a genius in this.
No, really, it's - it's -
Hey, what's up?
Your film. "Lesbians Gone Wild"?
I'm making a documentary.
That's it, she was - she was really nice to you?
What does that mean, exactly?
I'm sorry, that was... that was inappropriate.
It's just it's good, and... guess I'm just a little jealous.
It's just - it's - it's really unbelievable, though, I just - that chick must have some kind of power or something.
I've never seen a girl have that kind of effect on other girls.
Sounds like she's working on you, too.
So does Shane sleep with a lot of girls?
Excuse me.
I'm so glad you decided to come, baby sis, I think it's gonna be good for you.
I'm just doing this to support you, Kit, I'm not doing this for myself.
If you say so.
Do you think he's fine?
Wait 'til you hear him speak.
Just something about the way he moves his body on stage.
That one thing that you most want, that you can't live without!
Say to yourself, What is the most vulnerable position for me?
How can I put myself at risk to lose everything that I have to lose?
Because, when you risk losing everything, you invariably stand to gain everything.
Okay.
Now's the time.
I can't say this, Al, it's horrible!
How is "This isn't easy for me because you've worked really hard and done so much for my career" horrible?
I believe in you.
Did you find it enlightening?
Actually, you said a few things that - hit home.
Well, it was a few more than I was expecting, to be perfectly honest.
Well tell me your thoughts, uh, what in particular resonated for you?
I guess... the comments that you made about... making yourself vulnerable.
You wanna know how to make yourself vulnerable to Tina, so that you and she can raise a child together.
Jesus, have you told him everything that's going on in my life?
Give Tina the flowers, and say "You hold all the cards."
No matter what she says, say... "You hold all the cards."
It is my personal business I don't want some stranger knowing my personal business, especially someone like Benjamin Bradshaw.
Pookie, where are you?
You are an amazing woman.
You came into my life at a time when I was trying to figure out who I really was, and... you made me feel so well taken care of.
But I think I confused it with something else.
I know I confused gratitude... with love.
Which means I care so much about you, I care SO much about you, but... but I know in my heart that we don't belong together.
I am so sorry, I hope you haven't been waiting long, a fan cornered me in the hallway.
Could you give us a minute, please?
She seems to be taking it well, but then again, professional athletes are so emotionless -
Tonya told me you were the strong, stoic type, especially in a situation like this, but I think it's good!
Dana... well, this is what I wanted to talk to you about.
Now, I can't wait to meet your mother.
Now, tell me, who wrote your grant proposal?
Don't these boring, pretentious dinners make you really horny?
Where are you?
I'll be waiting for you by the pool.
What's my excuse?
You know, I was so fucking bored up there.
You were the only thing that wasn't boring me to tears.
You're not timid... are you?
Hadn't pegged you for being timid.
No, I'm not timid.
Well, that's good.
I like the idea of being your first.
This is what I find the most beautiful.
Please help me take the books out.
What's the matter?
You've dragged me down!
What have I done to you?
It's all your fault.
I got it, really got it...
You don't have to finish it in a hurry
Just take your time.
(My Love)
It's our first time to make a film based on Miss Chu's novel.
Miss Chu Xun the love story between the two characters Guo Rong and Yong Lin in your book "My Love" was very detailed
Well, I admit that some of it was my own experience
That guy... does no longer exist.
In fact, Miss Chu has started writing her new book.
Can you tell us something about the new book?
This is a book about supernatural.
What's the name of it?
This book is named "The Recycle".
"The Recycle"
Have you actually seen a ghost?
No, I haven't but, I have heard about some weird things
What kind of weird things?
Why?
I can feel the terror well up from the depths of my heart.
You know, self-experience is crucial to a writer.
But I know her.
Sorry for the inconvenience
Thank you.
When did you come back?
Last night.
Do you have some time?
Can I talk with you?
I'm busy today... we'll talk later.
When did he come back?
He said yesterday.
Then when will there be a continuation of 'My Love'?
(The female lead is called) ("Fang Yu-ling".)
(She has a strong desire of surviving.)
(One day, Yu-ling stayed at home alone.)
(The protagonist is called) (Fung Sin-mei.)
(She is an adventurous lady)
Hello...
Yes, what is it?
Do you have time tomorrow?
My bro has been backed to Hong Kong.
In that case, I'm not free.
Okay, as long as you don't talk about him
Where shall we meet?
Shall we meet at 2 o'clock outside Sogo?
Okay, see you tomorrow.
Hello...
Hao Ran is back, did you know?
He and Xu Fen are divorced.
Won't you give him another chance?
What chance?
Did he ask you to tell me that?
I really don't want to talk about him.
Actually, I should say sorry to you.
My bro asked me to do so, what can I do?
He will ask me about you when I get home.
He really wants to see you.
When did he divorce?
Three months ago.
Well, how is your new book?
In these days, I saw something weird at home.
People said, writing this thing will bring strange things.
Last night, I felt... there's someone else in my house.
One more person?
I found a few strands of hair much longer than mine in the kitchen sink.
I think too much writing is making you hyper sensitive
Did you just mistake?
Please don't keep staring, it's really scaring!
Hello...
(The female lead is called) ("Fang Yu-ling".)
(She has very long hair.) (She is too tall... ) (One night, Fang receives three) (consecutive phone calls at home)
Are... are you alright?
Why do you look like this?
I'm alright... what are you doing here?
What's up?
I tried to call you, but the line was busy, so I come up to see you.
Are you sure you are okay?
I am fine.
what do you want, coming here?
I wanted to see you.
there's something I need to talk to you about... can I come in?
No, you cannot!
Then... can you give me just time for a dinner?
Really?
I divorced.
I know, Sandy told me.
Don't tell me what you want anymore.
Anyway, what you want, you should have done 8 years ago.
No need to wait until now.
Yes, you're right.
Yes, that was the reason.
Then why did you say that you were just making a short trip to see your father-in-law and ended up gone for so long?
I did write to ask you to wait for me
I did get a lot of your letters but they all told me to wait for this and wait for that.
Let's stop here, I don't want to hear anymore
If I had waited it would have taken me 8 years until today.
(Ting-yin... )
(but the lift stops at the 7th) (and the door opens.)
(The corridor.)
Grandma, the lift is here!
Why are you here?
Come and take a seat.
Uncle, could you tell me... what is this place?
Think thoroughly
Do you know how you got here?
In the lift, I saw a grandma and grandson.
This is a place where you should not be.
But why are you here?
You think I'm the same as you?
Do you remember what you've done?
This place is created by you.
It's not only belonged to you, but to the others too.
This is a space for abandoned.
At the same time, they may disappear all of a sudden.
All these are just a kind of cycle, a re-cycle.
We are all here... just because we are a group of abandoned.
I think you have to go now.
What's happening?
stop talking now
When you see the things start eroding, you have to go.
Otherwise you will vanish with them together.
Remember, you can't stay here for long.
Follow me.
Could you tell me who you are?
I don't know who I am
Could you tell me where I am?
Why is it like this?
This is a world that you've forgotten and abandoned.
Abandoned?
The 'spiritual world' that I thought about... really exists?
I am sure you have thrown many toys away during your childhood.
All of them can be found here.
Now you know the true meaning of abandon.
You can't stay here.
You must return to your place...
So, how can I leave this place?
Can you show me the way?
We would be in deep trouble!
Go!
If we couldn't get out of there in time, we would have been eroded.
Let me introduce you to someone.
He must know where the Transit is.
Granny, why are you here?
Remember I told you earlier, I belong to this place.
You should tell her... she has to leave this place ASAP.
Tell us how to get to the Transit.
You wanna go to the Transit?
Granny, please help me.
I do not know this would have happened.
Even I tell you where it is, you cannot find it out by yourself.
I'll take her to the place.
Follow me... this way.
There is a long way from here to the Transit.
Unfortunately, it has not clearly stated the exact location.
There are only several hints from the book.
What hints?
Crescent moon, red earth, fading sky and fading land.
Rootless grass, it's near.
When you arrive at the Transit, it's time to be apart.
Then, what's next?
Take the paper money
Sis, when you walk across the bridge, remember to hold your breath.
Otherwise, we would be in trouble.
Okay, follow me.
Sis, you go first.
Where to go?
Little girl
Are you here?
Little girl
Don't mind it, come over here!
Which way?
Nobody comes after us.
Still be scared?
What are those things?
They are aborted babies.
How poor they are.
Aborted babies?
They keep growing there.
Could you please not leaving me behind again?
I feel so weird.
You said that the abandoned things would turn to be here.
But why do they look so terrible?
Are you okay?
Why do you look so pale?
There are so many flowers!
What is the purpose of picking these flowers?
I am not sure yet...
Granny said we have to pick them, sure they'll be useful.
How could you have seen me before?
Why... why don't you give me a name?
a good idea, after all, I don't know your name
Ting-yu, Ting-yu...
My name is Ting-yin, it is nice.
Who are they?
No one?
They block our way.
How can we walk through them?
Don't be afraid, just follow me.
What's up?
You said they have not been worshipped for a long time, didn't you?
That's right.
You take the paper money with you, they'll be useful.
How many further levels we have to go before arrive at the Transit?
Why are your hands so cold?
I am fine, I think we are at the Transit now.
Can you leave this place with me?
No, if I go to your space, I would become a wanderings spirit.
That would be too poor for me.
So what can I do?
I cannot leave you behind.
Don't worry, I belong to here.
Crescent moon, red earth, fading sky and fading land, rootless grass, it's near...
When you arrive at the Transit, it's time to be apart.
The Transit...
I arrived.
You better hurry.
Are you okay?
You made us here.
You created us and then you dumped us.
I have to make you stay here forever, never leave this place for a lifetime long!
Ting-yu, tell me what should I do?
Ting-yu.
The story ending she's written is here already
what are you talking about?
Who are you?
Mom!
What did you call me?
Your explanation, I would be better off not listening to it
Do you know how painful it is to have to make such a decision?
Please... don't look for me anymore...
Remember the place where the aborted babies live?
I grew up there too.
Ting-yu, it wasn't that mama didn't want you
just that mama...
I am so sorry!
just that mama...
Grandpa!
You finally recognized me, huh?
She wants you to come here and asks you why.
Why don't you go with mama?
Come with me.
You want me to stay with you?
In fact, you could live with me.
But you gave it up.
It was you, you gave up.
Ting-yu!
Ting-yu...
Ting-yu, you must remember your own name!
Can you hear me?
Abby, I write another version.
The storyline has been changed.
When I write, I would subconsciously put myself into the character
It does not just belong to you, but to the others, too.
I am not laying grout.
- My daddy used to give hot shots to prostitutes.
- Feel sorry for me!
- I got the grout.
- Yeah, have a good life now.
- Signing us up for unemployment benefits.
Well, I guess I could use this time to get my acting career off the ground.
- And I fully support you.
It's pathetic." But the new Dennis says that it's not my place to kill your pipe dreams.
- You should go for it.
- Really?
Oh, look, we qualified.
- I know.
Okay, new plan.
Absolutely.
I'm trying to conduct important business back there.
Because the urinal, you flush it, and it sprays all over the place.
You're gonna thank me for it.
I don't want a father figure.
Come down just a little bit.
He's not hitting it that high, you know?
What the hell is this?
And this unemployment thing is so great, because we've made really big plans.
- Why in the hell would we do that?
- You're not even listening to me.
- Did you see myJesus chain?
Charlie, sign here, here and here.
So, you're giving me all your money.
I'm just setting up a temporary account in your name.
What my wife can't find, she can't get.
But you will be handsomely rewarded if you just keep your hands off this money.
- The vig?
- Yeah, man.
Do you even know what "vig" means?
Turns out there's a little program called Work for Welfare... in which businesses hire potential welfare recipients... the government subsidizes their wage... and the I.R.S. Affords thousands of dollars in tax relief.
We hire a couple people, pay them nothing, and get them to do all of our work for us!
- We just pay them nothing?
- We pay them nothing!
- That's incredible.
- It's incredible!
- What do you think, Frank?
- The plight!
- Respect.
- Respect the plight.
What do you think, Frank?
- I understand that.
- That's what I'm talking about.
That's like reverse affirmative action, dude.
- Well, how do you know he's not gonna be a good slave?
I don't even understand.
- It doesn't work that way.
Why don't you read up on some of the program's stipulations?
- Ooh, that's big.
- I see you've decided to steal our welfare idea.
- I can't say I'm surprised.
- We're not stealing your idea, okay?
Later, boners.
I'd like some welfare, please.
And she's mentally retarded?
Oh, most definitely.
You have the proper medical paperwork?
Medical paperwork?
We're gonna need a physician's report to confirm your sister's mental illness... and your blood work to confirm your... crack addiction.
Well, can't you see how retarded she is?
Then we'll go to the doctor, we'll get all of our paperwork, and we'll get full benefits.
Then we'll collect for just a little while until we get settled.
- Then I'll take the MCATs.
Okay.
- What you need?
- Uh, one, please.
One what?
And patient.
- Wh-Which...
Don't say "this one."
Now, Maria, after you're done in the bathroom you come look for me... because I got some boots to be shined, all right?
Tony, go chase that leak down in the basement, all right?
- Amen to that, brother.
- I'll teach you how to play.
- I already know how to play.
Not properly though.
It's like he's really trying to become our father.
- It's not gonna get clean if you don't.
Frank's been hiding all of his money in my account.
And why was I not made aware of this before?
Uh, it's got something to do with the vig.
We're gonna hit an A.T.M. We'll take out just a little bit of cash.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit!
It's 4:00.
I'm freezing and I'm sweating all at once.
I think I may have peed in my pants.
- You think he'll see us on such short notice?
- That's what I do, baby.
Two more, please.
Yeah, I'll buy you stuff.
I'll buy you lots of things.
Driver, pull over!
- Hey, how's it going?
That's enough whining, for crying out loud!
- Something was bound to happen.
Maria, go get us some ice and three beers.
- I don't drink.
- Me neither.
Well, it's a vicious cycle, Mr. Frank.
- Y'ello?
- This is Pam from First National Bank.
Some recent activity on my new account?
- He cut us off.
Then we'll go on welfare, and I'll go be a star.
Then I can be a veterinarian of some kind.
Maybe we should think about rehab.
- We're getting our jobs back.
- We might have a little bit of a drug problem.
- I might not really care.
- I don't give a shit.
- Your positions have been filled.
- So we're gonna take yours.
Did somebody get addicted to crack?
I sweat uncontrollably!
I can't get somebody to have sex with me unless I pay for it!
Why don't we go on inside where it's nice and warm and we can settle this like a family?
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Crack.
I climbed up and carried you down, that's what happened.
I spoke to a very nice woman with the adoption agency.
She said thery were going to try to get in touch with your birth parents.
You can't protect me forever.
I know and it breaks my heart.
I love you dad.
This is Claire Bennet.
It really does break my heart.
Please don't hurt me.
You're not supposed to be in here.
I didn't kill these people, Sylar did.
I love New York.
Mr. Isaac Mendez?
Mr. Isaac?
No English, no passport, no american money, no ID.
When evolution selects its agents, it does so at a cost.
It makes demands in exchange for singularity.
And you may be asked to do something against your very nature.
Suddenly, the change in your life that should have been wonderful, comes as a betrayal.
It may seem cruel, but the goal is nothing short of self-preservation.
Survival.
A celebratory school night.
- So, is that the quarterback?
I don't like him.
I mean, he's a very nice boy, but--
Yes, he's the quarterback.
If you really wanted to make me happy, you'd only date nerds.
Well, it worked out very well for your mother.
Rumor has it you're a local hero.
Pulled a man out of a burning train car.
It's going to be the cornerstone of my campaign for class president.
Claire.
Where have you been tje last two days?
I teleported myself in the future!
Haven't we been over all this?
Then explain this.
It tells the whole story of my heroic journey.
I'm on the subway in Japan.
Been hitting the sake?
I found the book's author, but he was dead!
Then, there's a nuclear explosion.
It all happens in five weeks... and you and I have to stop it.
Definitely the sake.
Look, you're in it too!
How could I know you were going to say that?
We have to go right now!
A girl's life depends on us!
We'll have the fundraiser here, not the ballroom.
So you gonna come tonight?
Well, it would have solved one of our problems.
So I went to the library to see if I could find anything on human flight.
I came across this amazing book.
Listen to this.
This guy knows what's going on.
Chandra Suresh.
You are so-- What do you wanto tell that reporter?
Maybe I shouldn't.
Sorry.
Well, this is macaroni and cheese.
It's what Americans eat when they want to commit suicide slowly.
Your dad said mine was the best he ever had, but he was from India, so--
Well, what about the program on your dad's computer?
Didn't you say he cracked some code?
Know anybody who speaks gibberish?
Madras, Manhattan, this very apartment-- looking for it.
But this isn't anything.
Well, then, why would he build it?
Only "why?" Even after he's dead.
The map is nothing until I can decipher the principle behind it.
You know, if I could find even one such person, it would validate everything he believed.
But I can't.
Your father had a lot of faith in you.
My father only cared about proving he was right.
He left his country, his family, chasing this insanity.
And now I'm wasting my life trying to prove him sane.
- Where did it get me?
- Mohinder!
"Sylar."
What is it?
Yet another question.
I don't know how else to explain this.
I heard a little girl call for help.
So you just waltzed right in, found a kid hiding in a wall, then pulled the name Sylar out of your ass, when only a handful of us know that name.
Did the voices tell you anything else?
They want you to do things?
Rob a store, kill the president?
No.
Can you tell me what I'm thinking?
I know what that's like.
How much longer do I have to be in here?
Yeah, well if someone finds it, we'll just tell 'em you're some visual effects geek who did it with his computer.
Now, can I get back to my life, please?
So what, I can crawl through a wood chipper, and live to tell about it.
That narrows my choices in life to freak or guinea pig.
In most cases, both.
What's wrong with wanting to be normal?
You should try it.
What are you doing here?
The door was open.
Isaac, you have to get back to work.
You were taking them, weren't you?
I'm not going into rehab.
How am I supposed to paint the future?
Look around you at all these paintings!
Every one of them has come true.
Yes.
I don't want to lose you, Simone.
But if you don't believe in me, then you shouldn't be here.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
Who are you calling?
Thet's because you're crazy.
I'd hang up on you too if I could.
This is the spot!
A young girl dressed in a school uniform... will step in front of a speeding truc.
What school girl?
I don't know.
Stop, watch out!
I did it!
You did it!
So you believe me now?
- How'd you sleep?
On our way to Grandma's house.
Micah!
You look thin.
Look, I know what it's like to raise a boy on your own.
But that boy needs more than you've been giving him.
Why, because D.L. grew up to be such a model citizen?
My son, your husband, is a good man.
You recognize this?
I found it in the desert.
What's that supposed to be?
This belonged to one of the men that your son murdered.
I took it out of the grave.
You know that all of D.L.'s crew wore these.
And he'd be rotting in some prison if he hadn't escaped.
I want you out of my son's life.
Paulette, you have no idea what I am capable of.
You want to tell me why I'm still here, or am I just gonna follow you around?
We're keeping her here, where it's safe, until we can figure out what to do with her.
She hasn't said a word since we brought her here.
We've pieced a trail across a dozen states.
But only some of them involve any mutilation of the head or neck, so they don't see the connections.
You think it's all him.
I think it's gonna get a lot worse if someone doesn't go after him.
What are you actually gonna do if Sylar's in there?
If Sylar killed my father, I need to know why.
I suppose that would have been too easy.
Or we could just break in.
A little light reading before bed.
Oh, my God.
That map, those strings-- It's exactly like your father's.
- Not yet.
- Mohinder--
We're keeping her in a safe room down here.
Freeze!
How could he find me?
Show me your hands!
Do it or I'll put you down!
You okay?
I'm confused.
We're changing the future.
By taking action we've changed soemthing.
What if we make it worse?
A hero doesn't run away from his destiny.
My only concern is... whether I need to hide my true identity.
Perhaps a costume?
You even mention tights and a cape, I'm going home.
Does it say we have to fly coach?
Where are you going?
Aren't you supposed to be on your shift?
Well, try.
Look, the truth is, I've been trying to save the world, one person at a time but I'm meant for something bigger.
I'll miss you.
It's New York.
Everyone runs into each other sooner or later.
Maybe it'll be sooner.
Flames were everywhere.
Oh, my God, I could hear the poor man coughing somewhere inside the train car.
Nice effigy.
I would have filled his head with firecrackers, but that's just me.
I'm not as flammable as he is.
Dale Ledgerwood's got a keg in the back of his truck.
Are you sure this is okay?
Jackie told me you wanna meet your real mom and dad.
I told Jackie that in confidence.
You do realize you were talking to Jackie, right?
Is that why you're bummed?
Why do you think I'm bummed?
You don't seem like yourself.
Thought maybe something was wrong.
You don't know me well enough to know when I'm not being myself.
Put crackers in your sandwiches to make them crunch.
And you're usually the first person to laugh at a joke.
But I haven't heard you laugh in a while.
Lately you seem sort of sad.
Have you been spying on me?
Claire, my goal tonight is to hear you laugh.
Did you put firecrackers in his head, just for me?
Hey, you waited up for me.
Look, I know I missed our therapy session.
I'm really trying, Matt.
You know, this marriage may not mean anything to you--
But ever since, it's like you're mad at me for getting what I wanted, because you haven't.
I don't mean to be.
I can't do this anymore.
I wish he would just leave.
Want to go back to the party?
You know what?
What's gotten into you?
- No, stop it!
Don't be a bitch.
You haven't said a word the whole way home.
You know, the one with those ginormous banana splits?
Why don't you believe that Dad's innocent?
I mean, you should be trying to help him.
They're gonna catch him, and he's gonna go away for a long time.
Micah, do you know where he is?
It's okay.
Is there a problem, Officer?
Mr. Linderman wants to see you.
I'm with my son.
So I guess sooner rather than later.
To love.
May we stay away from it when it's no good for us.
There's just something different.
There's something I should tell you.
I've been in love with you since the minute I first laid eyes on you.
Everyone excuse me.
I'd like to apologize about the rain.
If you elect me, I promise I'll try and do something about it.
I'd like to welcome you all here, on behalf of my family, my entire campaign staff.
I'm sure that you know my brave wife would be here by my side, were she able.
The life-altering event of my father's death is really what prompted me to run for Congress.
My father hid a deep depression-- an illness, really-- up until the day he died.
His loving wife, his attentive children, his loyal friends-- we all knew about it, and yet he suffered alone.
As many of you might have read, my brother Peter had an accident.
My first instinct was to keep his illness hidden.
But no one should suffer alone.
Because we're all connected somehow.
And we need to look out for each other.
Let me check to see if we still have any left.
We're not flying.
Why not?
It says we rent a car.
We drive all the way?
Yes, in a Nissan Versa.
Do you know how long that's going to take?
Suppose she doesn't have that exact car?
It's our destiny.
So, where to?
Las Vegas.
It's our destiny.
How you doing?
What's he looking at?
Barking up the wrong tree, pal.
What am I doing here?
Am I that desperate?
What if I just disappeared?
Would anybody care?
How long would it take to notice I'm gone?
You son of a bitch!
Let him go.
Easy, Pete, that's our mother you're talking about.
There was no reporter on my story!
There would have been, eventually.
I had to take control of things before something happened.
You get it, right?
Look, what Nathan said, it's not true.
This force, evolution, is not sentimental.
Like the earth itself, it knows only the hard facts of life's struggle with death.
All you can do it hope and trust that when you've served its needs faithfully, there may still remain some glimmer of the life you once knew.
Holy--
my mother -- she was murdered when i was a boy.
i was there. i saw it.
there were three men arrested for those murders.
one's deceased,one's doing life without possibility, and that's the only one that's still an open case -- santos jiminez.
1972!
i don't care what you did. it's okay.
who the fuck are you?
oh,pardon my tits.
how could you do this to rita,not to mention her kids?
hey,rita broke up with me,okay?
'cause when you're around, i kind of feel like i can deal with anything,you know?
morgan... your past is a bigger mystery than fucking jimmy hoffa.
it's time to make doakes go away.
sergeant doakes is on administrative leave pending an internal affairs investigation.
promise me that you won't leave me, that you won't go anywhere.
i'm not going anywhere.
you know how much i wanted to... is that the sports section?
i used to enjoy quiet mornings, but ever since the fire at lila's loft, she's been crashing here a bit too often.
uh,no,it's okay. just...keep it.
and so now i share the kitchen with a cobra and a mongoose.
did somebody drink all the coffee again?
no. somebody didn't drink all the coffee.
i had a cup,and dexter had a cup, and it just kind of went like that until the pot was empty.
deb,please. what?
someone didn't drink all the coffee. stupid question.
why are you sticking up for her,anyway?
has the fire damage been repaired yet?
again,dex,thanks for sticking up for me.
what's this?
it's the dragon zombie.
cody likes to hide things in my bag.
oh,honey -- honey,no.
you said we could make breakfast.
i guess i should give rita back her key.
cody,no. no,let mommy get the d-- it's dexter!
he brought doughnuts!
i did. i also brought... a dragon zombie!
could you watch them while i finish getting ready?
astor still has homework.
thank you,dexter.
meet me at the car.
good thing i dropped by.
please,dexter,just stay away.
where would you like us to start?
by answering every question as honestly and with as much detail as you can.
excuse me,sir. answering questions?
that is correct.
i can hardly expect you to investigate your own cases.
what are you saying?
are we under investigation?
or a police officer.
is that why you brought in all these suits?
special agents.
sir,you risk alienating every cop on the task force if you do this.
we go where the chase leads us... even if it gets messy.
it's insulting.
we're just as capable as they are of looking into our own cases.
who wears a wool suit in the middle of summer in miami?
nazis -- that's who. it's all about intimidation.
what do you mean? "us" who?
morgan,i'd like to go over some of your cases tomorrow.
got them all listed right there.
way to stand tough,dexter.
sorry.
that's exactly how hitler walked.
it seems my manifesto unintentionally helped lundy narrow his focus.
that's what i get for trying to emulate lila and take the offensive.
i've always worked best in the shadows, and that's where i have to stay.
he sounds desperate.
you know you're gonna be called in.
i'll be curious to see if i show up.
okay,james,you need to be a little careful here.
and who was it that suspended me again?
oh,shit. that was you.
please,don't act like you didn't deserve it.
what makes you think i want to keep my job?
are you just talking here, or is this something that you've seriously considered?
well,you and i both know that i've gone as high as i can over there.
maybe it's time to move on.
well,what would you do?
yeah,i can just see you putting on an apron every morning.
government contractors?
they're always looking for people like you.
yeah,you got that right.
all right. set it up. i'll meet with your guy.
officer morgan. debra.
yes?
i picked the rodrigo case for you to look into -- small-time dope dealer.
arrested for murder,ended up walking free, then disappeared off the face of the earth until his body was found in a garbage bag in the ocean.
not exciting enough for you?
well,it's just...i'm homicide.
i mean,i thought you didn't want us checking into our own cases.
you're new to homicide.
at the time of this case,you were still in vice.
no conflict there.
well,i'm flattered you want me in on this,but... batista and doakes were lead here.
i feel kind of weird about investigating my own colleagues.
you know what i mean.
would you have dinner with me tomorrow night?
or would that make you feel weird?
i'd love to have dinner with you.
good.
i like the smell. don't you?
like something exciting happened here.
it's like when a piece of bread gets stuck in the toaster.
you like to pretend there's no poetry in you.
who knows what they're saying?
you know insurance companies -- anything to keep from paying out.
yeah,especially when a fire has multiple points of origin.
uh,you know,i just returned cody's toy, and that was it.
no quickie on the kitchen table?
rita doesn't have a kitchen table.
oh,clever way of not answering the question.
it was... awkward,actually.
always is.
you can't go back. you know that.
i'm not trying to go anywhere.
well,the bed's all ready.
uh,i can't.
and why would that be?
i have too much work to do.
i have all these case files i have to go over for tomorrow.
you didn't bring any work with you?
home. i need to...work at home.
so,i'll see you tomorrow?
whatever.
is it possible she started that fire on purpose?
i can't imagine why.
what i do know is that i can't take any risks right now.
hi,you wanted to -- morgan,come in.
can i offer you some tea?
uh,no,thank you. i'm... and he pours it anyway.
he's trying to throw me off balance, show that i don't have the power to say no to him.
how about some sesame crackers to go with that?
oh. sorry. guess i ate them all.
asshole.
your reports were a real pleasure to read.
concise,meticulous. i appreciate that.
good. thank you.
does your sister prefer meat or fish?
uh,no. just deb.
or is she more of a salad kind of person?
kind of blew it,didn't you?
i'm sorry?
anthony rodrigo -- crack dealer with an apparent habit of killing people who got in his way.
i believe this was -- yes -- doakes' and batista's case.
bloodwork that in the course of the trial was proven to be,well...wrong.
so,you -- one of the most cautious and precise forensic specialists i've had the pleasure to work with -- you performed bloodwork that directly led to rodrigo walking free.
i'm sorry. you've caught me off-guard here.
sloppy bloodwork.
look,this wasn't my idea.
could have said no.
come on,angel,we have a job to do.
since when is it my job to try and prove to a fellow police officer that i'm not a serial killer?
you know that's not what this is about.
what is this about?
it's about trying to find someone who had motive and opportunity to kill all 18 of our victims.
um,no way it's anybody in our department.
then help me prove it.
go through the rodrigo case with me.
the rodrigo file.
you just happen to have it with you.
i'm a reasonable man.
i'm familiar with the process.
perhaps,but if you then examine the blood trail -- which we know isn't a blood trail, but projected blood.
you're not winning me over here,morgan.
the truth?
by all means.
i obviously overlooked a few things.
a murderer walked free because you were overworked?
yes.
he's a nutjob... but it says he lived next door to rodrigo, filed all kinds of complaints.
but he filed complaints about everybody.
he'd just sit at his window all day and call us every time he saw someone move.
he called us once to say there was something weird about the clouds.
still no harm talking to him,right?
lenny asher?
who the hell are you?
can we come in?
who's dead?
anthony rodrigo.
i know. they found him in the ocean.
i hope a whale ate him and shat him out, and then ate him again.
yeah,you made numerous calls about him when he used to live here.
you actually saw that?
they were dead. that's all i needed to know.
any thoughts as to who might have killed him?
how the hell should i know?
look at that joker parked right in front of the fire hydrant.
i got his license plate,though.
um... that would be our car.
you,uh,take a lot of notes?
anything hinky happens outside this window, i make a note on it.
how long you been doing that?
since someone stuck a nail in my tire -- march 1998.
rodrigo was last seen alive the day after his trial -- april 16,2002.
think you might have taken any notes that day?
if something happened,i did.
you still have those notes?
here. 2002.
what kind of order did you put them in?
i told you -- 2002.
i have no idea if lundy bought my excuse.
either way, it makes me a little anxious to see my sister looking through the rodrigo files -- looking for me.
you're never gonna guess what i found.
what did you find?
an apartment.
oh. great.
one-bedroom near 78th and harding.
wow. big change.
yeah,well,it's time,you know?
well,good for you. when do you move?
i thought you broke up with gabriel.
no,it's...someone new.
lundy.
lundy,special agent lundy?
i don't.
i mean i'm sure you wouldn't do anything like that.
like try to sleep your way to the top.
no,of course not.
i shouldn't have even said anything, and i'm sure that thought would never even occur to anyone else.
double douche!
you are not allowed to talk about anyone i date as long you're seeing little miss "pardon my tits."
i am sorry,dex,but she is gross... and pale,and nobody is pale in miami.
you just described the perfect woman.
truth is i need to avoid lila for now.
i can't be unprepared like that again.
hey,it's me.
oh,i thought you knew -- it's my bowling night.
what,like fred flintstone?
i'm more in the barney rubble category.
how fun. i'd love to watch you bowl.
it's not really a spectator sport.
oh,well,i'll close my eyes.
but it's sort of the guys' night out.
come on,dexter,i want to meet your friends.
i guess i'm going bowling.
he only got three pins down.
yeah,well,i like to celebrate the little things in life.
you are perfectly adorable.
how come you got a hug and i got a pat on the nose?
'cause you're like a retarded puppy.
if you guys will excuse me,i need to use the ladies' room.
very,uh... gray.
yes,the bureau have always been known for their fashion sense.
honestly,all i care about is the kitchen.
you cook?
like i said,best restaurant in miami.
well,don't ever expect me to return the favor... unless you're a big fan of toast.
i would love to eat your toast.
gosh,that sounded wrong.
so,what's for dinner?
uh,steak florentine and grilled potatoes italian-style.
fucking-a.
now start peeling potatoes.
i like a man that takes control.
wash your hands first.
you're so turning me on.
you know,considering our age difference, you're not too old to spank.
you sure you don't want to grab a beer with us,dexter?
nah,thanks. i'm tired.
mmm,i hoped you saved enough energy for me.
that doesn't exactly look like the look of love.
i'm sorry. i really am tired.
you okay?
dexter,you're bleeding. it's not deep.
i mean,what the hell?
yeah,i know. scary,right?
anyone get a license plate?
no,it was all too fast.
i'll take care of him.
so,who was it?
who?
santos jiminez,the man who murdered my mother.
if you hadn't have seen him in time -- shh!
i did see him. that's all that matters.
none of this scares you?
nothing you could do,dexter,would scare me.
i believe you.
whatever comes, we'll get through this together.
i'm not leaving your side,dexter.
i'm not leaving yours.
really?
why would you think that?
you've just been a bit distant lately.
i get that way when i'm stressed.
what are you stressed about?
right now,nothing.
do you think dexter will come for breakfast tomorrow?
oh,i-i don't think so,honey.
well,maybe we should call him.
it's kind of late.
but dexter stays up late.
she doesn't want to call him.
why not?
dexter and i broke up.
why?
they don't like each other anymore.
well,that's not true.
does that mean he doesn't like us,either?
oh,no. of course he likes you.
it's just...it's hard when two people break up.
it makes them sad to see each other.
i don't think dexter's gonna be coming for breakfast for a while.
sorry.
lila may be the right woman for me but she's wrong about one thing recovery simply isn't an option when i let my guard down, i open myself up for attack or capture i need to embrace who i am, who i've always been.
i need to kill the man who murdered my mother.
so how come it's so suffocating in here?
hey. it's nice to see you.
yeah,feels all warm and comfy.
i spoke to todd about you.
Yeah?
he's very interested.
he said someone with your special-ops background typically starts at about $200,000.
i could live with that.
you can meet him tonight. 9:00,bar at the hilton.
i'll be there.
sergeant doakes. i appreciate your time.
can we get this over with,sir?
the rodrigo case -- lost due to bad bloodwork.
excuse me?
oh,you weren't aware of that?
are we through here,sir?
no,actually. we're just getting -- we're done.
"march 17th -- airplane flying too low."
i told you,this guy's a fruit bat.
"april." hey,it's the month we want.
"april 16th"... fuck me sideways,listen to this.
i'm gonna get lundy.
lila almost had me believing it was possible to change, to become something else, as if that ever really happens.
i've always known what i am.
if the glove fits... a secret cabin in the middle of the everglades -- what more could a rededicated serial killer ask for?
what a bad,bad man.
"ugh,there is no such plate."
kind of busy here.
then can you please tell me where i can find dexter?
i brought him some dinner.
dexter's not here.
he said he was working late.
is that what he told you?
what do you mean?
he's not working late.
i think he lied to you.
oh,men are such pigs.
i told you lenny would be a waste of time.
maybe it's not a florida plate.
try georgia.
holy shit,here it is.
the vehicle was registered to charlie lewis.
i know that name.
that's our guy. that's the bay harbor butcher.
i told you he wasn't a cop.
what?
shit.
where is he?
according to this,south bay correctional facility.
by our department.
where was the vehicle held?
right here in our evidence lab,behind a secure gate.
someone signed the vehicle out,picked rodrigo up, killed him,and then signed the vehicle back in.
so you have records.
why would we keep them?
bay harbor butcher is one of our own.
we keep this to ourselves for now -- just the three of us.
i'm gonna go tell it to a bottle of scotch.
here we are again.
let me out of here!
but... i'm finding it's best to accept things you can't change, you know?
normally,i'd have a chat to make sure you understand why you're here,but... i think you have a pretty good idea.
let me go.
i got cocaine.
you can have all of it.
it's funny you should say that. i am off the wagon.
but that was never my drug.
i'll fucking kill you!
no,mr. jiminez.
i'm gonna kill you tonight... for what you did to my mother... and because,well,this is what i do best.
it's kind of fitting,don't you think?
astor,cody,come on,let's eat.
how'd you get the door unlocked?
it was already open.
oh,that's odd.
dexter,hi.
um,look,i'm sorry to bother you, and i'm sure this is nothing, but i was just wondering if by chance you were at my house.
rita,get out of the house. call the police.
i'll be there as soon as i can.
i can't take you with me.
don't go anywhere!
oh,hey,i'm sorry to drag you into this.
no,no,i'm glad you called. the kids?
next door.
the place is empty. no sign of forcible entry.
i'm guessing you just forgot to lock the door.
if you need anything else -- no,no. you're not leaving.
give me rita's key.
well,that's your fault,isn't it,dexter?
you lied to me about working late, and i thought i might find you there.
is this the monster that you keep telling me about?
trust me,when you meet the monster,you'll know.
you called jiminez.
yeah,i suppose i did.
why?
why would you try to have me killed?
you weren't going to get killed.
that's why i did it at the bowling alley, so all your police-officer friends would be there.
you were pulling away,and... remember at the hotel after you faced jiminez?
that -- that's what i wanted!
to bring you back.
so you called him?
well,it worked,didn't it?
you -- you are more dangerous than my addiction will ever be.
that's saying a lot.
stay away from rita.
stay away from me.
or what?
or you will see the monster.
You, on the other hand, have been a very naughty little Smurf.
- Bi-curious, are we?
- I see.
First, you systematically destroy my marriage...
I know about everything, Charlie.
...and now you want me to help with your career.
I don't think you heard me.
I wrote something.
- I don't think that's appropriate.
Is there anything I can help you with?
- You look great, Mom.
Oh, shit.
- What's worse luck is getting married itself.
Sometimes more... three out of two.
I bageled him.
- I want to live with Dad.
- Then there were two.
And then there was one.
- Fantastic.
You inspired that stain, you cunning linguist, you.
What were you doing in my bedroom, you perv?
- By the way, how come you never told me Bill's little Lolita of a daughter was a writer?
In fact, she insists that I pump it, launch her agenting career, or she's gonna hit me with the mother of all sexual-harassment suits.
Oh, Charlie, I'm sorry.
Do you think you can get me a front-row seat to the trial?
What the fuck do you want me to say?
You fuck around with your assistant, you're gonna get screwed.
There's only a few things that could happen, all of them bad.
She... she might have some talent, from what I've seen, the little I have seen.
There's this young woman who's bangin' this older guy, and at one point, you know, she... she hauls off and just punches him right in the face.
Fucking And Punching.
You need to get on top of that kind of shit, Hank.
Cos I was over at Mia's school that day, and it was very progressive, like maybe they didn't adhere to that kind of strict...
Well, I don't know... to embarrass me.
To score some big fucking victory over Bill.
The system that's been working for us since we split up, that's not working any more?
No, I'm not looking...
- What do you mean, OK?
Get out of my house, cos I don't want to see you right now!
She's... she's in a meeting with Mr Runkle.
Tricky Vicky, he used to call me, back in the day.
Where the hell have you been, Hank Moody?
Haven't you owed me a book since the good guy was in office?
Yeah, it's been seven years, thanks for asking.
Hank, do you think you two could do this a little bit later?
Well, handle it, then.
- Is that right?
Have I ever been wrong about this shit?
It's fantastic.
Well, coincidentally, I have a lame boner right now.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you for giving me notes and helping me with this.
Hank, you're so sweet.
What do you want me to do, blow you, Hank?
I mean, that would be untoward.
Oh, my God, look at the potty mouth on this one.
I love it.
What the fuck is the matter with you?
What do you have, epilepsy, Asperger's, Tourette's?
Have you signed the papers yet?
Look, we have our prenup, we have our wills.
You know, she's moving out.
She doesn't want to live here any more.
I can't tell what's worse... whether she doesn't know she's ripping my heart out, or whether she does know, but, you know, she just doesn't care.
No, it's not about that, trust me.
As soon as her father lets her down, she'll be begging you to bring her back home, I promise.
He'll probably disappoint her on the car ride home and have to turn around.
Don't make me laugh, cos I'm trying to wallow here, OK?
Thank you ever so kindly.
So you had your fun and then you told them the truth, right?
Told them what, Hank?
You know, I think I'd appreciate your particular brand of humour a lot more if you weren't fucking around with my life.
And you haven't fucked around in mine at all?
I mean, I know, I know... it was an accident.
The simple fact remains, you fucked me and you didn't want to have anything to do with me.
- That doesn't sit well with the ladies.
Yeah, well, we all pay for our sins sooner or later, Hank.
Thank you.
How'd you get ahold of it?
Well, it was just sitting there all unappreciated and shit, and I asked Karen if I could read it.
- And she said no.
- Exactly.
She was afraid that I would get corrupted in some way.
Anyway, I took it to Kinko's and settled in for what was truly a great read.
It's so good, Hank.
People are gonna recognise my writing.
No, see, I covered my tracks.
I added little bits of me when I re-typed it.
It's not really so much an outright theft as a mash-up.
Yes, but I never set out to hurt you, Mia.
What else is out there for me, huh?
College, going to Europe, working at an agency, a network, a studio?
I never intended to be famous, but I do like being the centre of attention.
It feels just like I thought it would... totally fucking great.
But it's gonna go away.
We seem to be all out of champagne.
It's been a great ride, Charlie Runkle.
She was great, wasn't she?
I mean, she was poised, she was funny... she had them eating out of her hand and looking up her skirt at the same time.
Yeah, that is quite a feat.
The girl's gonna sell five million copies based on the jacket photo alone.
And did you see how completely unfazed she was by Hank?
I mean, no offence, he's a cool guy, but it was kind of pathetic, right?
Yeah, Dani, I actually have a little bit of a headache, you know?
You know, you can always bring your stuff home, for me to wash on the weekends or whenever.
I know.
Cos your dad, you know, he'll probably just buy you new clothes when the old ones get dirty.
- Mom?
- Whatever.
- Hey, I was just teasing.
That's what sisters do, you know?
They borrow clothes, talk about boys, conspire against the parental units...
You know, it's not gonna be any fun here without you.
- Was it fun before?
Like taking Kafka to the Third Street Promenade.
He can't pretend any more that it's not.
Yeah, I guess not.
The death of hope.
Well, that's not entirely true.
He's got you.
We should all be so lucky.
Loved your new novel.
Well, I'm just overjoyed that you saw me in there somewhere.
What's the fuckin' deal?
You have done some fucked-up shit in your time, but I didn't think you'd do that.
She was at a book store, and she was reading my book.
You know, that's always a great conversation starter for me, and she was cute and flirty, I was half in the bag, anyway.
Jesus Christ.
How'd we get ourselves into this one?
Thank you for saying we.
Look, I'll do whatever you want me to do, you know?
I'll take it off the counter, you... you say the word.
- Are there offers?
If I say anything, if I do anything about this shit, there's no telling what she's gonna do.
There's no stopping her from telling Karen or Bill or Becca.
Fuck the police.
Expecting someone?
Let me get that.
- Good evening, ladies.
- I'm sorry.
Just think of it as me on the road with the band, playing a few out-of-town gigs.
Plus, you get a break from my noisy guitar.
Yeah, but I love your noisy guitar.
Call me if you need anything, OK?
Anything at all.
She's highly emotional, that one.
All the good ones are.
Are you OK?
You seem depressed.
I'm peachy.
Trust me.
Hey, Bill.
Thank god you came along.
I know Dr. Suresh.
I can take you to him.
Right after we defeat his entire army.
She won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I am taking her to the company.
We have someone else who needs us.
we would like you to bring her in.
You were with a boy.
There's no boy, dad.
I tried out for cheerleading.
But you promise me that you won't date.
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have let him cover for me.
It was his choice, Peter.
My brother could be a right fool sometimes.
How are you planning on doing that?
I'm not risking your life too.
We were both in that Montreal painting.
I think i'm supposed to go with you, Peter.
What for?
To kill the bitch.
Stop, please!
I can't take it anymore.
It's a no on all three.
- Next!
- Are you crazy?
Claire was awesome.
I vote "Yes".
Thanks for trying.
How was that?
Perfect, yet again.
How much longer are we gonna do this?
It's been hours.
I want to go home.
Soon, i promise.
Let's take a break.
Are you ever gonna tell me what's going on here?
Where are we?
I mean, you just grabbed me off the street-
Not exactly like you.
So that's what it's called.
Why is this happening to me?
We're not really sure.
You have been given an extraordinary gift.
i agree.
You are a very special person, Miss Dawson.
Who are you?
It's really quite extraordinary.
Good.
A variant of the Shanti virus.
You're experimenting with the virus?
Think how many people were killed by Gabriel Gray.
It's for the greater good.
So she's a lab rat.
You're just going to inject her without her consent.
No, Dr. Suresh, you are.
It's a mutated strain, manufactured.
You're just gonna have to take that chance.
I never agreed to experiment on people.
You brought them Molly, didn't you?
Now you've got principles, and that's fine.
Don't disappoint me, Suresh.
Something wrong?
I lied to my dad.
Claire, i can fly.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
You're a total babe, and you have a power.
By definition, you're better than she is.
I knew girls just like her at my old school.
All would take is one person to stand up to her.
Well, be that person.
Take her down a notch.
How?
Public humiliation?
We could give her a taste of her own medicine.
Your ability is fascinating.
A gift.
What i do is terrible.
Like what?
I could move objects with my mind.
I could hear a pin drop from miles away.
You want to be different?
It can be wonderful.
Is there a problem?
It's okay.
We'll cross the border together.
I'm glad to have found you, Gabriel.
I work in the textile factory now.
Cut the crap.
Where are the paintings?
You think you intimidate me?
I taught you everything!
Then you know what i'm capable of.
Don't make me do this.
What is this?
You want information?
The Haitian can't help you.
Your wedding in Capri.
The births of Andre and Mikhail.
Start with the day he met his wife.
Tell me about Katarina.
Your honeymoon.
Her favorite flower.
I can't remember.
Really?
After 35 years together, such a shame.
Hi, honey.
Is everything all right?
Hey, dad, yeah.
I was just wondering if i could borrow the car tonight.
Did you ask your mother?
i did, and she said to ask you.
I'm gonna be with the cheerleaders later.
Just thought you should know.
Full disclosure and all.
Well, that's very responsible of you, Claire.
Lock the doors this time.
Management training in Tulsa.
And i'm late for a session.
I'm a quick learner.
I've gotta go.
What do you think?
I'm protecting her from animals like you.
You can't hide forever.
I'm like you.
Family comes first.
I miss that.
I want you back.
We have new directives.
You have my word.
What about the paintings?
You'll be told everything.
I can give you your life back.
Trust me.
What is that?
A border fence, not finished yet.
That is America right there.
attention, you're in violation of U.S. Immigration!
We have notified border patrol.
What's-What's that for?
A Cholinergic.
It's the last phase of your testing.
One shot, you can go home.
Fine.
Just make it fast.
I can't do this.
Dr. Suresh?
I won't do it.
If you don't, someone else will.
And there's more where that came from.
I'm taking Molly, and i'm leaving.
Just drive, now!
No, no, no, no, no.
Let her alone.
You can use your gift.
No.
Drive.
The sharpie doesn't lie.
Appearance matters, girls.
Is this really necessary?
Hell, yes.
I might have to basket catch one of these tubettes.
I'll do your biology homework for a week.
You have five minutes.
I appreciate the effort, really.
You are slow, aren't you?
Oh, my god.
She was right there.
find anything, Ray?
How much have you had to drink tonight, Miss Marshall?
Yaeko's father is there.
You take out the guard, we will follow.
You've given me purpose, carp.
I'm really a hero.
And more, you've made me a better man.
That was easy enough.
You must stop them.
Can i speak with you for a moment?
I owe you an apology.
What i asked you to do was wrong.
I've been with the company for 30 years.
Yes.
I know, i know.
We both have a lot at stake.
Sound good?
I will get something for your lip.
It's that delicious power.
Maya's learning quickly.
Somebody could have seen us.
And no one will ever believe Debbie.
Is she gonna be okay?
Definitely.
She freaked, but just think of it As a lesson in humility.
She blew a.13.
Which means we have an opening.
Tell me something, Ivan.
This daughter.
She died, didn't she?
Leukemia.
It would be awful if they were taken.
Almost as if she never existed.
It's in the warehouse near the train yard.
Where we tagged the liquid man.
You'll find your paintings there.
Thank you.
I wish it were that easy.
You taught me well, my friend.
You can stop running!
Shoot me and there is no turning back.
You'll condemn yourself to hell.
I know.
Kensei, i've been searching for hours.
I saw you, Hiro.
So you've been lying to me all along.
And i swear i will not give in to love.
That kiss will be our last.
All right, carp.
Let's go.
Here.
Also, here.
It's fully loaded.
You're like my own personal Oprah.
You have an amazing gift.
So look around.
Seems to me like this town could use a little amazing.
Thanks.
Hello, Dr. Suresh.
Back to my old self, thanks to the company.
That's okay, isn't it?
What does it mean?
What is this place?
I don't know.
Someone knew i was coming.
"We were right about the Company.
No, and i don't know about any Company.
I don't know about any of this.
We'll figure it out.
Peter, how did we-
I don't know.
We're in New York.
Where is everyone?
It's an evacuation order.
June 14, 2008.
This is next year.
And now, coming to the line, last year's Rookie of the Year, Casey Alfonso!
In lane two, nine-time national champion, Tony Kumer.
Okay, looks like we're ready to go!
Let's hear it, folks!
And it's Casey Alfonso, by less than half a car length!
What a spectacular finish for the young female.
How does it feel to be nine-time national champion...
That'll leave something in the lock box for the rest of us.
And you'd treat Methuselah if his snot had an interesting color.
Means you've already decided which case you wanna take next.
You can't save her life, 'cause she's not dying.
Her labs show signs of dehydration, means the problem's just likely heatstroke.
Kind of hard to get heat struck in four and a half seconds.
Not when you're wearing a three-layer fireproof suit.
Excuse me, Dr. House?
May we talk in private?
So, either it's heatstroke, in which case we take the afternoon off, or it's one of the diagnoses that you guys are gonna have for me in two minutes.
Cop?
He's not packing.
Your dad's either a cop or a security guard.
Or she carries a weapon.
Now, we believe he may be the victim of an assassination attempt.
If you're willing to help us, we need to leave now.
You seriously expect anyone to believe that?
It helps when you have props.
Keep your eye on my pen.
Very good.
Any nausea or vomiting before the seizure?
We're gonna give you an MRI to be sure, but I'm guessing your symptoms were caused by just dehydration in the heat.
You're guessing?
Look, I make a living driving 300 miles an hour, which makes the ability to stay conscious kind of important.
I'm sure it's just heatstroke, but we're gonna do an MRI to be extra careful.
You said you left your cell in your office.
There was nothing on your race car driver's CT and the history and physical were normal.
Her deep tendon reflexes seemed a bit weak to me.
Areflexia could mean Miller Fisher.
Yes, areflexia could mean Miller Fisher, but since the reflex was weak, not absent, it doesn't mean anything.
We think it's Miller Fisher, an inflammatory process.
So, why should I trust you to figure out what it is?
It looks a lot better on 24.
I take that back.
Dr. Samira Terzi.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. House.
This is Dr. Sidney Curtis from the Mayo Clinic.
Nope, but it is keeping my piano level.
So, where is the poor sick fella?
What do we do?
I don't know yet.
Personally, I think she overplayed it.
She's being uncooperative because you made us all look like idiots.
We're only gonna look like idiots if we can't figure out how to get her to agree to the treatment.
What would House do right now?
Pop a pill, insult us and trick the patient.
We can do that last part.
She's never met House before, has she?
Who's got a cane?
What do you want?
I'm gonna do what doctors aren't supposed to do, admit I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have been so quick to dismiss your symptoms.
But you need to let us start the plasmapheresis.
I don't know what this is.
I'm afraid there are gonna be some limitations on his medical history.
Just let me know what you need and I should be able to provide it.
FYI, my malpractice insurance doesn't cover alien autopsies.
Where was the patient when he first fell ill?
Good Lord.
Very professional.
Cool.
Areflexia doesn't fit as well with...
Does with amyloidosis.
That's even slower than MS. It's lupus.
I'm with the little man on this one.
It's attacking the body and the brain, classic autoimmune.
Flirt all you want, but I should warn you, shiksas are for practice.
Lupus this aggressive wouldn't spare her kidneys.
We're not gonna score any points with House if we solve this just by running your errands.
We've run six complete tox screens, tested for every heavy metal, poison and biological agent we can think of.
Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts, but they taste like a horse's lower than chestnuts, which makes the theory that he accidentally ate a couple of hundred slightly less persuasive.
Seeing as how he was prowling the back alleys of Tehran...
It wasn't Tehran, it was...
You almost got me.
You might as well just Google "poison. "
All they would tell me is he spent the last 11 months in Bolivia.
Who you gonna kill in Bolivia?
My old housekeeper?
We don't kill people.
I'm sorry, who are you gonna marginalize?
If it is my housekeeper, she has it coming.
What does it matter what he was doing?
The guy's dying.
And unless his pancreas is in his fingers...
Spies can't get fungal infections?
And the burns on his skin?
So, either we go with his theory of the non-drinking drunk, or he was poisoned by some group with the resources to make it completely untraceable, some customized isotope.
Let's treat for radiation poisoning.
Should start working in a couple of hours.
We should celebrate with a beer or eight.
I don't drink.
Oh, methinks he doth protest too much.
Guilt over killing a man would make anyone hit the sauce.
That poison lipstick that Ginger used to kiss Gilligan, why didn't that kill her?
Okay, drum roll!
LP is negative for meningitis.
Sorry, Cole.
Protein's 65, glucose, 70.
We're not treating her for two completely separate diseases because you think lupus will win you a prize.
Then why are you here?
Thinks that because he's in charge, he has to prove he's the smartest guy in the room.
All I've heard about you, you put the patient above everything else.
That's why everyone finds you so annoying.
All House cares about is results.
So am I.
Legs hurt?
Vitals stabilizing.
You wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy and hop on the company jet?
Little trip down Mexico way, and I'm not talking about the country or the plane.
Do you think acting like an idiot and talking about sex works on girls?
Well, if it didn't, the human race would have died out long ago.
You're pretty cheery for someone who was just proved wrong about his pancreatitis theory.
I'm appropriately cheery for someone who's been proved right.
John hasn't vomited in six hours.
What's to vomit?
I did unhook your iodine, though.
Didn't seem to fit with the whole "I'm just jerking you guys around" Gestalt.
You're unbelievable.
Let's ask John if he'd rather be sick honestly or cured dishonestly.
Any chance he's just overwhelmed with gratitude?
Paralysis.
It's a new symptom?
I'm not writing it because we can't know if it's a real symptom.
She was also on interferon.
Giving her both probably fried her immune system.
Who knows what infection you could cause...
Given its quick progression, we gotta assume botulism.
I'll go to her place. Check out her fridge and pantry.
There hasn't been a single American case in over 20 years.
So, go find House and tell him your theory.
Take a personal day.
I'll take your book out from under my piano.
What was that for?
Radiation sickness kills specific cells at specific times.
Radiation can cause infections, which set off neuropathy...
If you had any real evidence of foul play, you'd be torturing Bolivians instead of putting me into a state of anticipatory sexual arousal.
I'll arrange for plasmapheresis and chemo.
Are you gonna trust him after what he did?
I don't have to trust him to agree with him.
You make a good point.
I've been wrong every time and she still won't listen to you.
So, either she really likes me or she really hates you.
And I got a ride in the jet.
Just came to say hi.
Hi again.
Where's Mrs. Bearman?
If we gave MRAs to every patient with a headache...
This wasn't just a headache, it was the worst in her life.
And I never had a blueberry bagel, but for the first time I had one.
This taught me a lesson.
I guess when I mess with other people's patients, I risk looking like an officious bitch.
We're gonna have to track down Mrs. Bearman.
For the good of the patient.
I think that for someone who's not involved in his team, you're remarkably involved in his team.
And that's mature.
One-twenty over 80.
Now we got the medical stuff out of the way, why don't we meet back at your place for some enhanced interrogation techniques?
My safe word is, "Help, please, please, stop. "
You actually cure this guy, I'll show you my private water board.
I was wondering when you'd grow bored of avoiding my calls.
Oh, I could never grow bored of ignoring you.
What's the latest protocol on Waldenstrom's?
Where are you?
Either you're sprawled naked on your floor with an empty bottle of Vicodin or collapsed naked in front of your computer with an empty bottle of Viagra.
Please tell me which, because Chase has another pool going.
Damn, I shouldn't have bet on the Viagra.
You know, I happen to have a position available on my penis.
Wait a second, I think I screwed up that joke.
You offering me a job?
I'd settle for that.
As tempting as a position on your staff is, I like it here.
Pays better, and we've only had one assassination attempt.
I have satellite images.
Inspector Gadget?
My God, you're actually at the CIA.
I told them the chances of invasion are slim to none, but...
Waldenstrom's.
Recommended dose is 25 milligrams per meter squared.
House?
She's getting worse.
Her fever's risen slightly.
The anti-toxin hasn't had time to work yet.
I know it's hard, but try to be patient.
Excuse me.
I know you're pissed I interrupted, but you're gonna be even more pissed in a second.
She has polio.
Now what, boss?
Where's House?
He's gonna make up twice his skipped hours in the clinic.
Why are you punishing me worse than him?
How are you feeling?
My hair is falling out.
Is that the chemo?
No, that's too quick.
So, what does it mean?
It means you don't have cancer.
Someone actually did try to kill you.
You may have cost that man his life.
There is no "productive," it's too late!
Because of your inexperience, your poor judgment and your failure to recognize a reckless fool.
Cordyceps sinensis.
Self-recriminations won't help her.
Nothing's gonna help her, she's got polio.
There's no cure, but there are treatments.
Funny how you weren't so depressed when she was just dying because me and Amber screwed up.
And I'm also self-centered, thanks for clarifying.
You wanna throw in some bacon and eggs as well?
If there's anything you learned today, it's gotta be that you can be wrong.
John, can you hear me?
We're gonna start you on an experimental treatment.
Tea?
It's a Chinese herb which has been effective.
I'm dying, aren't I?
Probably.
But we're gonna try.
Don't give up.
Nausea's not as bad.
Wanna know what I really did down there?
Only if it's interesting.
They call it the devil dance.
Not interesting.
I spent the whole 40 days with this attaché to the Minister of Defense.
The most buttoned-down woman you'd ever meet,
except when she did this dance.
She agreed to tell me stuff.
Best way to rid yourself of that guilt is to confess your sins.
It makes me think that somehow it all makes sense.
What do you mean 40 days?
When they found out what she'd told me...
Carnival in Bolivia's only eight days.
You have any idea what a chestnut looks like?
You idiot!
Brazil?
Brazil, on the other hand, has castanhas-do-pára literally, chestnuts from Pára, because it would be stupid for people from Brazil to call them Brazil nuts.
No, he ate a lot of Brazil nuts, which is a big deal, because they contain selenium, which in high doses causes fatigue, vomiting, skin irritation, discharge from the fingernail beds and hair loss.
Any of that sounding familiar?
Can you treat it?
We already started.
Treatment's chelation, the same as for radiation sickness.
The only difference is it works a lot better on nut poisoning.
So, what's the problem?
You're an idiot.
Why is she shivering?
The infusion rate has to remain high for the treatment to work.
Yeah, it hurts.
There's a lot you could learn at my fellowship.
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.
Dr. Curtis, Dr. House.
I appreciate your help.
When you were dying, you tried to infect me, because you knew I'd fight for you if I thought I was dying, too.
I miss people doing whatever it takes to get the job done.
I guess that's why I'm having trouble giving it up.
I shouldn't have helped them mess with your patient.
I don't believe it.
Morning!
I told you, you can't cure polio.
It means either she's not cured or she never had it.
If she had porphyria, you'd have seen purple urine.
You think it's more likely he cured polio?
Well, they believe it.
Some doctor would have to poison her with thallium so it looks like polio, then fake a lab test, then give her vitamin C and stop the poison so she magically gets better.
Actually, it is kind of doable, right?
So, what do you think?
The really shocking thing is that Foreman was right about the heatstroke.
There is no money in finding cures for diseases that only kill poor people.
This will make them do research.
What do you care if I faked a lab test, if it saves a few thousand lives?
Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.
You're gonna quit.
Go on, get out of here.
So, you're just gonna let him go?
Who the hell did I leave in charge?
Where have you been?
And don't say the CIA.
Okay.
By the way, one of my employees...
Either you're gonna have to get someone from the CIA to call and confirm your story, or you're doing eight clinic hours and Wilson is doing 16.
I was in the Hamptons.
I was helping some rich hedge fund jerk treat his son's sniffles.
Fascinating as that sounds.
For your honesty, I will forgive your hours.
Thank you.
No!
The only thing less likely than your helping the CIA is your helping some rich guy in Long Island.
You're doing your hours and Wilson's.
Well, I live a couple of miles from here.
That's not the offer I meant.
I gave notice today.
I'll see you at 9:00 on Monday.
Everyone has their path in life, and this is more or less where mine started.
My name is Norbit Albert Rice, and I was an orphan.
I like to think my parents loved me very much, but just didn't have the means to properly care for me.
I can see them researching all of the orphanages in the area, agonizing over their choices, trying to make sure their precious little boy was raised in the perfect environment.
Can't give these away.
Nobody ever come and say, "Give me the ugly, black one."
A lot of people think that orphanages are cold and scary, but the Golden Wonton was a great place to grow up.
...a big backyard, and lots of kids to play with.
Now all their hair gonna fall out again.
Norbit, how you find family with no hair?
Mr. Wong was a very interesting man.
In addition to his love for children and preparation of fine Asian cuisine, he had a real passion for old-time whaling.
It's a whale, ho!
Norbit, where you go?
Why you run off like little bitch?
After Marvin Browning got lost downtown for a couple of weeks, the orphanage started using a buddy system.
And then one day, Kate and I decided that we should tie the knot.
We got married under the great big oak tree.
I now pronounce you my wife.
And I pronounce you my husband.
It's watermelon.
Yours is green apple.
I think it's time for us to kiss now.
And we lived happily ever after for about two weeks until she got adopted.
I didn't do too much bike riding after that.
When Kate left, there was an odd number of kids at the orphanage, so I was buddyless for a while.
I knew that someday I'd find another somebody to share my life with.
All I had to do was just be patient.
- What'd you do that for?
- Because we felt like it.
That's a stupid name.
- Why'd you beat those boys up?
- Norbit.
Everything changed once I had Rasputia as my girlfriend.
We took care of each other, and the other kids started to respect me.
Rasputia had three brothers.
Leg.
Then, there was Blue.
Breasts.
Wing.
They sure loved their little sister, and so they treated me like one of their own.
The Latimores had a reputation for being the meanest, nastiest people in town, but that's just because folks didn't know them.
They were actually very nice, hard-working people.
It was a surprisingly popular service among the local vendors.
Get his ass in here.
I'm in.
As time passed, Rasputia and I got closer and closer, in high school and as adults.
Of course, it was only natural that Rasputia and I would take the next step in our relationship.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Open your mouth.
Go, Rasputia!
It was a storybook wedding, the beginning of a brand-new chapter.
"Hos, ain't no man gonna pay for the cow if he can get the milk for free."
You ain't got to worry about this brother buying the milk, 'cause he just bought the whole damn cow.
Look like an Escalade in a wedding dress.
Norbit, let me talk to you for a second.
Look, just so we clear.
I'm talking pain, boy.
Searing, mind-numbing pain.
I understand.
Somebody is take a big hunk out of my cake!
What y'all looking at?
I ain't had no cake.
You better mind your damn business.
"One day I find the girl of my dreams." And then you marry a gorilla.
I joke, I joke, I joke.
Why you not know joke when you hear joke?
Why you wanna make fight at wedding?
And Norbit, when he was just little boy, had a pee-pee the size of an egg roll.
And one day, down by creek, Norbit run around naked and poisonous snake jump up and bite Norbit right on ass.
Very close to hole.
"Okay," I say, "I must do something to save child."
I do the most responsible thing.
I say, "Hell to the no!
But strange, mystical thing happen, Norbit.
Even though poison is in Norbit, he not die.
Norbit get stronger and stronger.
That why I know, Norbit, deep down inside, you very, very strong.
That's why I say to you, Norbit, you can survive anything.
Put your back into it.
Rasputia was so full of love.
Merry Christmas!
And it's still going strong.
Happy Presidents' Day!
God bless America.
And so, we began our life together, like any other happily married couple.
Morning, Rasputia.
"Morning, Rasputia," my ass.
Messing around with you, now I'm gonna be late for dance class.
It looks like it's back as far as it goes, Rasputia.
You see that?
That scientifically prove that you was adjusting my seat.
Why you think I want to sell Golden Wonton Restaurant?
I got a good business.
And here is my counteroffer.
Ling Ling, get my pistol!
We gonna palpitate!
Hey, you get your skinny ass out of my way.
Goddamn, girl, that look like the harvest moon.
I could do private lessons if you could do me a little favor.
Just need you talk to your little brothers about funding my little video tape.
I'm trying to make power-tap more international.
I'm trying to be like Billy Blanks, but double the money and half the Blank.
That's a good idea.
Because here come Norbit, right on schedule.
Almost set your watch to him.
Hey, Pope Sweet Jesus and Lord Have Mercy.
How you guys doing, fellows?
What do you mean, "the good old days"?
The good old days, man, back when we was pimping, Norbit.
Rasputia sent me down here to get the usual.
Can you get King Kong three large buckets, extra sauce?
Norbit, while I got your attention, can I interest you in some new shoes, maybe a haircut?
Why don't you take these little tater puffs over there to them little children?
What's Rasputia doing home so early?
- You're Rasputia's tap dance teacher.
- Man, actually, I'm her power-tap guru.
I was just here giving her a little tap lesson.
But you're naked.
That's just so she could see the various muscle groups as I go through the various routines.
And you have an...
Oh, man, I'm just real passionate about dance.
Norbit, Buster's a guest in our home.
How dare you insinuate something like that?
You know, I am actually offended by your accusization, you understand?
You happy now?
Rasputia, you cheated on me!
Rasputia, we took vows, and you cheated on me!
It never happened!
Yes, it did!
And that makes you the queen of whores!
Run for your lives!
That's what your stupid black ass get!
I hope you broke your ass!
All this setting you straight done got me famished.
I'm Little Red Riding Goose, walking through the forest, minding my own business, when all at once...
- I'm the big, bad pig of the forest.
My, what big eyes you have, Pig.
The better to see you with, Goose.
And my, what a big nose you have, Pig.
The better to smell them scrumptious goodies you got in your basket.
Hey, let me take a look in there.
No, I won't steal your food.
Don't let that pig push you around, Goose.
Yeah, I'm tired of you pushing me around.
Look, I'm tired of playing with your ass, bitch.
Or better still, why don't you just call Buster and tell him to come over and power-tap you, because in addition to being the pig of the forest, you're also a saddle tramp, whore, bitch pig...
This supposed to be a childrers show.
This remind me of Chinese snuff film I once co-star in.
Well, can I have a hug?
It just like old times.
Maybe you two go take poop together.
This place has not changed at all.
So, how long are you gonna be visiting for?
I sold my clothing business in Atlanta, and I'm going to use the money to buy the orphanage.
You know, it's always been my dream to come back here and take over.
That's great.
Norbit, look.
That's the tree we got married under.
You know, I've still got my ring.
I ate mine.
I missed you so much when you left.
I missed you, too.
That's my car.
We didn't really get a chance to catch up much.
Yeah, I would love to have lunch on Tuesday.
I'll see you Tuesday.
Tuesday.
Say "Tuesday" again and you ain't gonna see Wednesday!
Yeah, I'm on my way out now.
Tuesday.
What's wrong with your boy?
He real cool all of a sudden.
Yeah, I don't know what the hell got into him, but I know I got dance fever.
Ready for a little power-tap, huh?
Lord, give me strength.
Norbit, this is my fiance, Deion Hughes.
Now she and I are buddy partners.
She worked too hard for this money, man, you know what I mean?
Deion, you take such good care of me, baby.
Don't you just love Tuesdays?
Lloyd, just tell me why it has to hurt so GD much.
What's the matter, boy?
You sensing an earthquake or some other sort of natural disaster?
A man needs his own space.
Nobody touched your old, stupid seat.
Then how come it's all mushed up like this, then?
How you doing?
Look at that dog over there, eyeballing me.
I know what that sound means! I know what that sound means!
Enough is enough.
Now, where in the hell do you think you're going?
Lloyd's in the hospital because of you!
Rasputia, you are a mean, selfish, cold, heartless woman, and I am leaving you!
Well, where the hell you think you're going, big shot?
And my titties is all achy and itchy-like.
Oh, Norbit, we gonna be a family.
Oh, Norbit, come hug me, Daddy, please.
I understand, little pony.
I know your pain.
Oh, yes, I know.
Call it what you will, but Pope Sweet Jesus is taking half.
Hey, this is not a financial decision, Deion.
He had some business to take care of.
So, who are you here with?
My wife.
So, where is she?
Right over there in the print outfit.
The one talking to the girl by the bench?
No, the one sucking the jelly out of them donuts.
I don't want you bothering anyone.
Oh, I just thought 'cause you're married to Norbit...
Who the hell are you?
Kate, this is my wife, Rasputia Latimore, and, Rasputia, this is Kate.
Latimore, as in Latimore Construction?
You thinking about creeping, ain't you?
We're just friends.
What'd I tell you about having friends?
Are you Big Black Jack?
What it look like?
The orphanage is in play.
It's raining little white women.
My prayers have been answered!
She'd better move, 'cause my prayer is for a Cadillac.
You little bastards.
Bitch, that's my wine cooler!
I'm good, but how about you and your head?
Oh, I'm doing better.
The doctor said if it werert for my hard Afro, it could have killed me.
Are you sure you're okay, Norbit?
Well, I don't know about this stuff, but 110 beats per minute, that's kind of high. 120...
Oh, my goodness, 130!
And we run this town.
Your woman was telling us how y'all was planning on buying the orphanage.
Kate has her plans and I have mine.
Well, it looks like the only plans you got, my man, is leaving.
I ain't sticking around raising no damn orphans.
I got kids of my own I ain't even bringing up.
So, you was just hustling her?
That orphanage she buying, that's a huge property, outside of town, zoned commercial.
It's a perfect place for a titty bar.
We got it all worked out.
We gonna call it Nipplopolis.
Shit got a ring to it, don't it?
We talking about overpriced, watered-down alcohol and fake tig old bitties in abundance.
And what about Kate?
If you marry her, it's as much yours as hers.
Norbit, I really want you to be a part of the orphanage.
The kids are crazy about you.
You know, I'm gonna take them bike riding tomorrow, down by the lake.
Why don't you come?
I don't know if I could go for a bike ride.
I can't ride a bike still.
The kids have been begging me to take them there.
Oh, I don't know about the water park.
Yeah, I know, but it's the park and it's watery, and there's a potential hell to pay if I were to be there maybe...
Hey, what are you doing with those things, Kate?
Well, I'm just going to have to shock you till you say yes.
I just wanted to do something special for you, you know, from the heart.
Well, I am feeling it.
You're serious?
Where the hell you going?
Little Miss Skinny Bitch gonna be there?
You mean Miss Ling Ling?
A girl, she had the foreign name.
Great.
All right, kids, everybody please be nice to Mrs. Latimore, okay?
Well, are we gonna stand around here all day or we gonna go inside?
Are you wearing bottoms?
Of course I'm wearing bottoms!
How dare you?
This ain't like no real beach, 'cause on a real beach you got people walking around with ice chests and you can get all kinds of treats like sandwiches and potato chips and Mentos and Skittles and all sorts of delectables.
You going?
No, I already ate.
Well, you could have fooled me.
My Norbit is always telling me there's two kinds of women, big old good ones and good old big ones.
He is the biggest freak you ever wanna meet and he be blowing my back out, trying to put me through the headboard every night.
Miss Thomas, we're all going off the Leap of Doom.
Especially for us skinny folk.
So, Norbit, I have some news.
Deion and I decided to move up the wedding.
What wedding?
Our wedding.
We're going to get married on Saturday.
You're getting married on Saturday?
Yeah, we just figured, "Why wait?" You know?
Oh, so am I. It's wonderful.
So, there it is, the Leap of Doom.
Okay, kids, one at a time.
I guess this is me.
What are you looking at, Norbit?
That was awesome.
What's that?
It's Rasputia.
I'm gonna show you how a bitch go down a slide.
How you doing?
Why does she have to go and get married, Lloyd?
Things were going so well.
There it is.
And the blood clot.
Nothing.
Latimore Construction, Norbit speaking.
Rasputia, I'm just loaded up with paperwork up to my ear.
I was wondering, could you run these permits downtown for me?
Now you tell me what in the hell I look like, running some goddamn permits down to City Hall for your ass.
I know you don't think I'm gonna get on that thing.
And the mailbox.
You know damn well you clean up all the vomit.
The Portosans at Drummond's tipped over!
Well, go clean the shit up!
You do it!
So, I'm going to Giovanni's tonight to choose the food for the reception.
What about Deion?
I just don't trust him with food.
- Well, I'll go.
Okay, that's great.
You guys are all pervs.
I love it.
What's wrong?
Are you sure we're not rushing things?
Norbit, that's a date.
Are you paying for this encounter this evening?
Well, who are you getting all fine for?
Oh, I'm just, you know, being a girl.
My fiance likes it when I take care of myself.
Look to me like that fish already in his net.
You look like you fixing to catch you a new fish.
Here I come, girl.
You just make sure all that sprucing up is for your fiance.
Here we go, dear.
What's up?
Everything on schedule with the wedding?
I got my own problems, but I'll handle it.
What's this situation you're talking about?
Yeah, and getting a new license could take years.
Yeah, we'd be out of business before we get started.
You think you can get Kate to sign that?
It'd raise too many suspicions.
All right, smart-ass, then what we gonna do now?
Guys, I told Rasputia the toilet needed to be reinforced and she said that I should take care of it, so I'm gonna go take care of that.
That's right, punk ass.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Now, that's pimping.
All right, hair's bigger.
Thanks for making me fly.
You fly like a flock of birds, baby.
I just picked these on the side of the road, 'cause this is just a casual get-together.
You dressed to kill, huh?
I'm making my specialty just for you.
I'm gonna take the flowers, put them into water, okay?
He's a nice man.
Your favorite?
I guess you and Rasputia come here a lot, huh?
To old friends.
I tell you, you know, sometimes I think I should've never married Rasputia.
I was just really young, you know, and she latched on to me and kind of helped me fit in and gave me a family, so...
We had nobody, Norbit.
I mean, who can blame us for wanting to feel safe, you know?
Like you and Deion?
I mean, it's different with Deion, obviously.
So, what have you got here?
Those are just construction papers, permits and stuff that you have to sign.
Kate, can I ask you a personal question?
Do you love Deion?
Otherwise, why would I be marrying him, right?
I'm about to disappear up in here I'm so hungry.
- Why you looking at me like that?
I don't know nothing.
I don't know nothing, okay?
He's on a date with that fine skinny girl!
He got me destroying my shit.
This is it.
It's always so beautiful in here.
Peaceful.
At which point you'll give your vows to Deion.
You want to practice those?
Well, I hadrt actually gotten to that quite yet.
You don't even know what you're gonna say yet?
Well, what would you say, Norbit?
What would I say?
I guess...
And when I'm not near you, all I think about is being near you.
And the only thing I really wanna do is just spend the rest of my life making you as happy as you've made me.
Because I love you, Kate.
I love you.
Damn it!
I'm cursing again.
I'm just too confused right now.
I wanted you to.
That's why I'm so confused.
Good night.
She wanted me to.
- Where the papers at, Norbit?
- Got them for you right here.
I'd hate to be you right now.
Chocolate drop, I'm home.
Lollipop?
Expecting a letter, Norbit?
How was your date?
Oh, really?
Lloyd, what am I gonna do?
Kill the bitch.
You know what it's like to be a dog with no legs?
I can't raise one up to pee.
What is this, Norbit?
Some kind of weird, satanic potato art?
What's this?
And, Norbit, if you ever see her again, if you ever talk to her again, if you ever so much as think about the bitch again, this is what's gonna happen to her.
How you doing?
You get the picture, Norbit?
Oh, good, you're up.
I was just at Latimore Construction, you know, with the renovation plans, and I found this on Big Black's desk.
What is it?
It's a request to renew the Golden Wontors liquor license and put it in the Latimores' name.
What?
Just some permits that Norbit gave me, but...
Well, did you read them?
Why would the Latimores want me to renew the liquor license at the orphanage?
Baby, people say they've been trying to get their hands on that orphanage for years.
Apparently they want to turn it into a strip joint.
Disgusting.
First you gonna clean the basement, then you gonna clean the garage, then you gonna go upstairs and clean the attic.
We don't even have an attic.
I need to talk to you.
Do you know what was in those papers you had me sign last night?
Yeah, the construction permits.
No, that's not all.
Well, why don't you go and find somebody who gives a rat's ass, because I sure as hell don't!
But last night...
Last night I was just trying to nail you, you know, score?
She's all the woman I need, so you can just go on and get out of here, you screwy dame!
He been setting you up from that moment from the very first day you got here.
How you doing?
Don't you ever talk to me again!
Never again!
Mr. Wong, what are you doing around here?
Soon I be moving on.
I could make killing.
Why you got suitcase?
I thought you stick around, help Kate run orphanage.
She's getting married to Deion tomorrow, so there's no reason for me to stay around here.
And besides, I'll just wind up getting hurt again.
I love you like my own child, like boy child, not girl child.
Wong once have girl child back in Shanghai.
When she two years old, I trade her for yak.
That sort of thing happen in China from time to time.
Yak very hard to come by.
You can't run from your problems, Norbit.
Black people run fast, but problem even faster.
That's kind of racist.
Always remember two things, Norbit.
One, even though you're very ugly, you're very strong inside, like warrior.
And two, mail come late on Friday.
I gotta warn Kate.
Going somewhere, Norbit?
I was just going to get some fresh air.
Boy, you ain't going nowhere till after that wedding's done.
We got too much riding on that.
What do you have riding on the wedding?
But what about the little orphans?
Hell, they can come too, if they pay the cover.
John the Baptist, stop their evil plan.
Because everybody know you the smartest.
What are the Latimores doing here?
Your ass is mine, Norbit!
Just calm down, Mr. Wong.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these two in holy matrimony.
Your Honor, I object!
Then I'm objeculating prematurely, Reverend.
No offense, my brother, but we're just trying to keep the train rolling here.
Lesbians.
Love is the engine that drives the train forward, backwards, side to side, round and round love does go.
I'm not talking about no $20 up in here, back seat of the car, stanky-stanky, hanky-panky.
How much it cost?
Where the hell you going, Norbit?
Oh, yes, I can, because Kate taught me!
Buy one Pimp Platter, get the whole bones free.
It's time to get back to the wedding.
It ain't never enough talking when you talking about love, brother.
Drive the car, God damn it!
What's up, white man?
That's enough!
Oh, for Christ's sake!
This wedding is a sham and I'm here to stop it.
Norbit, what are you doing?
What the hell did you just say?
And the last two weeks I spent with you have meant more to me than my whole entire miserable life with you, Rasputia!
No, no, wait, baby girl, he's ruining our wedding.
He's been married four times in the last six years to four different women, and he cheated the women out of $300,000 in divorce settlements.
Pathetic.
Kate, you have to believe me.
Yeah, yeah, believe him, Kate.
Remember the one that got you to sign the papers to steal the orphanage?
Yeah, I thought you'd feel that way about it, Kate.
And that's why I took the liberty of inviting some of Deiors ex-wives down so maybe they could tell you for themselves.
Ladies!
Hello, Antoine.
You going somewhere, Norbit?
Go back to your shop, Abe, before I kill you, too!
Yeah, and me, too!
I kick the shit out of you.
Bring it, bitches!
Get out of the way.
His ass is mine.
You remember "till death do us part," don't you, Norbit?
Whale, ho!
Come here.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
In the end, I guess you could say everything worked out just fine.
Kate and I took over the orphanage and it was a dream come true.
And I now pronounce you my wife.
And I pronounce you my husband.
You may kiss the bride.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
As for Rasputia and the rest of the Latimores, we never heard from them again.
Rumor has it they settled somewhere in Mexico and opened the club.
I guess they're living their dream, too.
Say, man, don't you have any better-Iooking girls than that?
Our best girl's coming out right now.
Sarah, run away.
Good morning.
How can I help you?
Allow me here to start.
How long are you off?
A few days until Sunday.
With a reasonable pace, you get the top tomorrow.
Is there a recommended path?
- No, something like this never.
For novices, I recommend Willow Creek to or Donner path.
We monitor those routes.
If you lost another route, it may take we find for you.
You can find a few people ...
- Many people live here?
A few generations of families as these mountains their home.
Do you have a first aid kit?
Thank you
Are you receiving?
If we have a problem, I prefer a phone to me, that does not work, than no phone.
Are you ready?
Hey, Einstein, we will leave the tent here, or will we take him?
I just wanted to check or you attention.
I wear this.
And what does that mean?
The guide indicates that the paths have beautiful views.
Good morning.
Have you people help?
We consider our network route options.
Never mind, you can not choose wrong.
I think Sam only those two know.
What do you think?
It is certainly not a traditional wedding, but God has the same meaning.
- We are not married.
Sorry.
I got the ring of my father, then graduated.
That sounds perfect.
But I'll let you decide.
You have no one like me need you time.
If I see an opportunity ...
We go to Timber Falls.
Who are Lewis and Clark actually?
You know no more, when you gave me.
February 27, 2006.
What are you good.
Hey Lonnie, Brody, look at this.
It seems ... whether a party is.
No, man, no party.
It is always easy, for city people to recognize.
They try to be nice, but if they do not.
What you found, you may keep.
Where are you going?
We just know each other.
Something you have never tasted, huh.
Or maybe we can ... do a barter.
Okay, I grab my wallet.
That's a good idea.
$ 50 seems a bargain.
Pay the man.
This is yours.
Excuse me.
Throw the ball away and when we come home, you throw that gun away.
Please.
Thank you.
The previous week, we had heavy rain showers and there are trees and branches broken off.
One of the newcomers This was yesterday, but ... you know how that goes, if you make good want, you can do better.
It is okay, but we thought that this route was not patrolled.
Right, that normally happens, but this is one of my favorite places.
You need me to believe look for yourself.
What city, Charleston?
If Charleston is, I understand you.
The smell there feet.
That place is not for me, you do?
We live in Alexandria, lying in DC.
There are many beautiful churches, I remember.
At this moment no one.
The sun sets and the path He was not free, so ...
Excuse me, sir.
My name is Clyde.
Clyde, you know a place where we are tonight can camp?
Yes, tell me that you like.
I think Five Corners will be perfect.
Just follow this path, It is a beautiful lake.
That is part of the work.
Have a nice time and care to.
Unbelievable.
- Yes, beautiful.
The Ranger said, that close to one more.
I would have to commit a murder.
Let's wait until tomorrow.
You know what you're doing?
No, you still see it.
You know what this evening would make perfect?
'Moonshine'.
What do you want?
I want sex with you.
That's not really Christian.
- I am for the Old Testament.
And ... what does that mean?
I have no idea but I think that the worst is of the two books.
I liked it, what that woman said about us.
What they said about us?
They thought that we were married.
I would not really his girlfriend, I do not occasionally would tease.
Sorry, that was not me.
Where are you going?
The fire part.
Damn.
What is it?
Where is she?
Calm down, man.
You killed her towel Where is she?
I swear.
I thought that you had in you, city kid.
Too bad you lost your piece.
Help.
Michael, can you hear me?
Look who's awake.
Where am I?
In my house, Michael.
You scared me.
I thought that I had lost you.
This will not comfort you now, but believe me, that's a good thing.
Excuse me.
This old terminal is a source of infection, so we have to wound cleaning, right?
Try to relax.
You do not thank me.
We are here for each other, the only way we can survive.
Sorry, but I know your name.
Earth, what am I a bad score geefster, my name is lda.
It is not about me, but my girlfriend, Sheryl.
You've met her yesterday.
We need someone to call the Rangers, we must find her.
Because that is the question.
If we are ready, okay?
Bite it.
It is over.
Look.
We will primulas to do then you again as good as new.
Of course, I care for it.
What took so long?
What do you, Brody?
I am looking for a tourist.
Is he alone?
Excuse me, I have seen no one for days.
Why are you looking for him?
He worked Darryl's face with a rifle.
If you see someone, you do not know light in me.
Of course.
Well.
He is gone.
Brody and his boys suits.
This cousin of his, it had earned.
Excuse me, I could reach anyone.
Goddamn.
Please ... abuse the name of God in this house.
Excuse me.
Drink this.
They are on patrol and so will be back.
We try again to reach and then we find Sheryl.
That happens a lot more.
Only my grandmother, who is dead, called me Michael.
How would I need to know your name?
On my license and credit card, the name Michael.
If you my wallet have stolen from the campsite, would you know.
Accuse me of the steal your wallet?
I saved your life twice.
Drink your primulas.
Where are you going?
- I own the Ranger calls.
I go in that room.
I can not let you.
You are all sinners right.
I saw your last night, you spuugden God in the face and its laws, indulgent to the sins of meat.
You and your whore girlfriend will pay for your sins.
Is everything okay?
Is everything okay?
I must get something release it to you, okay.
Is it?
Sheryl, run away.
Help!
You see, there is none.
What is wrong?
How can you let her escape, Deacon?
If you want something well done, you must do.
It's almost time.
By the power entrusted to me, I declare you husband and wife.
Why are you doing this?
We have you done nothing.
You may now kiss the bride.
You bastards are sick.
Skip never another language, in this house.
Now kiss the bride, he cut her lips off.
I love you.
I know.
Please, let us go.
How well do you know the Bible, Michael?
I said you had careful with that language.
Get the clothes.
Have you enough?
Okay.
Not very good.
I will tell you a story, about Judas.
Supposedly he now next to the Devil, with forever in hell burning soul, because of this sin.
But I have my own theory.
I can not believe that Judas wanted, you do?
Deacon, go to her.
Forward, out of here, go.
That I'm sorry, honey.
My brother is not healthy.
This is not only his fault.
I have spoken with him and others is over, will not happen to you.
Son, you're in trouble.
You and Sheryl are sinners, in the eyes of the Lord.
But me and Ida, give you an opportunity, to save your souls and correct life.
Drink the tea.
I almost forgot to call how does it feel to be married?
Why are you doing this?
I thought that you would be happy.
Everything I wanted in my life, was married and a baby.
The Lord blessed me with Clyde, but the children is a problem.
She soon becomes pregnant, but they do not get the end.
This city had some strange doctor ideas about his condition.
That woman is a born mother.
What exactly do you want from us?
For you will be easier.
Honey?
What did you do to her?
They will have a few hours sleep, but she is okay.
Here you have some water.
Ida is in a few hours back and checks to see whether you have done.
If that is not the case, will your little girl, if you see her, part missing set us on the test.
View it.
Just do your best every time and the miracle take place.
Are you really crazy?
What was I talking about that language?
Deacon will be outside, for the door.
This is the only door there are no windows.
Well, we'll let you come alone.
I was almost forgotten.
Sheryl, honey, wake up.
Sheryl, come.
Did you know what you expected?
Yes, but how do you expect ...
Yes, when sex was a sin, it was okay, but now she is your wife, it is sick?
Unbelievable.
I had warned you.
Where is Mike?
What do you do with him?
Make sure you prefer, about what will happen to you.
What are you doing?
You do not have to do.
With your excellent schools and nice jobs and stuff.
I see it in your eyes, honey.
You will be surprised but I was an excellent student.
Always tienen.
Except for science and all that nonsense about Darwin.
I ontstak in anger, explanation on how they gave, the creations of God.
I think Mr. Billings and Mr. Darwin will be welcomed, because you girl, will evolve.
Wait, wait.
Ida, please, do not.
Do you think that I great job as you, pain would like to do?
However, if you and your husband not obey, my hands are tied.
There are many women that a baby can not express.
I understand your pain.
You know nothing of me, or what I witnessed.
Wait.
You are helped by the rules.
- Good morning, Brody.
I was last in your house.
Have you seen or heard something, about those tourists?
Yes, now you say, I saw him and his girlfriend go.
And when was that?
Yesterday evening, at dusk, I thought.
Nonsense.
You may believe what you want.
Maybe this morning then the car is now no more.
Let my arm loose, Brody.
What do you know that tourists, you tell me?
I said a moment ago, I saw them leave.
How do you think I should do?
Wil you some extra motivation for us?
You do not want to, you have lovely bride suffering through a day like today?
You will not get away.
We have friends, family, they will come looking for us, they know where we are, they find us.
Perhaps ... but your car will not be found.
Are they gone?
This mess is me huge bang.
Everything is good.
What should we do?
I do not know.
Reasons enough for them no child to give.
I do not talk about sin, I am so sinful as pie.
I get us here, I promise you.
Well.
Goei Demo gene, Sam.
Today is no different as different, So, wipe that smile off your face.
The mother of that girl this morning has been three times, she says that she no longer her daughter has heard.
She is yesterday and today nor her work published.
They certainly knew that she wanted to park?
- Yes, she has a reward be offered.
It is time.
Clyde, Evelyn here, please reply.
Stop the drugs away.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
You are nothing, than a cold forceps.
I was wondering whether you guys a few walkers have seen the last days?
What is this about?
Why, have you seen them?
Have you already talked about Clyde?
How much?
I do not know exactly I think a reasonable amount.
Lonnie and I will look at them.
Lonnie in the car.
I know it yet, which Deacon, there seems to kick.
Look, I mean it now.
The disobedience, the curse.
The sooner you give us what we want the less you will and your wife something.
So if I see it, did you find us alive.
The park staff and the police looking for us, you panicked.
Your whole plan is in tatters.
So stop with that sucks rod in fire prod, to make me afraid, because it does you.
You are just a bunch fucking sick freaks.
What was that?
Get off her.
Okay, it starts from the hand.
The longer your business slows down, the more risk that something happens.
Deacon I just turned away.
He knows, that he has done something wrong.
Everything you need to do your marital obligations to fulfill than I love him from the neighborhood.
Because you a couple fucking monsters, not baby deserve?
Take that back.
What brave.
I torture her.
Or perhaps we shall trimming.
Everything we need is the brains, the heart and uterus.
She has no fingers needed.
She has toes not required.
I can cut her eye.
So, you give me my baby?
I'll tell a damn joke, I'm already pregnant.
Eight weeks, since yesterday.
I tried a good time to find to tell.
Lijster shit.
What are you doing?
What the hell?
Help, we are here.
Ida, you know, what needs to be done.
Clyde no, I get her an abortion.
We can do her pregnant leave and everything is good.
Abortion?
No, we do not.
There will be many people searching.
We must do so, that they never found.
Believe me, Clyde, I understand the particular situation, but there is a criminal be distributed.
One down.
What is it?
Burn in hell, Michael.
I tried to save your soul, I tried to save you.
The walkietalkie of Clyde, search him and call the Rangers Post.
Go ahead.
Is there someone who can help us?
You did it, you saved me.
I love you.
Bunch of idiots.
Come on, Mike, are fighting.
I will be framed for murder...
Who the hell are you people ?
My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.
I know all this because I am living the same day, over and over again.
The day is the same, but different things happen.
We taste the same!
We all taste just like chicken!
Every day I get another chance.
For every decision, there's a consequence.
Before he died, Garza sent me evidence for an old murder case, one my father worked on.
This girl can lead me to the truth.
Mr. Detweiler got Isabella the job.
And I thought I found the guy behind it.
I wanna know why the hell you're doing this to me.
But he works for someone else.
I don't know who, but I have his license plate.
How the hell shall I proceed?
Kill them all.
Now, I have to find out who he is.
Somebody's tense.
Scratch your face.
Are you growing a beard or something?
No, I guess I haven't had time to shave.
I thought you shaved it yesterday.
What happened, here?
Nothing.
Did I say something wrong?
Sometimes, I just can't take the same questions, you know ?
Baby, what's going on with you?
Come on, tell me.
You wanna tell me about it?
What's going on?
Why is this happening?
- What, like... with us?
- With everything.
Well, last time I checked, I'm part of everything.
And I don't know who is he, what he looks like and I don't know his name.
All I got is a licence plate number.
But it's not you.
This is something I gotta figure out by myself.
He knows much more than he's letting off.
Oh yes, this is Detective Choi.
I need you to run a licence plate for me, please.
1-E-4-9-9-0-8.
Do you have an address on that?
- Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
- Deliveries are around back.
Let's do this one more time.
I have a question.
Those cars out front, who uses them?
All of the cars are licenced to the Santayana Club for the exclusive use of our members.
Well, I'm interested in Conrad Detweiler.
Who drives him?
This is a private club, sir.
The director of operations handles all tranportation matters.
If you'll excuse me.
Punk!
Excuse me, sir.
Lloyd, please.
Do that and your first drink's on me.
Director's office is to the left.
I hope not.
Soltis, hallway is clear.
I don't see this guy anywhere.
Excuse me, what are you doing in here?
Sir, I'm detective Brett Hopper.
- If you have a moment, I'd like--
- I'm so sorry, detective.
You are in the wrong place, everyone else is upstairs in the dinner room.
Did you see anyone else in my office?
No, should I have?
Everything this morning has been so unexpected.
You never know what you're gonna wake up to.
It's him.
That's the man that killed my husband.
Stay with Mrs Garza.
The uniforms come with me!
Emergency exit is that way.
We all taste just like chicken!
That was different.
It's you!
You okay?
I take your call again!
Stop running now!
Hey, that's our guy, get him!
- Spivak.
- Mrs Garza IDed Hopper.
She did that last night, dude.
No, she did it in person.
Hopper was here, at the club.
- What he was doing there?
- I didn't have time to ask.
Look, he got away but we have his truck so he's not going far.
Do you think Hopper wanted to get to her?
She's the only eye witness.
What do you think?
Already on it.
So is Shelten getting his back waxed in there or what?
The sergeant will see you when he's ready.
Just saying I got a Vietnamese girl who can get him speed already in under 20 minutes.
What?
You haven't eard yet, have you?
Heard what?
About your partner...
You know Hopper's wanted for de Garza's murder, right?
What are you talking about?
What murder?
You got to get that?
Come on, come on.
If they think by keeping me here all day, that's gonna change my story, they're wrong.
There's no way he could have killed anyone.
I know...
From who?
- Who is that?
- This none of your damned business.
- What's this?
Police business, I need this laptop.
Sit down!
There you are...
Now let's see who you hang out with.
Don't !
Trust me, you don't wanna be found dead, man.
How did you guys manage to find me without your little tracking device ?
Let me guess, now we're gonna take a little trip to the quarry to visit Detweiler.
Oh aren't you the shady paddy?
Don't even think about...
Believe me, you don't wanna know.
What if other people wanna know?
Their hust saying you tried to kill Ms Garza at some club...
I went looking for a list of suspects of people who framed me, Andrea.
Word is, you killed two ex-deputies.
What?
You said they were two ex-cops?
Focus, Hopper!
Tell me what happened.
They threatened me, but I did not shoot them.
Well, who the hell did?
There was someone on the top of the building on the roof top.
So now you've got a garding angel with a snipe rifle.
Do you hear yourself?
Did you call to give me a hard time or to help me out?
We need to talk.
Just charged it...
Why are you doing this to me?
Here you go.
Chad, I told you I'm not hungry.
Come on, we could be here a while.
You got to keep your strength out.
I did some asking around, it turns out that's Garza's wife.
What?
- Yeah, the one Hopper whacked.
Sorry.
Word is, she's homicide ace in the hall.
Says she saw Hopper do the deed.
Kill the lights.
I got blood.
Looks like somebody forgot to go to the cleaners.
What?
Leave the room, guys.
Don't ever question a case in front of anyone else.
Even the smart ones, especially the smart ones.
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
Listen, now I know they're telling you all sorts of things about me.
- What shirt?
Baby.
Did somebody gets to you?
Brett, we can get you helped.
I mean it's best for everyone.
- Yeah, I got to go.
DAY 2 (del vo)
Did I say something wrong?
Are you even listening?
- Sorry, what?
- What is it with you, Brett?
You woke up and made conversation to dump out a hamper.
It's not your fault, I just...
In 20 seconds that phone is gonna ring and it's gonna be Andrea.
She's gonna call and tell me that she's taking Eddie to rehad because he started using again.
Now, at first Eddie was killed, but then I changed the day.
Hey, Andrea.
You're totaly freaking me out.
I see you...
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be in here.
- Why the hell are you following me?
- I'm always here!
You're the new guy, I'm here every day.
- "I'm here every day"?
- I mean today.
Only a different "today".
- It's always today!
You're happy?
Say that again.
I know how it sounds.
I've to get back to work.
Director dude's gonna show up and there isn't much time.
Do you recognize me?
I don't know.
- Should I?
- Come on, man.
It's important.
Because the same thing is happening to me too.
Very funny.
You make fun of the cripple kid.
You want my lunch money?
I'm not joking, you've seen me before, haven't you?
At the police station.
It's the same for me too.
I wake up in the same place, same time same damn bird, same damn Dodger game!
The Dodgers...
- Do they win?
- Yes.
They rally in the bottom of the neith.
Finally!
It's okay.
He is a very close fan of mister Garza.
He just heard what happened, sorry man.
Of course, I... just need to get my day planner.
Just give us a minute, please!
Of course.
Come on, we got to get out of here man, too many cops around.
But I'm not finished!
Finished with what?
It's a membership list.
The man who took my brother belongs to this club.
But I've been coming here everyday, trying to find the guy that did it.
What's his name?
So you just come here everyday and hope he just shows up?
No, I've got a plan, I'm not an idiot!
I'm memorizing the membership list
Names, addresses, the whole enchilada!
I'm already up to the end of this.
Here a better plan.
- Mr. Summer?
- I know this is a delicate situation.
And I'm pleased the club can offer our members a safe respite in their time of need.
Your point.
We have an extremely demanding membership.
I cannot afford having one of your detectives coming into my office.
Our people are all here in this room.
Show me.
I didn't have this.
I don't know anymore.
How about you?
Three weeks.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me...
Open every door, every closet, every bathroom stall.
I hate that.
Happens a lot.
Especially after they sticked me with that needle.
They stick you with a needle?
Yeah.
That's were they grabbed my brother.
I'm telling that there is a conspiracy going on here.
Detweiler, he is the one who injected me.
He's only a middle mouse, man, but I want the man on top.
You think that we're both looking for the same guy?
If I'm right, his name is right here.
Give me the key of that door.
This is so great.
Ok, it's just... nice not to be alone.
Alright, come here.
You gotta stay right here.
- What's your name?
- Like the painter, that's cool.
Do you have any idea why this is happening?
No, and i don't know how to make it stop.
How did you, like, handle it?
The only way I know how, be a cop.
How do you manage to do those things in pen?
Maybe... you can help me with something, though.
73 across.
The emergency exit is that way.
Get in man, get in.
M. Colburn, Detective Brett Hopper.
Go.
Hey, drive !
You're the one the cops are after for the Garza murder.
How do you know that ?
Actually I'm being framed by members of your club.
It's a very serious charge.
That's why I need a good lawyer to help me prove it.
You got in because you need a quick get away
My retainers starts at $30000
How is an honest cops supposed to come up with cash like that?
You are now protected on the attorney-client privilege.
What about your fee?
Oh, I can make ten times that on the book too.
Let's go to my office.
So you telling me you were with Hopper all night.
He went to bed with me, he woke up next me.
I don't know how to be any clearer.
I appreciate that and I wanna believe you, really.
- That's not relevent.
- I was hoping you might have learned a few things since 2002 like telling the truth.
I said she's done talking to you.
This is a homicide investigation.
Come on.
They're just bluffing.
Don't worry about it, I took care of it.
This is Jared Pryor.
He claims he was with Hopper this morning.
- The same ?
Can you tell us why you and Detective Hopper were at the Santayana club ?
- Who's that ?
- Do you know where Hopper is now ?
Sure.
Now as my lawyer, you have full access to the evidence against me, right ?
Well, we're get into that.
But first, there are a few ground rules.
Don't talk to anyone about the case.
No wives, girlfriends, that could make them potential witnesses in a trial.
And don't talk to the press about anything.
Do you have a publicist?
All right, I could recommend one for you.
This hourglass was found next to a dead body.
Now you got 3 minutes, start talking.
Tell me about this hourglass.
- Who else has one?
- Everyone on the board.
- What board?
- I can't tell you if I can't breathe.
The Santayana board of directors.
Every member of the board past and present, gets an hourglass when they're voted in.
Would you mind telling me what is so important about a damn hourglass?
It's the second one I've seen just like it.
- The 1st was sent to me by Garza.
- But you said you didn't know him.
I never event met the guy.
Isabella Contreras.
I think she worked at your club and was killed by one of your members.
What has an old murder case have to do with Garza?
I don't know but it's all connected to this club.
That's why you saw me there, I was after this.
- A list of members.
- And you suspect them, don't you?
Yeah, one or more of these men is a killer.
If you're right, and I hardly doubt that you are, you've narrowed it down to the 400 of the richest most powerful people in the city.
How many of them are on the board of the directors?
- Who are they?
- You really want to know?
All right.
Winston Wales, philantropist.
Giselle Mack runs the city art's foundation.
Seth Bath.
Why don't you just let me push back?
I'll make some calls, see how strong that case is.
How can you be so damn flip about this?
No, you're my partner.
All right, you have to give me a second, this hasn't exactly been my easiest day.
Yeah, well, you and me both.
F-O-R-A-S-Z.
Alexander Forasz.
What's the hit?
He filed a restraining order against some guy named Jared Pryor.
Is this helping?
I did some asking around, it turns out that's Garza's wife.
Thank you.
Brett Hopper couldn't have killed your husband.
He was with me all night.
Who are you?
I'm his girlfriend.
- I'm so sorry.
- I heard his name first.
Your boyfriend.
Clear as I am saying it to you.
Alberto was liying there.
I saw his face.
Detective Hopper?
Can you be a little more specific or is that on my dollar bills?
Well, to begin, they've got the murder weapon with your prints, your shirt, with Garza's blood on it, not to mention the eyewitness, Garza's wife.
The prosecution puts the grieving widow on the stand, you might as well start planning the menu for your last meal.
If you're saying to me an entire system is against you, that this is one big conspiracy, let me warn you, juries don't take kindly to the C word.
That's not what this is.
I'm being framed.
Yeah, maybe... but as your attorney, I have to advise you.
The evidence against you is... extremely compelling.
If you want my best advise, take a plea.
I can probably get you murder II.
That's fifteen to life, but no chances of the death penalty
I have to be really careful.
Sorry, man.
Where is Detweiler?
On the swing set?
You've been playing in the wrong park!
I know he's answered to somebody at the club, is that you?
Forget about the Santayana Club.
You won't get any answers there.
But where am I supposed to look?
A little closer to home.
Thanks, that's helpful!
Your old man was on the right track with the girl.
My old man?
What are you talking about ?
Think of us as... friends of your father.
DAY 3 (del vo)
Somebody's tense.
Did you have a nightmare or something?
The worst ever.
Yeah, Jen, it's me, we need to talk.
It's... about Dad.
I'm wondering if you have any of his old stuff?
I'll call you back later today.
Jared!
Why are we here?
Do you know a man named Alexander Forasz?
Yeah, well, that's because I almost caught him.
But he got away!
I can't do this.
Alright.
Yes?
You know, I have a restraining order against him.
Yes, that's why I'm here.
Please, sir, it's important.
Would you like some coffee, detective...
Hopper.
I thought you might know that.
How do you know Jared Pryor?
It's complicated.
I'm sure it is.
- Did you meet to the Santayana Club?
A club?
- How do you know I belong to the club?
- What did you do to Jared?
His surgeon?
Seizures?
- From what?
It got so drastic he just couldn't function.
We had to perform surgery.
But there were side effects.
Hallucinations, black-outs, even sufferance from hyperactive episodes of déja-vu
"Déja-vu"?
That's there is just so much about the brain that... we don't understand.
Like the memory of his brother.
- What happen to his brother?
- Well, he died.
Cancer more than a year ago, but see, Jared doesn't remember.
I took the memory of his brother away from him and that's why he comes after me.
He actually believes that he is a victim of some sort of grand conspiracy and that I'm, some king of lean leader.
How would somebody know if they had this... condition?
So?
He's not who I thought he was.
He want's to talk to you though.
He'll tell you everything.
Did you find my brother?
Thank you.
For what?
I've been alone, for so long.
Anyway, I owe you an apology.
I shouldn't have treated you the way that I did.
Still, I'm sorry I bit you.
Shut it!
Jal, OK?
Trumpets, fucking keep up.
Bollocks, bollocks.
It's just...
And you'll sort out the swearing?
OK, let's try the allegro.
And one, two, three, one, two.
Suck Tony's face off in public all the time.
We're supposed to be going shopping!
I wanna hump you silly.
We're just gonna, um, nip upstairs.
I need to go shopping.
What for?
A dress for Jal's music competition.
Pretty much.
And Michelle.
Fucking hell.
In here.
Get this.
Looks nice, yeah.
It's the Young Musician Of The Year.
Zip.
It's in your arse, Jal.
For Christ's sakes, are you gonna help me here or not?
Hurry!
- It's not right.
You really know how to talk to a girl, Sid.
What?
- For fuck's sake!
- Well, don't ask if you don't want to know.
I want a cookie.
Who's stopping you, mootbag?
Yo, you're all up in our beat, Sister.
Don't be calling our sister no waste gash, nigga.
Yeah, man, but everyone's hittin' me an' ting.
Drop a beat, Don.
Check it out, Sis.
Nice dress.
Oh, fuck it, I dunno.
I can't practise because my fucking brothers are banging out dumb hip-hop.
Boys need practice too.
Yeah, them boys need plenty of practice, you know what I'm saying?
We didn't sound so cool way back when.
Um, yeah, Jal, this is Alicia.
She's got some serious attitude.
Jesus!
- Raas, breader, dat's bate.
They're just messing with you, sweetness.
Oh, right, well, that's kicking, then.
You got places to go?
What happened to her?
We're just delighted that we've produced such a talented pupil.
Sorry, handicaps?
It's all terribly important.
In what?
The competition.
We don't like disappointment, do we, Doug?
So I've prepared a checklist of things to think when you lose.
You don't exactly put out, do you, girl?
I mean, fucking hell.
ID?
Look I just don't want to disappoint my colleague, Dr Makabi.
He's visiting from Senegal.
Katinga.
It's all right, Danny.
They can come in with me.
Sorry Jal.
You're gay, for Christ sakes.
I'm respecting.
Believe me, I'm respecting.
And I look...
I dunno, Michelle.
Oh, Christ.
Oh, fuck.
The mike ain't working!
Is there anybody in this club that doesn't know I've got a thing for Michelle?
No.
How comforting are you feeling?
Bar's closed.
Yeah, but my mate's just opened a club up the road.
Cool name.
Oh, God.
It's the principle, isn't it?
In fact, you actively don't pay me!
So now, now we're down to consequences.
Smart arse, give me your PIN number, now.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, yeah look at that.
Now that is a mighty fine body.
It's a nice tone.
- Please, I need that.
Hey, that's the kind of guy that I am.
You fucking bastards!
We go and get them good, sis!
Oh, God, they smashed my clarinet.
- Donald's not your brother, right?
Ah,it'snothing,sis .
Nothing at all.
Is there anything I can do?
I'd like a lips from Michelle.
Me, too.
Why you listening to me, girl?
Don't you talk to me through glass!
Don't be coming in my places, girl.
Blessed are those who can give without remembering, and take without forgetting.
Thanks, Effy, but you know this is the best birthday present I could have.
Ha, you know, this reminds me of when I was a boy and my Auntie Mabel, when she was carving the chicken, she always used to wear these loose-fitting tops...
Yes, I think we've all heard this one, haven't we?
It's a joke, Anthea, an anecdote.
"I'd like breast, please, and then maybe a bit of leg and stuffing."
I mean, he'd basically growl at her.
You see, that's a difficult dad.
I scoured my brain and came up with, "Thigh, please, Mabel."
That's not true.
Oh, yes, well, er, right, well, jolly good.
They've translated them from Korean.
Fucking, fucking fine.
Yes, we can just sit, yeah, and I'll see if I can find some nice... biscuits, OK?
Oh, I hate it when your mother's like this.
Night, sweetheart.
I'm asleep or just too bored to speak to you, so leave a message.'
Is this now officially silent treatment you're giving me?
Michelle broke up with me, remember?
Still, if you think this is gonna piss me off, then you're wrong.
I actually quite like it.
Panorama.
I don't think that I've given you my birthday present yet.
I know exactly what she was.
I'll fetch the turkey baster and you... wash your bits.
Though Davey, when I wore my mum's fishnets to the school disco thing, said that was well rough cos women used to wear fishnets without knickers at orgies or whatever, so, like, my mum would have got stuff on it.
And he says by wearing the tights, her stuff would have rubbed off on me.
Though I wore knickers, and I don't think my mum went to many orgies.
I mean, she grew up in Luton.
I don't think many orgies happen in Luton.
Tasting sick in your mouth, like you've got hiccups but you haven't.
Did I tell you about Davey trying to finger me?
It's my last day and they're fucking wankers to work for.
So you know, break, take, steal...
Hi, I'm Julie and this is Effy.
I've heard a lot about you, Effy.
Not all of it good.
You heard anything about me?
Wanna ride?
Shall I get on too?
We're here together!
Sorry, beer's not really my drink.
Do you want a hand... selling?
Where's all your mates, then, Tone?
Fallen on hard times, have you?
Something like that.
Well, no offence, but the sooner I get these sold, the sooner I can get home to the missus for cocoa and cuddles.
See you later.
Just missed her.
Her brother's picked her up already.
OK, her boyfriend pretending to be her brother's picked her up already.
She just left with a fat lad.
A place in the Guinness Book Of Records is hardly celebrity.
Will you stop eating the tools?
It's not my fault you decided to go for sugar cube pyramids.
Oh, hi.
Hi, Michelle.
Hello, Tony.
Look, don't worry, I'm not gonna stay.
I just needed Sid for a minute.
- I'm busy.
- Yeah, I can see that, Sid.
Fucking hell, guys, you know how to have a good time, don't you?
Please don't be a bastard.
Look, don't get so upset about it, OK?
I'm sorry I spoilt your beautiful evening.
Don't feel you have to, Sid.
You OK?
I tried ringing, but you haven't answered your phone all week.
- Did you get beaten up?
Is this another one of your games?
Yeah, Sid, it's a game.
- She was there.
She's still in the loony bin.
Why can't we nick your dad's instead?
Because, Sid, my dad has central locking, a sophisticated alarm system and probably thinks a spell in prison would do me good.
Whereas your dad has a 20-year-old car, Neighbourhood Watch and won't prosecute.
I bet you ten quid I know who you're thinking about.
No, I don't.
You must have worked out by now that I didn't do it.
You had porno pictures of your sister on your phone.
Fucked-up is an understatement.
It's like Wonkaland.
This is where the rich kids come to die.
Welcome to my world.
I feel a bit rough!
Kevin, I think you should take Julie to the bathroom.
Finally, we're alone.
I'm Jesus Christ.
Bollocks!
You know, she may be having a bit of fun, a joke at your expense.
That's not her style.
No, I know Effy.
She's cleverer than this.
Look, I'm worried about her.
- 'Effy says hi.'
Looks a bit... spooky.
You're not still afraid of the dark?
No, I don't think she's here.
Only if you want some.
Course she fucking wants it.
I hear words go past me backwards.
All the help I've ever given you, and you've been fucking useless tonight.
What did you do?
That's sick.
Are you bunching your fists at me, Sid?
If you wanna hit me, go right ahead.
I said a punch, not a bitch slap!
Sid, you'd better not be crying.
I'm not crying cos you punched me.
You're crying for the kids in Africa?
You know I used to so look up to you, don't you?
And now I can think of nothing worse than being you!
You've always been selfish, I always understood that.
You fuck with people and I don't get why.
You've got no friends, no girlfriend, only your parents left.
Not even Effy is answering your calls.
You're right, she is clever.
Every time you talk, Sid, little flecks of spit are coming out of your mouth and they're going on my face.
You're one of them, aren't you?
'Hi, this is Cass.
'Don't bother leaving a message because I'm not listening.'
I know you're there, Cassie.
I mean, I think I know you're there.
I mean, I want you to be there.
I'm at Rocatillo's.
I want to speak to you, and I think you want to speak to me.
I didn't have to answer, Tony.
I'm grateful that you did.
It's because I'm the only person you can really talk to.
What's the matter?
'Now I'm at some posh wanker night at the Ston Eaton sports club 'and I don't know what to do.'
This is the weirdest fucking night of my life.
'I gotta go.'
You know it's, like, two in the morning, don't you?
You're the one that's been following me round all night.
You've got a black eye growing, did you know that?
Do you want to kiss me, Sid?
Cool.
I'm sorry, I'm usually better than that.
No, my rhythm was out and my teeth, they kept getting in the way.
Could I... try again?
Only if you don't ask.
Who is it?
I just spoke to him.
He sounded strange, in a real mess.
Michelle, can I ring you back?
Tony.
Do you?
What the fuck are you doing?
OK, let's make a deal.
You're joking!
Well, factually it's true.
Get out of my fucking way!
You put porno pictures of my sister on my phone and I make you fuck your sister!
Is this about Michelle?
You really think Michelle is worth this?
Effy.
Then you're a shit brother.
Let's just get her to a hospital, OK?
Do you think she can hear us?
I don't know, darling.
That's enough from you.
Doctor...
It's all gone, and whatever hasn't will be out in a few days.
So I suppose we should congratulate you for getting her clean drugs.
I wasn't, I was...
What?
And who the fuck are you?
I'm his best friend!
And I'm his fucking father!
I know what you are.
Thank you, Sid.
No, I mean really, thank you.
Yeah, I know what you mean, Tony.
I'm sorry.
- We don't have to do this now.
Effy's different.
I sort of own her cos she's my sister, but with you...
I just really wanted you there.
And then you were in the car.
The thing is, Tony, you sort of own me, too.
Mostly in a good way.
Come on, I'm taking you for breakfast.
You do know it's 4am, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
I didn't expect you till tomorrow morning.
Oh. Well, most people would be thrilled.
Look, we're happy to come back tomorrow.
Call said your power was out.
Oh, well, I got a generator for the essentials.
You live here all by yourself.
So you have any idea what the problem could be?
[Accent becomes British] Actually, Mr. Graiman, I do.
We cut your power.
Come here.
What do you want?
Wonderful.
Oh, I'll also need you to guide me through the, uh, encryptions and safeties you've undoubtedly placed on your files.
I think homeboy's having a cardiac emergency.
Breathe, Charles.
Unbelievable.
We'll take the drives then grab the cardinal.
She can break his codes.
You killed the vacuum cleaner.
Make sure there's no one left in this house.
Why don't you shoot it?
Boss, better get in here and check this out.
Lower level southeast corner. [Static]
I've never seen algorithms this complex.
Dude, just go get him!
That's my kind of ride.
Certainly didn't come from the dealership.
Shut down the engine and get out of the car.
Want to go after it?
Go after what?
Whoever was driving that car knows we were here.
Might have seen our faces.
If we're lucky, we have 24 hours before the police and FBI are all over us.
Our job is to deliver Prometheus and now the girl.
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
This footage was shot in our labs last year.
As you can see, the molecular-sized nanobytes can break themselves down and reform into another shape of similar mass.
And though this is a relatively simple example, there's no limit to the size and intricacy of the possibilities.
I was just wondering if you're gonna be working with your father on all this.
No, we haven't worked together in some time.
Dustin Cary.
Well, Dustin, if you can find him, you can ask him.
Otherwise, this is my class, so try to stay on topic, okay?
You put hand soap in the dishwasher again?
Your investors are here.
And their knocking doesn't sound like the hey, let's all grab a latte kind of knocking, Mike.
Hi, Dylan.
Mike, what do you want to do?
how long has this been ringing?
Forever.
Rivai.
How long ago?
I'm on my way.
I wasn't expecting breakfast, but I didn't think you'd run out.
Just lock up when you leave, okay?
Aren't you worried about leaving someone you just met alone in your house?
Not really.
See ya.
I've been trying to contact you for the past several hours.
Look, if my father sent you, he would've given you a code word.
Where are you?
I-I just entered the library.
If someone attempts to follow you in without proper identification, you will see it.
Good idea.
Yes, I know.
That man didn't have an I.D.
Okay, what the hell is going on?
Who are you and how do you know all this?
Mike, what are you doin', man?
This is not a good idea.
They are not takin' the car, Dylan.
Get the garage door.
You know we can see you.
Get in the car!
All right, I'm in the car.
Need a lift?
(male voice) Where are you?
Outside the library.
Campus policeman's here.
Sarah, wait.
Excuse me.
Oh, thank god.
Uh, someone's following me.
Sarah, are you there?
Ask him a question campus security would know.
Miss, can you hear me?
Uh, in the meantime, you better come with me.
[British accent emerges] But there's no such thing as the gunther building or the Wilson towers,
Clever girl.
Just like your father.
How do you know my father?
'Cause I watched him die.
No, you're lying.
There are only two people in this world who could decode your father's work.
Help us, and I'll let you live.
Refuse... and I'll reunite you with your father directly.
I will never help you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Sarah, get in.
Stop shooting.
Cardinal's headed your way.
She's in the car from last night.
(Kitt) Hello, Sarah.
I apologize for being so brusque on the phone and for my tardiness.
What is this about?
I am currently working to form a reasonable hypothesis to answer that question.
But my father did send you.
I cannot be certain of his condition or location at this time.
The mansion's perimeter was breached by men with hostile intent.
My program for that scenario was very specific.
Who are these guys?
(Kitt) They are the same men who assaulted the Graiman home last night.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Your heart rate and breathing are higher than normal for a woman of your age, Sarah.
Gee, you think?
Did my dad give you a name?
I am the knight industries three thousand.
You may call me Kitt.
All right, Kitt, so where are you taking me?
I am going to the mountain roads, as they will provide the best environment in which to elude the car following us.
The what?
No, I don't.
We've got a problem here, Mike.
Doesn't he ever talk?
You have a busted car, which means no racing and no income.
And you owe me $90... $87... $90,000.
What am I, stupid?
That's why I have him.
Mike.
You have until midnight to get me my money.
Tonight?
How am I supposed to come up with that?
And if I can't?
Then Dylan disappears into the Nevada Desert.
There's an urban legend about a car Graiman built 25 years ago for Walton knight.
Supposedly possessed the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created.
I don't see how a thinking car is gonna help us.
It's the next step in Prometheus.
Are you going to slow down?
Negative.
Oh, god.
Whoa, what are you doing?
Eluding our tail.
What, are you crazy?
I do not believe so.
Not extensively, no.
Yeah, this isn't fun at all.
Sarah, your fear is irrational and misplaced.
Welcome to the world of being human.
Man, quit being such a bitch.
How much more of this do I have to take?
(Kitt) I could wait and time the next pass, but it may kill the men following us.
One of my primary directives is the preservation of human life.
But your primary directive is the preservation of our lives, right?
That is the ideal outcome.
Then make the pass!
God, I hate you.
The satellite imagery suggests they are unable to continue the pursuit.
But there will be more of them.
How soon can you get us off this road?
We must continue on this route for 23.8 miles.
(Sarah) Kitt, a stop sign!
There is another option, however.
That's incredible.
And should provide adequate cover until we reach our destination.
You mean until we reach home.
Kitt, my father is missing.
We're going home to find out what happened to him.
And how will you accomplish that?
I don't know yet.
If those men continue to attack us, how will you defend yourself?
I have you.
(Kitt) Advanced as I am, there are situations in which human help will be required.
I am not your father.
My mission after ensuring your safety is to enlist the help of Mike Traceur.
My father programmed you to find Mike Traceur?
Carrie Rivai, apple of my eye.
You don't even know who that is, do you?
He was a civilian inventor working on Prometheus for the pentagon.
Oh, the remote control thing.
It's the remote system by which all our military drones are controlled and our smart bombs are guided.
Yeah, the remote control thing.
So why'd they call you?
Because I knew him.
Let me know what you find on Graiman's hard drives.
Where the hell is this thing?
I said take it down.
That car won't go anywhere without her.
There's gotta be a better way of tracking them.
Coroner's initial report cites a heart attack.
We're not getting backup until there's evidence of foul play.
So when do we leave?
I'm leaving immediately.
I need something else from you.
Graiman had a daughter, Sarah.
She teaches at Stanford.
She was basically his only connection to the outside world.
What is wrong with you?
What, like how?
My recall is 100% accurate.
Do you not know Mike Traceur?
But you do not speak anymore.
I left for Stanford and never heard from him again.
That's strange.
Why would he cut off all contact?
Because he's immature and selfish.
And why would your father send us to him?
(Sarah) Because my father trusts him.
How far out of our way do we have to go?
I am not yet sure of that.
You don't know where he lives?
There are numerous images of Mr. Traceur in Las vegas over the last ten months and as recently as two days ago at an ATM.
But that's 600 miles away.
627.
At maximum speed baring any unforeseen traffic anomalies, we can be there in 3 hours and 17 minutes.
You're kidding.
I do not kid.
You are sad.
Yes.
Do you know what that is?
I have a definition of the term.
But you'll never feel it.
And despite that knowledge, grief is inevitable?
I'm not sure that I understand.
My mother left my father a few years ago.
He's a great father, but not much of a husband.
You blamed your father for your parents' failed marriage.
I told him that he'd driven her away.
It was the worst thing I ever said to him.
And I never had a chance to take it back.
You are talking about regret.
I have no recent data from Mrs. Graiman.
To have so many years as a family and it might all end like this just... sucks.
That does "suck."
Why did you bring this up?
It is widely documented that verbally expressing the root of an emotion can help provide peace of mind.
Is that research mistaken?
(Kitt) Mike Traceur has just made a cash advance withdrawal on his credit card.
Yeah, that's him.
Take the earpiece.
It's a communicator so we can keep in contact.
It is always activated so I can always respond.
Okay.
Sheriff Ramsey.
Afternoon.
So you won't mind if I have a look around.
Graiman lived alone as far as we could tell.
His wife passed away a while back.
Couldn't find a number for his daughter or anyone who knew him really.
You need a positive I.D. For the body.
Well, I figure seeing as how you knew him.
Bet... 2,000.
All-in.
Did you have it?
You plan on playing like that all day?
What are you doin' here?
It's nice to see you too.
No, I just meant how did you... look, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I need you to leave here and come with me right now.
You gotta be kidding me.
I'll explain everything on the way.
What could you possibly say to explain that?
And this morning, men tried to abduct me.
That's actually a pretty good start.
What did the cops say?
Dad wanted me to come to you for some reason.
Looks like they know each other.
Let's try to I.D. The guy.
What's that mean?
It means I can't help you.
(Kitt) Sarah, the men who were following us earlier are now in the casino.
By the bar, black coat.
Sarah, what is it?
By the bar, black coat.
By the slots, red sweater.
Were you wearing that top this morning?
I run, I leave someone out to dry.
And a poker game is your master plan?
You got a better idea?
Help me, and I'll clear you.
Hey, you there?
Yes, I'm here.
How can you see them?
I have accessed the casino's security cameras.
They're heading to the east entrance.
They've seen us.
They're looking for a way out.
They have all the exits covered.
If you're considering hand-to-hand combat, may I make another suggestion?
Go to the security door on the east wall.
Those doors have remote locks, genius.
I'm aware of that.
You're lucky that worked.
Luck does not factor into it.
I'm not sure my entering the casino would be the most subtle approach.
Where did you find this guy?
I'm lookin' forward to it.
What happened?
Our job just got harder.
Nice ride.
What the hell is goin' on?
Just get in.
I thought you said your contact was in the car.
No, I said my contact was the car.
Do you mind telling me how this thing is driving by itself?
Kitt?
T even think about it, Mike.
Mike, don't antagonize the car.
Yes, I know.
Do these guys know what this looks like?
I wouldn't worry about that.
Who knew it came in "cholo"?
We're gonna need all of them.
Charles Graiman is still alive.
It's the power company.
At this hour?
All the security systems are down.
Thank you, Ben.
(Ramsey) So he's been using a body double.
After awhile, people didn't know the difference.
Seems like a crazy thing to do, you ask me.
The dead body at the morgue makes me think the opposite.
My backup's still hours away.
Could sure use your help on this.
I'll call in whatever help I can.
Part of the footage I captured when I was leaving your home included this:
I have traced the vehicle's registration to the black river corporation.
What's black river?
A private security firm.
I spent time with some of their men on the ground in Iraq.
My analysis of the situation leads me to believe that black river is most likely after Charles' research in order to try to get control of Prometheus.
Within seconds of breaking Charles' encryption, they would be capable of crashing planes, attacking foreign nations.
The result of which would be chaos, certain death, and possible war.
And he just had the program specs laying around on his hard drives?
They would need Charles Graiman to decode e da.
Or someone who knows what Charles knows.
I possess all of Charles Graiman's knowledge and can access Prometheus.
That seemed quite irrational.
Well, you clearly don't know much about women.
(Kitt) On the contrary, my database...
Kitt, shut up.
Sarah, where are you goin'?
To get a rental car.
Look, maybe the FBI can help us.
The FBI will stick us in a room and ask questions for 12 hours.
I've already wasted too much time coming out here.
You would do the same thing for someone you loved.
I cannot allow you to go on by yourself.
Either you take me back home or I'm going by myself.
In that case, I have no choice but to take you.
You do realize by going back to the house, you'll be doing exactly what they expect you to.
You can leave if you want.
I will still pay your debt.
Your choice.
How is that possible?
The FBI agent that's here confirmed it.
That body isn't Charles Graiman.
Thank you for your assistance.
Let me know if anything else turns up.
Well, it seems our dead Mr. Graiman is not Mr. Graiman after all.
So what do you want to do?
We continue back to the mansion as planned.
Hey, I really am sorry about all this.
Your dad was always good to me... to my mom.
How is your mom?
You still don't talk to her?
If your only parent sent you away, you might not want to talk to them either.
Mike... you weren't exactly a choir boy.
She might not have had a choice.
Everyone has a choice.
Tell me you're winning.
I had the office try and triangulate the signal, but it's either off or dead.
I left her messages.
Email me the number.
Agent Rivai.
Carrie.
What do you see here?
Somebody removed all the hard drives.
No kidding.
Move and I'll kill you.
Jenny, it's me.
It's Charles.
Is your car out back?
Kitt, pull over.
Is something wrong?
What is it, Mike?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I gotta pee.
I'm sorry, what?
I practically stalked you.
And, um, you never responded.
All year... we talked about how we couldn't wait to see each other.
And then... you just disappeared.
Sorry.
That's it?
You met someone?
Right.
So... are you guys still together or did she run away with G.I. Joe?
You could've told me, you know.
What are you doing?
You want to drive?
Kitt's not another trans am, is it?
It's a mustang.
I needed someone to watch over Sarah.
He was the logical choice.
Kitt, back.
Kitt, forward.
I must make a stop.
You know we did stop an hour ago.
If you had to go, you should've gone then.
I'm glad you're having fun with this.
I require fuel.
You run on gas.
Not hydrogen or plutonium or somethin' really cool I've never heard of?
Complicated isn't always better.
Why you gotta hate on Nebraska?
My system is largely solar powered and recycles 91% of its expended energy, allowing a ratio of 167 miles travelled for every gallon of fuel burned.
So the super car runs on gas.
This is weird.
What is weird?
You think I am a creepy guy.
Forget it.
Why did you leave Sarah Graiman?
Oh, we are not talking about this.
Sarah said you are immature and selfish, and that is why you left her.
She said that?
Do you have another girlfriend?
Are you a homosexual?
Is it not natural that you should have a companion of some sort?
Monogamy is not natural.
Why do you say that?
Because relationships don't last.
I cannot be happy.
Yeah, me neither.
Client's team was able to pull the specs for the car's computer off of Graiman's hard drives.
What does that mean?
It means that now it's just another computer.
We need to find it first.
No, we don't.
You would not be pleased if I dropped food on you.
Do unto others.
From the book of Matthew 7:12.
This is intolerable.
All right, I'll pick up the chip.
I have received new coordinates as well as a phone call I will patch through.
Sarah.
Dad.
I went to Jennifer's.
Is she with you?
Where you now?
We're at the park woods motel.
Kitt is bringing you here.
Are those men still after you?
Listen, has the FBI tried to reach you?
Well, use Kitt to try and contact Carrie Rivai.
Love you too.
Baby, it's me.
I hope you're okay.
I took lucky out to p... who is that?
That's Brock.
He's kind of my boyfriend.
You have a boyfriend?
Named Brock?
So does he own a long board or use "dude" as a verb?
Sarah Graiman, this is special agent Carrie Rivai.
It's extremely important you call me.
park woods motel mile route 33.
E... - checkin' in?
Looking for a friend.
Charles Graiman.
Uh, yeah, he's here.
That's kinda tough to say.
Any easier now?
It's... it's close.
You're welcome.
(Kitt) A thermo imaging scan of the motel is picking up three heat sources moving amongst the buildings.
What does that mean?
That they're already here.
(Kitt) Proceed to the office with caution.
I can guide you to Charles Graiman's room.
Would you prefer to avoid confrontation?
What the hell!
I still can't believe you built another one.
The three heat sources are now approaching the ro we?
A?
Here there was another Kitt?
Well, what happened with it?
(Kitt) Pause to avoid visual contact.
How do you fit in?
We were moved here too, Mike, when you were a baby at your father's request.
My...?
My father left us.
What does that even mean?
Your father's name is Michael knight.
He was the man who drove the first Kitt.
I get over it.
Please stop yelling before you get us all killed.
Agent Rivai, good of you to come.
Hello, Charles.
This way.
Did Ben make it ou no.
They took your hard drives.
How long before they break your encryption?
It's difficult to say.
Without the codes, it could be hours.
We need to get you someplace safe.
Dad, I'm so sorry for everything.
Me too, honey.
Well, what do we do?
(Kitt) 14 seconds.
Kitt, shut down the computer now.
Shutting down all systems.
It can still be driven, but it has to be done manually.
Weapons down.
I won't ask a second time.
No, no, no!
(welther) Guns!
Now.
Or the girl dies next.
You're gonna be fine, okay?
I'm so sorry.
Mom, it's gonna be okay, all right?
I'm guessing that even if you won't give us Prometheus, the car will.
You have no idea what you're doing.
You could start a war.
Besides, a little war's always good for business, isn't it?
Cooperate, and I assure you that everyone will get out of this alive.
Transport's on the way.
Charles, you mind coming with us?
And Sarah can stay here with the car.
You two on your knees now, please.
Down.
Kill them.
Then take the car and the girl and meet us at the rendezvous.
Move.
You know, you really need to shut up.
[Cocks Gun] Mike, no.
Sarah, get the hell out of here.
Thank you for doing this.
I'm not doing it for you.
Is the car's computer still shut down?
Yeah, it's gotta be the kid driving.
Charles, we're gonna need those codes right now.
Sheriff Ramsey, if you'd be so kind.
Mike, take it easy.
Don't you think I know that?
I thought this thing was bullet proof!
Without the computer, the nanotechnology can't fix itself.
And if we turn the computer on?
We might only have ten seconds before they can get control of it.
The codes now.
Mike, pull around on the other side.
Sheriff, this side.
There's a backdoor into Prometheus.
It's a simple password.
That should do it.
Sending it now.
Wait.
What are you doing?
When I tell you to, turn on Kitt's computer.
What's he doing?
Okay, the computer's back on and it's blocking our outgoing transmission.
Mike, what exactly are you going to do?
(Kitt) Mike, Sarah, are you all right?
This doesn't change anything.
Start tracing all calls immediately.
Dad, you're bleeding.
That's all right.
Oh, careful.
You sure let a girl sneak up on you.
How old were you?
What could have made me smile like that?
You don't have to leave, you know.
People here who care about you.
I can't stay here.
And what about you?
Actually, I'm gonna stay here for awhile.
We should go.
The car's waiting.
This one doesn't talk too, does it?
I know what today is, but there are things to discuss.
Like what?
By tracing calls made from the black river cell phone, last night, FBI agents recovered Charles' hard drives just outside Dubai.
The encryption had not been broken.
Congratulations.
(Rivai) The FBI knew that Charles was building another Kitt.
We've known for some time.
I'm resurrecting the foundation, Michael.
Will be working in cooperation with the FBI.
Why are you tellin' me?
We want you to drive it.
(Charles) Look, I know the timing isn't great, but we need someone immediately.
You have to make a choice, Michael.
Either participate or withdraw.
As am I.
I'm sorry about your loss.
Thanks.
I'm Michael.
Michael knight.
I'm your father.
Mike.
I know.
I was horrible to her.
I blamed her for everything.
She did a good job raising you.
Couldn't have been easy.
So now what?
You move forward.
? Yeah.
About 25 years ago, there was a man named Walton knight who on his deathbed told me, "one man can make a difference."
I was that man.
Take care of yourself.
Hey, Michael.
Am I gonna see you again?
I hope so.
Suddenly it all became so clear.
We may have grown up a few miles from each other, but we were both from different worlds.
And right then I knew we were bound to end up in different ones.
See, you say that and yet... here we are.
(Rivai) Two days ago, an American diplomat was found dead just outside Prague.
The FBI is sending a team to investigate.
12 hours ago, they failed to check in and have failed to since then.
So be careful when you find her.
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Now this is a serious machine.
Think you could do us all a favor and avoid crashing it?
Please, 'cause this time around, the FBI's picking up the tab.
I'll do my best.
That hardly sounds reassuring.
I've recalibrated all the settings, so his system will be impossible to track.
I helped.
Sort of.
Take care of yourself, okay?
Well, together again.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Mind if I drive?
Is this going to become a habit?
Definitely.
More details about the new Star Trek film.
{pos(192,220)}There's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth.
- Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's Dad in a little room with a copy of Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears.
How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same?
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, "Hey, get your thing out of my nose."
Diet Coke.
And yogurt.
And a little nail polish.
I'll take a look at it.
So, in your world, you're like the cool guys.
Recognize.
Zod?
Good story.
You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition?
Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary?
Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle?
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
By that reasoning we should also play Bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.
Tickets to that, please.
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you?
No, don't.
{pos(192,220)}How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?
{pos(192,220)}It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads-up for the ladies.
The ladies?
Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.
All those in favor... {pos(192,210)}Point of order.
{pos(192,210)}Will the gentleman from the great State of Denial yield for a question?
I will yield.
Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Physics Bowl practice round.
Gentlemen, ready?
{pos(192,210)}He'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd.
He only has a problem when they're one-on-one and smell nice.
Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics.
"What is the shortest light pulse ever produced?"
- Dr. Cooper.
- And of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.
And of course the answer is giant magnetoresistance.
Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions?
I am an engineer.
By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.
Just ask another one.
"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einstein's predicted frame dragging?"
And of course, it's Gravity Probe B.
Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.
Why?
Because it's polite.
What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.
Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.
The objective of the competion is to give correct answers.
If I know them, why shouldn't I give them?
Some of us might have the correct answers, too.
What did he say?
He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.
Yeah, and the bag it came in.
Can it wait?
I need to talk to you.
Army Ants.
Isn't that confusing? "AA" might mean something else to certain people.
Why would a Physics Bowl team be called Anodized Aluminum?
No, I meant...
Never mind.
Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman and cookies, and you're off the team.
What?
Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.
Why?
Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics Bowl the team that has the most fun?
You're welcome.
{pos(192,220)}He just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.
{pos(192,220)}He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.
How exactly would that laugh go?
That sounds more like, "We are a tall, thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians."
Let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my roommate.
So?
Gentlemen.
We're going to need a strong fourth for our team.
You know who is apparently very smart is the girl who played TV's Blossom.
She got a PhD. in neuroscience or something.
Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our Physics Bowl team.
How about the girl from The Wonder Years?
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems.
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.
Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.
Sack up, dude.
Fine.
Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.
There's not?
Gee, 'cause it sure sounds like there should be.
Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.
Proceed.
We are entering the Physics Bowl, and we need a fourth for our team.
Sorry.
Well, we tried.
We'll just have to face Sheldonmano y mano y mano a mano.
Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?
That arrogant, misogynistic, East Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high-energy particles for laundry and childbearing?
She's in.
Got your game face on?
Are you ready?
Gentlemen.
I'm just gonna sit down.
So, is that your team?
So, may I introduce the third-floor janitor, the lady from the lunch room, and my Spanish is not good... either her son or her butcher.
And what about your team?
What rat have you recruited to the S.S. Sinking Ship?
Hello, Sheldon.
Leslie Winkle.
Here's your T-shirt.
PMS?
It's a couple days early...
It stands for "Perpetual Motion Squad."
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl!
Today's preliminary match features two great teams.
All night long, y'all!
PMS?
AA?
And of course, the answer is technetium.
Terrific.
PMS?
Correct.
How does a quantum computer factor large numbers?
PMS?
4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
Prevost's theory of exchanges.
Lambda equals one over pi r squared n.
760 degrees Celsius... the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.
Mr. Wolowitz, this is your second warning.
A sigma particle.
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the Earth.
Correct!
Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question.
So, for 100 points and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens.
Solve the equation.
Holy crap.
What the hell is that?
Looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.
You are never gonna let that go, are you?
Ten seconds.
PMS?
Sorry, I panicked.
Then guess.
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.
AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours.
He doesn't have it.
He's got squat.
AA, I need your answer.
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.
- What are you doing?
How do you know anything about physics?
Leningrad Politechnika.
Go Polar Bears.
Look, now, maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this Physics Bowl team, I rule with an iron fist.
AA, I need your official answer.
Denied.
That's too bad because the answer your teammate gave was correct.
That's your opinion.
Is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team?
I don't understand the question.
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.
Who?
My Physics Bowl trophy.
- I know someone who would disagree.
Leonard is so smart.
- Sheldon who?
- All right, that is very immature.
I am settling once and for all who is the smartest around here, okay?
The Brady Bunch.
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?"
The Brady Bunch?
Van Halen.
"Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum."
How do you know these things?
I go outside, and I talk to people.
I don't think it's Shatner.
Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.
Formal protest.
"Singer who sang, Oops, I Did It Again?"
"Tweetie Bird tought he taw a what?"
Romulan.
Dad, I'm freezing.
We wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill !
I thought global warming would take care of it.
Al Gore can't do anything right.
I got some old magazines to burn.
Big Tall Halloween Costume catalogue.
Mom, I didn't know you went to college !
Hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets.
Like which kid's their favorite !
It's Lisa.
Yeah, what happened while I was chillin' in Dad's junk ?
There is a part of our past that we haven't told you kids about.
The Iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling Matt Groening created Futurama, and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a TV show called Melrose Place.
Your mother and I were dating, and we had just moved into our first apartment together.
You know, these IKEA foam futons do Velcro together.
Sonic The hedghog says "Wait until marriage".
Okay, everyone, let's warm up our harmonies.
An expensive dream.
Well, Well, Well, look who's come crawling back to work for your old man.
None of your business.
This counts as your break.
But Marge's education was worth all the pistol-whipping in the world.
This place is just like the brochure:
Fraternity pledges in their beanies.
I think I'm gonna like it here.
So, have you all bought the required textbooks for this class ?
Everything you think you know about history is a lie.
Are you saying that America was founded on misconceptions ?
Who said that ?
That is exactly what I'm saying.
Fall semester, you just got interesting.
The bridges of Madison county.
This book sucks so much.
Homie, my mind has been opened in so many ways !
Did you know that every US president has been a straight white man ?
Even Walt Disney ?
And did you also know that history is written by the winners ?
If you think that, you should meet my new professor.
Professor August has shown me a side of the world I never knew.
Professor August, eh ?
Who is he, somegray-haired old bookworm ?
Uh, 3:00 to 5:00, right ?
If my beads are parted, come right in.
I will !
"Just shut up, monkey man, and make the gas flow. "
Anyway, I was growing to admire my professor more and more.
Professor, do you think white male scientists have marginalized the contributions of the Third World ?
Oh, Elaine, will you ever find someone who's sponge-worthy ?
Professor August says the situation comedy is a doomed genre.
Hey, I worked hard all day to pay for your education.
Can't I get all Zima'd up and have my best girl put salve on my laser burns ?
Are the lasers supposed to burn you ?
Apparently if all the kids fire at your stomach at once, it adds up.
Marge, your art project for "protest studies" is very impressive.
Thank you, Professor August.
Homer's perfect for me !
You are his object.
Well, I know you'd never say anything that isn't objective...
Marge, your assignment is to think about what I've said about your relationship.
Are you by that Joan Miro Statue ?
It's "Juan" Miro !
Stupid townie !
Hey, it's townies like me that cook your food and clean your bathrooms !
Marge, this dreamcatcher was given to me by a warrior of the Lakopane tribe, a tribe ruled by women.
I think it has already caught my dream.
I smashed a beatnik's guitar and he sued me for damages !
Successfully !
I'm taking our music to the next level :
Guitar Rock Utilizing Nihilist Grunge Energies.
Hey, Marge.
Homer, your music is so angry and bitter.
Well, if you feel that way maybe you can find someone who wants to nurture the new you, maybe someone a little older and more sophisticated, who can take you to Europe during the summer.
Marge come back.
Mom, why did you stop talking for two and a half minutes ?
It seemed like 20.
I just want a tentacle.
Gimme a beer, Moe.
I don't sell booze no more.
This is a cigar bar now.
Leave the humidor.
I don't feel so good.
Okay, let's go back to my place.
Ready to take my personal tour of Springfield's most wheelchair-unfriendly restaurants ?
Seeing Marge always reminds me of Marge.
Now where will I get my oxygen ?
Have you really read all of these books ?
Morally, I couldn't display them on shelves if I hadn't.
But I watch sports as well, just like a regular man.
Why don't we put on some music ?
Marge, may I compliment your appearance ?
If I were to approach you for a kiss, would you construe that as harassment or give your willing consent ?
Just do it already !
Why aren't I happy ?
I'm the hottest grunge artist on Mucous Records.
Weird Al is doing a parody of my song.
He who is tired of Weird Al is tired of life.
I thought they were just tall so boats could see them.
Look, a wedding !
Slavery is alive and well in Springfield.
You oppose marriage ?
Marge, marriage has oppressed women for centuries.
Oh, Marge, it's statements like that make people say women are stupid.
It's statements like that that... are mean !
Well, it may sound mean, but I'm just trying to help you evolve.
I only got denied tenure because my department head is an idiot !
Der, duh, what did you say about me ?
Could he be singing about me ?
He is !
We interrupt this "Bleak Block" to bring you a breaking story.
Grunge trailblazer Sadgasm have broken up.
Reclusive front man Homer Simpson has holed himself up in his mansion, as rumors swirled about an out-of-control narcotics addiction.
This is Kurt Loder reporting from... the '90s.
No, narcotics !
Oh, my God, you're a junkie !
I need it...
I had become diabetic from drinking too many Frappuccinos.
Homie, I got so caught up in the world of college that I forgot how important your love was.
Can you find it in your heart to take me back ?
At least we know there'll never be a president worse than Bill Clinton.
Imagine, lying in a deposition in a civil lawsuit.
That's the worst sin a president could commit.
Yep, that professor couldn't keep me and Marge apart.
I mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach.
Well, that professor did teach me one good lesson:
Homie is where my heart is.
Townies.
Good, 'cause I'm parking at it right now.
A carnival?
What's so romantic about this?
It'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall.
That was the best Christmas ever.
Ah, the Tunnel of Love.
Nothing gets a woman in your arms faster than scary robots and simulated privacy.
Bart, no, it's Valentine's Day.
Due to a classic Jell-O prank, this ride has been disabled.
Please remain in your boats.
You will be charged for the extra time.
This is a terrible Valentine's Day.
Even better, a tale of...
One moment.
A tale of two young outlaws in love.
Miss Bonnie, might I escort you to the picture show?
I swear I won't misbehave.
Then no, thank you.
This is Texas, future home of Akeem Olajuwon!
And I've got dreams as big as he will be.
I want action!
Action, eh?
Clyde Barrow , local bad boy.
Bonnie Parker
Say, if you're so bad, you could go stick up that feed store over yonder.
I'll see you at Thanksgiving!
Wow, I guess violence is her only turn-on.
Well, there might be others, but I'm too lazy to figure out what they are.
So violence it is!
Oh, there's somethin' this kissing' is missin'.
Oh, Clyde, you know just what a girl likes.
Why are you shooting at us?
Hey, can I give you folks a lift?
Well, deposit yourselves in a seat because you've earned my interest!
Bonnie and Clyde souvenirs are flying off the shelves, and the Dust Bowl duo has inspired their own radio show.
Uh, Bonnie, where did you put the money we stole?
Their notoriety has reached the highest levels of government
Somebody please remind me to move them back.
I would be honored to perform that duty.
Listen, Sheriff, I can help you take down Bonnie and Clyde.
After the racially insensitive cartoon.
One taco coming up.
Even I'm offended by this, and I'm a fat Southern sheriff.
Okay, but if you change your mind, you know where I'm at.
Damn, just my luck!
So that's the end of the story, huh?
We want to hear a story.
A story suitable for children.
I call it Shady and the Vamp.
She's so beautiful.
Imagine what she looks like with her collar off.
A mutt like you could never get a fancy dame like that.
Even her fleas have more class than you.
Lady Bitington, will you be summering in the hindquarters again this year?
It's where all the fleas are fleeing.
Watch and learn.
You know, heaven must have left its doggie door open because you are one...
Oh, you poor thing!
Is there anything I can do?
You can have dinner with me.
Can you bring a friend for me?
I like those chicks with them head cones when they start talking, you can drop below the horizon.
You say it's goin' kinda-a rough?
That is precisely what I'm saying.
You're pretty feisty for an upper-class bitch.
Oh, I like that you use the technical termfor a female dog.
Why didn't I listen to Mama?
"Serve-a food to humans!"
I have to admit, that was exciting.
That was the most... wonderful night of my life.
I haven't seen Shady in weeks.
Any minute now.
We gotta find our daddy.
Yeah, he's gotta teach me how to lick my...
Come on!
Ah, looks like that problem solved it self.
Now, uh, how 'bout you and me sniff each other's butts?
I'm just kiddin'.
Unless you want to.
Well, Looks like it's just you and me again tonight.
Sure you are.
You two are next.
Here's your last meal.
It's Cycle 5, specially formulated for dogs with five minutes to live.
Don't bite the hand that kills ye!
Yay, Dad!
I knew you'd come save us!
You two are going home, and I'm coming with ya!
This place is no picnic, but it sure beats working for Disney.
I want to stay, sit, roll over and beg!
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please...!
All right, we can be a family.
All four of us.
Uh... you know, there are nine other puppies.
Even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it.
The era of The Brady Bunch, Donny and Marie and...
Yeah, I'm really lucky you saved me from meeting other people and having new experiences.
What is that raw, primo sound?
Chocolate?
Nancy's too smart to put that in her body.
It's only for losers, like musicians and...
Uh, okay.
Happy to be of service, old bean.
Look, an American nerd bird.
Chocolate is boring.
Oh, you're offering me some?
Yup, it's boring all right.
How much more you got?
We're gonna go out and play our songs like we've never played them before: competently!
Where's Sid?
I told you to hire Tom Responsible.
Slag off.
Can't reach me bass.
Dang it, I wanted to hear what else was bollocks!
You gobbed up our gig, you git!
I'm doing what now?
You're quitting the band.
He's going solo, and I'm gonna write his songs!
I'm doing this 'cause I want to, not 'cause she told me to.
Bang harder!
Yes, pet.
This song doesn't make me feel angry at all.
If anything, it makes my anger ebb!
Your music violates everything punk stands for, which is nothing!
Oh, I love you, my Hershey hero.
And I love you, Tootsie Roll.
Happy Valentine's Day and shut your gob.
I did not!
The system works!
Many hurt, but nobody cool was harmed.
Who's the new meat in my seat?
Bart, this is Donny... he's here at our school because he was kicked out of P.S. 132.
Hey, Krabappel, your name sounds like "crab apple."
Did you go sour waiting for someone to pick you?
Pretty much.
Isn't he awesome?
When he grows up, I want to be like me!
Oh, well, you just keep on capisce-ing.
Loa... ner?
She's right here.
This is the kind of car you see in commercials!
How much am I paying for this?
- Nothing.
- Hm, it seems like a lot.
That's the dumb...
What a stu...
I mean, that sounds fair.
Okay, so...
Cut it out!
What's the matter, son?
There's this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me.
Really, Dad?
Son, I know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off, but since then I've really come to respect you.
And unlike love, respect can't be bought.
That's my boy.
Now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater.
Foul!
Great, I fouled out.
Nope, I grant you five more fouls.
Top this, Donny.
Students may spend up to ten points per day in up to four of seven categories.
Unused points roll over week to week but not month to month.
This almost makes me want to find out how magnets work.
Who did this?
Until I find out, no one is leaving this mixed-use auditorium.
But some of us have after-school care!
Come see me when you get out.
We're gonna put Bart Simpson away for a long, long time.
By law, the most we can give him is a ten-day suspension.
Well, that's long to a kid!
All our other attempts to get a spy inside the Bart Simpson operation have failed.
Uter, Ralph, Doug the hip guidance counselor... he was never the same after Bart got through with him.
Your extracurriculars are gonna need a lot of work if you want to get into Vanderbilt.
Young man, I'm gonna be on you like a numerator on a denominator!
I've never seen blue vines before.
Here's a little hair of the dog for tomorrow.
Oh, thanks, Bart.
Now th we're buddies, I can let you in on some of the cool scams we run at school.
Bathroom passes, doctor's notes...
Milhouse, bust out four of our finest juice boxes.
I just wanna say... juice-box fight!
How is that fun?
Fun's only fun if everyone's having fun.
Mom, what are you doing?
Honey, this is how I save money on ketchup and mustard.
Do you do it with relish?
No, I'm kind of embarrassed about it.
Mrs. Simpson, may I take you for an evening drive?
Our loaner awaits.
Did you just unlock the car from here?
Now why don't you enjoy the sounds of my wife and me making sweet, sweet love.
That wasn't us, that was the transmission.
I'm one whistle away from three whistles, people!
Faculty lounge
Skinner's five steps ahead of me.
I put a tack in his chair, he's corked his pants!
I throw a tomato, he's making salad!
I have some information ye might be interested in.
But it won't be easy to hear.
- Who is it?
Thanks, Willie.
Got him.
Where am I?
You're in line for a measle shot.
Okay, now we've made a guide hole for the real needle.
Uh, Bart, where are we going?
Gentlemen, someone I thought I could trust is a rat.
Now, let's see.
Is it my best friend, my other best friend, or a kid I just met?
Donny... grab Milhouse's legs.
You grew tired of always being in my shadow.
Don't worry, we'll get him out in a couple hours.
Hey, I'm in here.
Gentlemen, this is an ostrich egg.
The whole insides.
The radio lets me contribute directly to NPR.
This is Terry Gross from NPR, saying "Thank you. "
Now, let's get back to our 1987 interview with Senator Alan Cranston.
I never dreamed an American car designed in Germany, assembled in Mexico from parts made in Canada could be so amazing.
My old car.
So you're sure this baby'll make it out to the desert?
Well, we gonna start by shooting her full of holes, and, uh, then me and the boys are gonna have a little fun with her.
Sorry, Maggie.
Say, Simpson, would you mind holding one end of this banner while I put it up?
My pleasure, sir.
We'll see who's laughing when your house is smeared with ostrich albumen.
Donny's the rat.
I will, but it's because I want to.
Hey, Bart, uh, what are we doing here?
Blue from the vines you gave him.
Skinner and Chalmers wanted to get someone inside your organization someone with no history.
Too cute, too tall, too Siamese, too Siamese.
I'm sorry, Bart.
You were like a brother to me.
We were going to take wood shop together and make nunchucks.
And then take people to our lockers and show them our nunchucks.
Are we going to fizz this guy or what?
Now imagine that times a million.
And it's all going to go down in Skinner's office.
That's all we needed to hear.
Running away rules!
Sorry to plop, plop on your fizz, fizz.
You see, the rat who told you about my rat was also a rat.
It was rats within rats... which was also me dinner last night.
Bart, we're going to send you to the toughest juvenile detention center there is.
And it's all thanks to Donny here, who can happily live the rest of his life knowing he betrayed the one boy who actually cared about him.
Skinner!
Well, I guess we're even.
What are you going to do now?
The rat symbolizes obviousness.
You like that?
I don't know.
You want me to use my butt again?
I don't know how I got here.
How many drinks did I have?
Your scotch hasn't even arrived yet.
Means I was drunk when I got here.
8:50.
I remember being at work.
I've lost at least four hours.
Say five words.
Are you okay?
I'm trying to find that out.
You're bleeding.
Or it's someone else's blood.
Can you see a wound?
No keys, no phone, I've been mugged.
Someone is going to die.
Who?
I have no idea.
Keep the change.
I saw somebody dying.
You saw 30 people flying into glass and metal.
A week ago, you noticed a symptom in a soap star.
Bad argument, since I was right about that.
Hey, hold your head still unless you want me to sew your nose onto your eye.
What if I saw someone and I followed them on from somewhere in Princeton?
You okay?
Where's your cane and motorcycle, and where'd you go last night?
What if it's not a coincidence?
You mean like the hand of God reaching down and screwing with you?
That, or the symptom caused the crash.
You see anybody in a bus driver's uniform?
Right here, purpura on Lalph Klamden's neck.
Indicative of leukemia.
You have a fever.
No, I'm fine.
98.6.
I need him to stay.
Pulse is normal, BP's normal, everything's normal.
I just have a stiff neck from the crash.
Stiff neck.
This man has meningitis.
We need to quarantine the whole ER.
No one leaves here until their full work-up is complete.
You left here at 5:23 p. m.
Your motorcycle never made it home.
We did pull up a list of all the injuries.
Twenty-two victims were brought here, injuries ranging from a broken pelvis to a severed right foot.
The other eight were taken over to Princeton General.
Be helpful if these came with head shots and resumes.
Twenty-something-year-old Jane Doe, kidney contusion, laceration on her leg.
Both of which are expected complications when someone goes from 60 to 0 in no seconds flat.
We make a list of all the bars between here and the crash site, we find out where I went, we go there...
You're not gonna do anything, are you?
When you remember, you can page us.
I'll build the giant submarine, you get the miniaturization gizmo.
Medical hypnosis can bring the brain to a Class 2 Theta state, increasing focus and memory retrieval.
You're not gonna make me do the chicken dance, are you?
I did a rotation in Melbourne.
Focus on the sound of your breath.
Wilson is done talking now.
This is a waste of time.
Cool.
Clear your mind.
Think back to how you felt.
Details you saw.
Why'd you get so drunk at 5:00 in the afternoon, alone?
I need a reason?
I could be mistaken, but I can't actually lie under hypnosis.
What are you running away from?
When I'm drinking, without you, what am I running away from?
Do you see anyone in the bar?
Say something to make me focus.
Get your girlfriend out of here.
You put her in my head.
I can't even have a conversation with you in my subconscious without her tagging along.
I didn't say it out loud?
What's going on in there?
If I can't lie, I need these two out of here.
Let's just ignore Wilson and Amber from now on, shall we?
Does the bartender have any odd symptoms?
No, he seems fine.
Passengers.
Anything special about them?
Because nose picking could mean nasal pruritus.
You have a brain tumor.
Go home, have fun, relax.
I'm probably just a nut case.
Tilt your head back.
I'm admitting you.
So, we have the who but not the what.
Guillain-Barré fits.
Just trying to figure out what Guillain-Barré looks like.
You can't just eliminate everything because it doesn't match what you might have seen.
How about because it doesn't match what I could have seen?
Guillain-Barré has no external physical manifestations.
Sudden paralysis while driving a bus.
Are you sure you're feeling okay?
Where are you going?
Yeah, I'll start him on antibiotics in case it's transverse myelitis.
You guys go sniff a city bus.
Why are you smelling the passengers' clothes?
Smell is the most powerful evokerater of memory.
If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain helps focus the memory.
You split your head open.
Wish me luck.
I'm going in, Rambo style.
House, do you think this is gonna work, or are you just stoned?
Both, apparently.
So you're saying I'm not here?
Okay, so I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.
Better hope so. 'Cause otherwise, means your brain's bleeding.
I wasn't asking you, I was asking me, because you've already proven that you're not here.
Stop arguing with a hallucination and get some treatment.
He can't.
The hallucination is your messed-up brain's way of reasoning out a problem.
You weren't on the bus.
How do you know?
Stop fidgeting.
If you haven't found the bleed yet, it can't be...
There's edema and localized swelling in the section of the temporal lobe that controls short-term memory.
Also, the penis size cortex is set to "pathetic. "
I wanted to see her naked.
Seriously, what were you hiding?
Some guys get upset when you objectify their girlfriends.
But if you're okay, I got a digital video camera, so we could...
Why would I be upset that you're treating my girlfriend like you treat every other woman on the planet?
Unless you're not.
Unless it's deeper than that.
You weren't objectifying her.
Trust me, I want to do some very nasty, demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.
You have feelings for her.
This is bad.
This isn't just a boo-boo.
And you'd never risk your life for them.
Recovery's too fast.
What, the fact that he's getting better is evidence that we're wrong?
I need to sit.
Recovery slow enough for you now?
Wouldn't explain the paralysis.
We've scanned his head five times.
You're bleeding.
It could be hidden in his optic chiasm.
It's coming from your ear.
Think that's a good thing?
But that would have affected his eyesight.
I need to take a bath.
Hallucinations and smells were kind of working, right?
Sensory deprivation should get the brain into an alpha-theta phase.
Didn't you see Altered States?
That movie was released in 1980.
No, I just remembered how old I am.
I need to give my brain time to transition so I can embrace my inner monkey.
"Wasn't born yet" means I won't be entertained by further reference.
I didn't know you rode the bus.
I used to drive home after getting drunk, but some mothers got mad-d.
What are you doing here?
You weren't on the bus with me.
If it's a fantasy, you'd be wearing this.
You're convinced your patient is dying and you wanna waste your time with a sex fantasy?
Don't blame me, blame my gender.
Why can't you do both?
Your patient was driving the bus, so all you could see was him sitting down, most likely facing forward.
Or syphilis.
What if his earlobes were just drooping?
Ehlers-Danlos?
Or Cutis Laxa.
It's not fatal in adults.
Yes, he's an adult, very good point, keep going.
I'm distracting you.
Was it the blood dripping from my ear?
I could have had a subtle hemiballismus, indicating the early stages of Huntington's.
Huntington's wouldn't explain the abdominal pain, and it's only on the table because we're thinking of Thirteen.
A shuffling gait could suggest Parkinson's.
Except there's no such thing as "shuffling sitting. "
I'm the answer.
Here.
You were right.
Help him up.
Get that out of my face.
I remember puking on Cuddy's shoes.
Yeah, skull fractures tend to hurt.
Means I was wrong.
My patient doesn't have Parkinson's.
Cuddy knows that's the only reason I wouldn't want to stay here with my pain pills, porn and you forever.
Vomiting means your brain injury is getting worse.
Foreman.
And if she's wrong, that makes this phone call that much more exciting.
What about hepatic fibrosis?
Did I mention this diagnosis needs to make sense?
How many more bagels do I have to eat for this to work?
Stop looking around suspiciously.
To answer your next two questions, no, I am not there, and yes, you are completely predictable.
If the test had worked, you would have called to put my delicate brain at ease.
I told you not to lock the door.
Still wiping.
Put the phone up to bus driver's grill.
Who are you talking to?
My large colon.
TPP's not consistent with your patient's labored breathing.
Patient has labored breathing because he's been on a treadmill for the last thirty minutes.
Did you take my cell phone?
Can't wheeze without moving your chest muscles.
So why haven't you pushed a vial of tPA?
You let him back in?
Wait, wait.
Look at his teeth.
Dr. Hadley, open the door.
I'm not plumping his pillows here,
I'm putting him in the Trendelenburg position, move the bubble to the apex of his heart so you can suck it out.
Stab his heart!
The other nurse always used to tuck me in.
I'm not sleepy, Mommy.
Me neither.
Technically, you're stalking me.
What is that?
A mosquito?
So there's something wrong, there's some detail I'm not noticing that's spoiling the big picture.
Guess that depends.
What are you going to do with that?
I have to tie this around you.
I'm cold.
Stay with me.
Why did I say that?
It's not over.
I saved the wrong person.
This wasn't just a dream, or a fantasy, or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland.
The crash caused the bubble to dislodge.
Elevated heart rate, BP, which is exactly why you need to stop.
Instead of sleeping, I'm going to be pacing around this apartment, trying to decipher those visions.
Contextual memory, I need to get back on that bus with all 31 passengers to remember who and what I saw.
I'm not gonna call in crash victims because you've gone insane.
Maybe I don't need the actual victims.
Goth Kid, at the back, on the right.
If you'd stop talking, the re-enactment could stimulate activity in my hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex.
What did you see?
Just slipped away.
Is that Vicodin?
And blow out your heart.
House, this isn't worth...
Why are you here?
You believe in reason above all else.
That's asking, not telling.
Resin.
Why the guessing game?
But you know the clues.
I know what's bugging your subconscious.
What's my necklace made of?
Who am I?
It doesn't make sense.
What's my necklace made of?
Amber.
I have to tie this around you.
I'm cold.
Sir, are you all right?
Are you all right?
Are you injured anywhere?
They'll take care of you over there.
He's coming out of it.
Amber.
It was Amber.
Have you spoken to her?
She's probably working, she's been on-call.
Jane Doe #2.
Female, late 20s, kidney damage.
Does Amber have a birthmark on her right shoulder blade?
She was on the bus with me.
She's the one who's dying.
Mahalo, my dear.
You got to love a place where you get lei'd coming and going.
And I got some good color, right bro?
Looking like George Hamilton.
Three coach, one first class.
You weren't supposed to get any first class.
Forget that.
So who gets the extra leg room?
We'll settle it democratically.
Democratically implies that everyone deserves a voice.
My contention is broke-ass Turtle does not.
Yeah, well my contention is Vince is the king, and if he says I get a voice then let me be heard.
Come on, now you're gonna make us feel bad.
So how do we decide?
- It might be subconsciously, but you do.
I have one first class ticket, both of these gentlemen want it.
Will you decide?
What the hell?
Fucking foreign cabbie.
Johnny, what's the big deal?
- Fucking cunts.
And a fucking aisle seat, which they fucking had none.
Sir, will you switch with me?
My pleasure.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm sorry if I seem rude.
Oh, thanks.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just broke up with my boyfriend.
Scotch.
Watch this.
- How about we make it a double?
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.
- Morning, Bradley
What do you got, Lloyd?
Joke all you want, but you are the cheater now, Ari.
- How was Geneva?
Sorry I didn't bring you back a Toulouse-Lautrec dildo,
Well, Us Weekly didn't send this fax.
What fax?
A $10 million offer from John Ellis.
What do you have to say now?
I don't know what to say.
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.
So it's cool if I call you?
Wait a couple of days.
What kind of world am I living in?
Turtle flies first and has airport farewell scenes with Meadow Soprano.
He has been over there dragging out that goodbye for a while.
Whatever he struck up, she should be sick of it by now.
What are you doing, Drama?
Just taking precautionary measures.
Economy class is a killer that counts the blood clot as a friend.
I don't know, I guess.
You guys ready to roll?
- Don't do what?
- See what he's doing?
He's being coy as if he's got a shot.
- Did you get her number?
You fucking a Martian is less ridiculous, put it that way.
- You guys are mean.
- Really mean.
Oh, poor little Turtle's sensitive 'cause he can't get a hot famous actress.
99% of the world's average looking citizens can't get that, Turtle, so don't feel bad.
You're living in a fantasy.
Reality is when he calls her she tries to lure him away from Vince to be her bitch.
Reality is what happened over the Pacific, you angry old fuck.
Yeah, and what's that?
I'm always doing great, E. You know that.
- Yeah, well he's still our agent, Josh.
- For the moment he is.
But Ari will officially become head studio fascist tomorrow.
Frank Darabont.
- Vince a fan?
- Who isn't?
Yeah, Shawshank almost makes me wish I did prison time.
Anyway, he's got a new project he's working on.
I got him to sit down with Vince to talk about the lead.
10 million, Ari?
You were hoping for six or seven, tops.
And I keep sinking my own money into this place.
- E's on the phone.
- Call him back.
- Says it's urgent.
I know, I put the call through.
I've been putting your calls through for three years now, and I haven't interrupted or given you my opinion, even when I know I can steer your twisted mind into greener pastures.
But I can't keep my mouth shut anymore.
- That's because it's filled with...
And I've lived with it because I want to learn and I believed that someday you would promote me.
Lloyd, this is gonna be a good thing for you as well.
If you think working for some conglomerate is gonna fulfill you, then fine, but please don't think I'd ever make myself a corporate bitch.
And by the way, even if I did, your little gay quips would not be tolerated in a publicly-traded company.
People need you here, Ari
I'll leave you with that.
You throw a lot of Jew guilt for a Chinaman.
He's got a point, Ari.
No homosexual harassment?
No, being your own boss.
That's why you put up with all the stress, because nobody can tell you what to do.
You always tell me what to do.
So tell me what to do.
I can't decide this for you, Ari.
- How?
- By flipping a coin.
You flipped a coin to decide whether to marry me or not?
I was joking, baby.
Heads I leave, tails I stay.
Well?
Two out of three.
I feel like we're cheating on Ari.
Well, the guy won't call us back, what are we supposed to do?
Except you, who gets taken care of by Meadow Soprano.
Come on, Johnny, leave him alone already.
How you gonna verify it, Drama?
I got a friend, an FBI friend who will come down here and administer a lie detector test.
I'm not taking a lie detector test.
How about if we get him on that Moment of Truth show?
- Yeah, at least then he'd make a buck.
- Not if he keeps lying.
I'm not doing anything to prove anything to you guys, understood?
You guys need anything?
Well, this guy got jerked off by Meadow Soprano, so he's all good.
I don't think he believes you either.
- Let's sit, shall we?
- Absolutely.
Loser.
So how long have you and Josh been working together?
- Oh, we don't work together.
Yeah, absolutely.
Anyway, the really cool thing is we get to shoot for 14 weeks in the Greek islands.
In this, you mean?
There are no male roles in it under 45.
Oh, I thought Josh said you wanted to talk to me about the lead.
And you didn't tell them this?
No, he didn't tell us anything, Frank.
That's 'cause he's a scumbag.
Just like your old man, aren't you, Josh?
Your clients keep calling, Ari.
- Can't stall forever.
- Tell them I'll call them back.
You've grown cold, Ari Gold.
I've got something that might warm him up.
You cougarlicious little freak.
Just so you know, I'm paying 10 cents on the dollar for your share of this company.
- Dana Gordon's on one.
- Put her through.
Any shot you could pay me in euros?
You are a fucking asshole.
How can I leave such a charming man?
You'll always be my number one whore, Dana.
That should work out well for you and yours.
- Fuck me.
- I'll second that.
I'm so happy, Ari.
- Do I look happy!
- What's wrong?
Has so much come been squirted into those eyes you can't see what's right in front of your face?
Amanda Daniels takes that job, Vince is fucked and I'm fucked.
Which means we're all fucked.
Not a word to anyone, Lloyd.
This is not TV, Vince.
I thought it would be more impactful if you heard it straight from Frank.
What the hell's so wrong with doing TV?
Nothing for David Hasselhoff or for you.
But for Vince, doing TV is ridiculous.
Yeah, but you doing Jamie-Lynn Sigler isn't?
- Oh, here we go.
- You did Jamie-Lynn Sigler?
- Yeah, you believe it?
Vince, there's lots and lots of money in TV.
I don't want to get stuck playing the same character for the next five years.
That was before he was George Clooney.
No one goes backwards 'cause you don't get back to movies.
You didn't see Leo in the Growing Pains reunion.
Well, maybe it's time for you to think about that part of your life being over.
Maybe you're not gonna be a movie star anymore.
Look, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm just telling you what nobody else in this town has the balls to.
My car is over there.
- Well, I'm here for us, really.
- I'd rather suck a rabid dog's dick.
- Clever, but seriously.
Seriously, Ari, what about us would you like to talk about?
That's why I'm putting all my support behind you for the studio head job.
I don't need your support.
That may be true, but you're gonna need me to bow out of the race.
Ari, I have never needed and will never need anything from you.
I don't think he's good enough.
- You did represent him at one point.
Neither is groveling, and I'm not bitter.
But I'm not making deals with you.
Then unfortunately I'm gonna have to stand in your way.
And we both know that you've already fucked all of yours.
So maybe you could move on to bigger and better.
Look, you're gonna have to find another way to bring your once-upon-a-time-movie-star client back from the dead.
- Not bitter, huh?
- Fuck you, Ari.
You can kiss your relationship with that studio goodbye.
Tell him I'm gonna close this motherfucking deal.
Let's not let Josh Weinstein get us upset.
An Academy Award nominee thinks I should do TV.
He didn't say he thinks you should do TV.
He said you'd be great for his TV show if he can get you, which he can't.
- That's a good point.
If Ari takes the studio job you got Smokejumpers.
And once you kill it in that, you'll be back and bigger than ever.
Yeah, well, maybe that's 'cause you unloaded a ton of bullshit earlier.
But there is a problem with the thought.
And when he goes from seller to buyer, he's gonna start analyzing all sorts of new angles.
You're really making us all feel good today, huh?
Just keeping it real.
We'll have to ambush him then.
So you ready to become part of all this?
Oh, I'm ready.
You look awful, Lloyd.
I feel awful, E.
- So it's official?
- He's signing the papers now.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Made you laugh.
I guess this is congrats.
- Wow, you sold me out.
- Oh, go ahead and be mad.
But I've grown four new ulcers keeping your secret.
Come on in, guys.
Offered TV by who?
Not by my people.
Wow, you guys really are melting down.
Did you ever think there was a possibility that I wouldn't?
I just want to get my life back on track.
- You didn't take it?
- No, I'm still your agent.
Are you guys happy or is the movie more important to you than me?
Of course we're happy.
Put her through.
And I swear, I'll rub your cock like it's 1990.
- Jesus Christ.
- Hi, Dana.
We all wanted to be in the room to celebrate together.
Celebrate what?
Boys, you are talking to the new head of the studio.
Madam President, what's your first order of business?
- And she's gonna pay you your quote.
- It's the second lead.
- You're gonna pay him his quote or Vincent Chase is going to announce on TMZ that the new head of the studio calls agencies and offers up handjobs.
All right, enough, Ari.
Vince, I will take good care of you.
- I love you too, Ari.
For real this time.
I pulled off the old bait and switch.
They wanted your old friend Amanda, and I gave them my old friend Dana.
All right, to things being back on track.
- I don't believe it.
- What?
Your girlfriend is here.
Don't embarrass me.
How does he know Jamie?
Thanks a lot, Drama.
Jamie-Lynn, wait, wait, wait.
Look, I'm sorry.
Turtle didn't do anything.
Well, he obviously told you.
No, I made it up.
That's nice of you to try and cover for your friend.
But the fact is I jerked him off and he told you.
I actually liked him and would have fucked him too if he would have kept his mouth shut.
What happened?
Turtle, I am so sorry, man.
She actually liked you.
- Really?
Glasses up.
At least you got a nice jerk, huh?
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen, which in turn....
You do know what a bond is?
A strong force of attraction.
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.
Chemical bonds are what make matter matter.
Bonds.
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.
There are right answers and wrong answers.
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White, two points?
Couldn't you please just let this slide?
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
Yo. lf I know you, leave a message.
Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.
Look, I will be leaving this phone on for another 1 5 minutes, so call me.
Well, don't.
Just let it go.
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop with the pounding, please?
I very much need to get inside here, so if you have a master key....
Look, the person who lives here it's just very important for me to see him.
Which means...?
-Look, I'm his father, all right?
Sorry.
Come on in, Dad.
You know, that blinking thing I've been calling you on?
Whatever, man.
This business.
I didn't say I killed him.
Tell me what happened.
Dude's wife crushed his head with an ATM machine.
So you did not kill anyone?
Does anybody think that you killed anybody?
I called the cops.
You called the cops?
God, she was-- She was so zapped out of her mind.
I mean, he told her she was a skank, but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.
She couldn't identify her left ass cheek.
She was so zonked.
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy on the mechanics here but could you not stop this woman from killing this man?
Look, she had a gun on me, all right?
Yo. lf I know you, leave a message.
Let's do some business, yo.
So are you gonna get back up on that horse?
I just want to forget. I just....
Sorry.
Jesus Malverde, patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.
Well, yeah, hell, I know who it is, okay?
I'm just-- l'm just saying, why's he on your desk?
Going after neo-Nazis, you don't wear swastikas, right?
-Sun Tzu.
"If you know your enemy as yourself you'll fight without danger in many battles."
Right on.
"Fat Man and Little Boy." Sounds like you two.
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.
You watch it.
I'm Heisenberg.
Let's get this over with.
Real cool.
-l'm just saying....
What have you heard?
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."
Usually I gotta chase dudes down for their money but today everybody's paying up.
You didn't hear that from me.
-Several months.
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I-- l think he'll remember me.
-You look great.
I miss him.
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
I was applying for the data-entry job.
You're kidding.
Skyler, you were, like, our go-to bookkeeper.
How about get your old job back?
We're expanding, and, well, between you and me the whole department's pretty much of a mess.
Your work would be cut out for you but we could use your help.
What does that look like to you?
Double, triple your crew.
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?
We go rolling into these neighborhoods other crews ain't gonna take kindly, you understand?
Sure, they won't like it but I say they're not gonna do a thing about it.
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.
Somebody crossed you, you got angry you crushed their skull with an ATM machine.
-That's not how it happened.
You are a blowfish.
Small in stature, not swift, not cunning.
So that it makes him intimidating, that's why.
You see, it's just all an illusion.
Yes, it is. lt's nothing but air.
Now who messes with the blowfish, Jesse?
Blowfishing this up.
It means, "Let's make a deal."
Right here.
"Item SS4G:
Yankee Stadium final season commemorative baseball hand-signed by Derek Jeter."
We'll get you three.
White boy don't like let's make a deal, huh?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.
I take my time, but I always win.
Good likeness.
They keep him busy every second.
Wow, that sounds exciting.
Speaking of riding desks got myself a job today.
You did not.
As big as you are?
-Thank you.
It will not happen again.
Is money that tight?
You know we can always help out.
-Everything okay?
-Everything's perfect.
Where?
Beneke.
I'm back working in the Accounting Department.
I didn't smell anything when I was in there.
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?
The son.
Anyway, I have got to go.
I don't wanna be late my first day back.
You left your cave.
Make a hell of a tat.
That's the plan.
Really?
I work part-time, down at the ABQ lnk.
Yo, you're a real good drawer.
I used to do a little of that.
You used to be a drawer too, huh?
What stopped you?
That's way too big a commitment.
Maybe a little Sharper Image or Pottery Barn?
Hey, is that your guy?
Hey, I think that's your guy.
What the hell is he doing down there?
Schrader, where you going?
Our territory.
We're staking our claim that we sell when we want, where we want.
Now, we're gonna be kings, understand?
Straight up, straight up.
Well, we're set.
Cheddar, Mr. White.
Fat stacks, dead presidents, cash money.
Gonna own this city.
We're not charging enough.
What?
You corner the market, then raise the price.
Simple economics.
Wow, Ted, it's a little early for wine, isn't it?
Hey, how is Denise doing?
We split up, about a year ago.
I'm sorry.
Sure.
It's Jesse Pinkman.
And that guy you met he's not my dad.
You're not gonna kick me out, are you?
Because I actually really like it here.
I don't make it my business what you do.
So long as you don't do it here.
So, hey, I got this kick-ass new flat-screen.
Wanna see?
Nana.
Nana, please wake up.
- Tell that to The Science Times, all right?
Good morning.
It's rare, but highly enjoyable.
It's all right, honey.
You know the story of the little boy who cried wolf?
He said the wolf was there when it wasn't, so no one helped him when the wolf really came.
I'm Jack Garcia, and this is what I know.
You're saying I burned down a man's house so I could report on it?
Well, aren't you in the running for some big new cable show?
Cal?
And now his boy is accusing me of burning down his house?
He may not be able to tell the difference between fantasy and reality.
You think Caden shot him?
Caden was seen arguing with Dante at a party last week.
Dante is part of Little Sid's entourage.
He's a rival rapper.
I don't talk to cops, man.
Mr. Davis, your cousin doesn't want to cooperate, we'll bring him in.
I can dig it.
My cousin and I were here, watching the Carver-Nova game.
Okay, but why would a killer show remorse for his victim?
Have you ever seen Santa?
Jack Garcia wasn't the only person that Frank Ambrose owed money to.
- I think I know why Maggie's so angry.
- Were you having an affair with Jack Garcia?
How dare you accuse me of having an affair in front of my son.
Yeah, you're avoiding the question.
Nine months ago I was out shopping and Jack walked up to me in the store.
Well, you wanted to know why I never cheated on you.
What about you?
I think that's what we should focus on here.
Affairs make for angry spouses, right?
What could possibly make me want to burn down the Ambroses' house?
Your husband was having an affair with Cheryl Ambrose.
It's not something I wanted to see in the papers.
She's still angry.
The Jack Garcia you see on TV is not the man I married.
But marriage is about... figuring out how to make it through when things change.
Are you saying that I'm the one that changed?
I know, but I can tell you, sweetheart, there really is such a thing as too much honesty in a marriage.
Come up to me like, "Little Sid, please take me away from this paper rapper. "
All right, take a look at these.
Well, A.J. believes his story is true... the same way he believes in Santa Claus.
One of them may be using their son to frame that man.
That fire killed my mother.
People have done crazier things at the end of an affair.
Cheryl was having an affair with Jack?
I would never put my family at risk like that.
That's a shame, but it'll help me make the case against Frank.
You just got to telling him about it now?
I've gotta get back to the office.
Have a wonderful dinner, sweetheart.
You must've been pretty angry when you found out Dante was gay, huh?
But your music's full of hate for gays.
- So you had a grudge?
That's true, love.
Your mum.
Oh, get out of here.
Not so good, eh?
Did you see them together, love?
You weren't supposed to know about any of this, but I was never gonna leave you.
You burnt down the house to save your family, didn't you?
You set the fire and- and told your brother it was Mr. Garcia, right?
Nobody's going anywhere.
We tell ourselves we can protect them, try to shield them, but in the end, they see everything.
Caden's not gonna talk to the cops again.
Yeah, I thought so.
I had nothing to do with Dante's death.
You didn't, did you?
Caden, you don't get any of this if they know the truth about you.
Is it this one?
But you didn't stay around and interview the victims.
How did it go with Zoe?
Jay, I'm home.
I don't know, but I'm afraid to move.
Oh, yeah, right, 'cause the last time she was here, the refrigerator magnets rearranged themselves... into a penta
- Grandma!
And living in Sedona has been transformational.
- The incident.
I wanted a big, beautiful wedding with Jay... because my ex-husband and I got married... in a tiny little office of a judge in Colombia.
My mother wanted to go to the wedding to show everyone how okay she was with all of it, so I convinced Dad and Gloria to invite her.
To the bride and the groom- my ex.
Your father and I are not about to let you drive two hours to go to a concert... and then spend the night with a bunch of boys, especially that 17-year-old hormone you're dating.
Oh, this just gets better and better.
Why are you always on me about everything?
- I met a man.
Give it time, and see Banff.
Cam, please.
I need your help, Mitchell.
That's not weird at all.
Mom, I- [Chuckles] I'm just not really sure what you're asking me to do, Mom.
I call it "peerenting."
I learned it from my own dad, who used to walk into my room... and say, "What's up, Sweathog?"
How's it going with you and Dylan?
How very nice of her to say that through you.
Uh, like a lumberjack?
No, he logs blood samples into a cholesterol study.
Ricky was your mother's boyfriend, and he looked like Charles Manson.
We were doing nothing, and he was a very sweet boy, which you might have known if you bothered to get to know him.
I don't judge people before I get a chance to know them.
Mom makes a mess, and there's Mitchell to clean it up.
- He set a kid's bike on fire.
[Chuckling] Not your worst.
So, you'll talk to Gloria about Mom coming to dinner?
Oh, Gloria would never go for that in a million years.
That's not very nice.
That's why you're going to pull a fast one on her, and I'm not going to like it one bit.
You got that from "Hey"?
- Mitchell told you I'd be here.
I was struggling with being alone.
Meanwhile, Jay moves on so easily, and-and not with just anyone- with a... young... and smart and beautiful woman.
We grew apart for years, and you left to find yourself, remember?
I don't know what just happened.
I mean, it seems pretty simple to me.
In my house, we don't even talk to each other.
You know, it's funny- the first time I saw Haley, I knew I liked her.
I mean, she's beautiful and everything, but it's-it's not just that.
It's that she's got this killer confidence- you know, the kind of confidence that you get from having a family like this... that's passionate... and accepting of hot foreigners... and gay dudes and nutty people.
You know, a family that actually loves each other.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but maybe we should let her go with him.
It's called "In the Moonlight."
Lovely title, Dylan.
Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.
- We do?
You're kidding.
But I need to know whether you're looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
Okay, just to be clear, there's only one correct answer, right?
I mean, it's not like "Chicken or fish?" on an airplane?
Maybe you need to think about it a little.
Three dates means sex?
Who knew?
Greetings, homeys.
Homette.
Why are you back from your date so early?
Well, in romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.
Actually, I've never had three dates with the same woman.
With Penny and me, it took two years.
But now that I think about it, that was three dates.
Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up did she ask for any kind of commitment?
No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.
I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention I will wait for you to finish your conversation.
What are you talking about?
Well, this is very exciting, and I wanted you to be among the first to know-
I hear you're gonna be on the radio with Ira Flatow from Science Friday next week.
Thank you, Kripke for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.
My pleasure.
Well, why are you such a stupidhead?
That is also rhetorical.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
Are you really gonna be on NPR?
Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin ices.
It's much catchier in Hindi.
All right, these are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow.
I need to make sure they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand.
Howard, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.
Yo, Raj, talk to me.
Did she say something?
I do, you know, but she wants a commitment and I'm not sure she's my type.
Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.
Are you high?
You'd have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian from Total Recall.
Okay, now you're just being unrealistic.
You're gonna throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you're holding out for some fantasy?
Hey, just because you settled doesn't mean I have to.
Excuse me, I'm sitting here.
Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.
Again, I'm right here.
Yes, you're delicious caramel too.
Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
Thank you, Sheldon.
Whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is an entirely different question.
IRA This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday.
Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Oh, this is gonna be a riot.
Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?
Of course.
First, consider an ordinary magnet, which has, as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles a north and south pole.
If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets each with its own north and south pole.
Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.
A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will is the existence of such monopoles.
So nice you could join me this evening.
You're looking lovely as always.
Come on, Katee, don't make it sound so cheap.
Thank you.
So, ahem, shall we get started?
Sure, but can I ask you a question first?
You wanna play Cylon and colonist?
No, I wanna know why you're playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.
Of course I mean Bernadette.
She's a wonderful girl and she really likes you.
- I know, but she's not you.
Don't remind me!
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
What do you want?
Did you laugh?
I fell on the floor.
Are you really admitting defeat?
However, on an unrelated topic, I'm never getting out of this bed again.
Okay, that's the spirit but let's dial it back to a nonlethal form of vengeance.
He'll sit down and it'll sound like he's flatulent even though he's not.
Let's keep thinking.
Oh, gee, you're too late.
Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were here trolling around for neurotic little weasels.
Plus, I've been kind of talking some smack about you.
- Hello, Howard.
Bernadette will you marry me?
Is this more comedy that I don't understand?
No, I'm serious.
- So this isn't a joke?
Don't you just hate when this happens?
All right, how's this for revenge?
A solution of hydrogen peroxide and one of saturated potassium iodide.
How are we gonna deploy it in Kripke's office?
At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.
Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.
You flatter me, sir.
I gotta say, I am really impressed.
Here comes Kripke.
Who's that with him?
- How could you not put in an abort?
Right here we have a micro-controlled plasma-
At least they don't know it was you.
Hello, Kripke.
This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper.
If you'd like to see the look on your stupid face this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube.
Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.
What's your plan?
Oh, now what?
Are you sure?
I wanna dedicate this number to a great gal who I've done wrong.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you look like a panty-sniffer.
I'm not getting a shag now I'm a homeless.
You were just using me.
I was a nasty slut.
I went with so many boys and girls, girls and boys at the same time.
I took part in... disgusting, perverted, unnatural acts.
I was drinking and taking drugs.
I used bad language all the time.
But I'm not like that any more.
I'm a good person.
She went to my school.
She's on there for, like, 20 minutes, literally...
I don't even like cheese.
That makes it even worse, you sick bastard.
It's not just her, is it?
Oh, yeah, look there's more.
I know him.
He used to be a right headcase.
Did she tell you that?
We should phone probation headquarters and get them to send someone down here now to supervise us.
Well, this is intense.
Don't, Nathan.
Can you get me a can of Coke?
What?
Don't you have any shame?
And you look like a slut.
Are you for real?
You think having sex with boys will make them respect you?
If you behave like a slut, they'll treat you like a slut.
Freak.
He thinks it's the same for everyone.
It's not, though, is it?
'I did it for you, 'all of you.
'I did it to protect you.'
What you talking about?
Is it?
So do you get any training?
I'm just making conversation.
Oh, haven't seen her, man.
Can I take a message?
You're all right.
What's he doing here?
Who is he?
Morning!
What is up with that?
You want to tell me what's going on?
What's with the makeover?
Well, I shouldn't be masturbating in public toilets.
I'm saving myself until I'm ready to make a proper commitment.
'Lisha, what is this?
Has it got something to do with that lot we saw yesterday?
So pathetic.
We can help you, Curtis.
I'm talking to you!
What's wrong with you?
Nice cardigan!
She's saying all this weird stuff about sex and that.
She says she's saving herself until she's ready to make a proper commitment.
It's a sad day for all of us when a bird like that decides it's time to pull up her knickers.
Have you finished?
The beast is back in his cage.
How d'you know that?
You don't know that?
Did you just suddenly grow a set of balls?
Alisha?
What are you doing?
Alisha!
Get off me!
I got pizza.
I'm just screwing around.
Just leave it, then.
Ah, don't put it on my pizza.
Why are you sleeping with a crusty sock in your bed?
Maybe that's your power.
I am very good at it.
You know why it is, though?
Because you can't improve on perfection.
Look, but don't touch.
I didn't mean it like that.
So... do you wanna steal some booze?
I should really have my own keys cut for the bar.
What's she saying to them?
Did she just...virginise him?
You mean one of these ribbons?
Have you seen Curtis?
They got him last night in the community centre.
What are the aims of your organisation?
We're trying to encourage self-respect, responsible behaviour, respect for the law.
What's so wrong with being good?
Do you have a message for the young people watching?
All this drinking, and the drugs and the anti-social behaviour.
Where is she?
Ah, there's never a probation worker around when you need one.
Who's Barry?
You are.
Sorry, man.
Oh, shit!
She's vexing them with some kind of Derren Brown voodoo mind shit.
We need to gear up.
What are you doing?
You gotta have the right track for this kind of thing.
Let's do it.
Have you seen Alisha?
I have just shat my guts out.
What are you two up to?
I got to go to the chemists.
I'll catch you later, big boy.
She's trying to take me somewhere!
They're trying to take Alisha.
They're everywhere!
Just back the fuck up!
Get on!
Fuck you!
Who are you?
Call me, yeah?
Graffiti isn't art, it's vandalism.
Kelly?
Kelly?
Nathan?
Oh, no.
That's a good thing.
I didn't like who I was.
Nathan.
There's only one thing young ladies should be inserting in themselves... and that's knowledge.
Please excuse me.
This is ridiculous!
You think I won't do this?
Kelly?
Where are you gonna go?
Nathan, please just let her go.
And that's what it's all about - breaking eggs!
We fucked up bigger and better than any generation that came before us.
We were so beautiful!
And I will shag my own mother before I let her... or anyone else take that away from me!
Your gun's leaking.
I still can't hear you.
Save me, Barry!
Where's Nathan?
We should go celebrate.
Can we just go for a drink?
To Nathan.
Prick.
'There was nothing I could do.
I'm gonna go too.
I know what film you saw last summer.
I wasn't ready.
So do we have a deal?
Classic!
Ah, I'm alive.
I'm immortal.
Help!
Help!
I'm alive!
You buried me alive, you dicks!
Help!
I'm immortal.
My best friend is a spy?
This is the best news I've ever heard!
Dismissed.
Lieutenant Alexander Coburn?
Thank you for your service, Lieutenant, but you have not qualified for training with Special Operations Command.
I'm sorry, Colonel?
I know it's silly, but they remind me of home.
Go ahead and keep them.
I have a feeling you're gonna be out here a while.
How would you feel if I told you that there was a covert black ops team of America's finest snipers, rangers and men willing to do anything to protect this country, and that team wanted you?
I'd say that sounds like a dream come true, sir.
And I'd say you have quite a choice to make.
Either go home to your family or you become the soldier you always dreamed you could be.
So, tell me, Lieutenant Coburn are you ready to die today?
I'm glad you took my call.
In a matter of hours, General Beckman is gonna give you and your team a Trace Cell Mission to test the CIA's security system.
I need you to pick something up for me while you're there.
Coming in from behind me, closer, closer now.
Whoever finds this video, I want you to...
Oh, it's just you, Chuck.
A little spy work.
Working on what?
You'll need to break through 15 levels of security to get there.
Will Shaw be joining us?
It's not a mission, Chuck.
This time it's personal.
My work is here, Chuck, so, please, stay focused.
That's the door to level two.
Pace yourself, Chuck, we've got 14 more levels.
That was manageable.
Now, Walker, watch the door.
Hey, uh, shouldn't we stick together?
No, always gotta have somebody watch your back.
I literally just watched you close it.
Hey, hey, look, if you're working on some secret side mission, tell me.
Yeah, well, so did I, but I think it all hit her today that it meant leaving L.A. and leaving you.
Now, she's gonna come to you and I need you to back me up on this, bro.
Is Devon here?
Chuck, I got it.
Doctors Without Borders is the only thing that Devon has been excited about in weeks.
Yeah, well, you know, sometimes your dream job isn't always what you expect it to be.
Unfortunately, your mission at the CIA facility was a day too late.
The vault had already been compromised and a new drug called Laudanol was stolen.
Military scientists were able to create a prototype pill that could suppress emotions in battlefield soldiers, make them stronger, faster, fearless.
Wait a minute, no fear?
Could that help me flash?
Well, maybe, but then you wouldn't feel anything, Chuck.
Right, but I could work... perfectly.
We'll never know unless we get it back.
We think this might have been an inside job.
Only a handful of our people knew the Laudanol was being kept in box 092407.
Oh, yes.
This is a test, right?
Are you positive you saw Colonel Casey take the pill, Mr. Bartowski?
John Casey is one of the most loyal spies out there.
What are you doing?
Agent Walker, please relieve the colonel of his weapon.
John, you want to tell me what's going on?
This is not that.
This is, uh, this spy related, okay?
Did you happen to record Casey's conversation last night?
That would depend.
No, don't worry, don't worry, you're not in trouble.
I actually need your help.
A man enters Casey's apartment.
Is that static?
Carrots actually.
Hey, show some respect.
Okay, then we've got to break him out before then and clear his name.
If we do this, and if we get caught, we're gonna be tried for treason, and you're gonna lose everything and you're never going to get a chance to be a real spy.
Is that what you want?
It's Casey.
You sure you're okay missing your flight to D.C.?
All right then.
Time to save the day.
Well, that wasn't there before.
I see you've encountered my new security measures.
Yeah, really excellent work.
You deserve a medal for adjusting all these security measures so quickly.
That's incredible.
Uh, we're secure.
But if we do Doctors Without Borders, we could save lives.
We can save lives here in L.A. next to my brother.
Well, then I guess we'll go talk to Chuck.
Médecins Sans Frontières, USC neurology is every good doctor's fellowship at USC, dream job. which is, like, my dream job.
Devon, it appears to me you're being completely selfish.
Morgan, sidebar now.
Just a sec, babe.
If you had all the intel I had, you'd know that it is, in fact, the safest place for her to be.
Yes, but Chuck's job can sometimes be more demanding than most would expect.
Man, it is so cool, huh?
Ellie, I've been thinking, kids in L.A., eh, they don't need your help.
You know, with their fancy designer jeans and Lady Gaga sunglasses.
I say far, far away is where a doctor could do the most good.
I think that you should go and do Doctors Without Borders, all right?
Yeah, yeah, I read and file all of your mission reports.
Right now I'm-I'm really interested in how you've secured this holding cell.
I'm the newest security measure.
I have the only key card in the whole building.
We don't have time for this.
There, look, Casey.
I really hope that wasn't me.
Let's go, John.
Worry about finding the Ring later.
His real name is Alex Coburn.
We've unsealed his file and this is what we've learned.
Alex Coburn faked his death in Honduras in 1989, the same day that John Casey was recruited for NSA Black Ops by a Colonel James Keller.
Keller must've recruited him again and this time for the Ring.
And it's crucial the Laudanol doesn't fall into their hands.
The only reason you're not in federal prison right now is because I have a mission only you can accomplish.
Find and capture Colonel John Casey.
Dead or alive.
This is some kind of mission, isn't it?
Yeah, that's right.
How would you like to be a part of a very important, very secret mission?
Yeah, yeah, can I get a cool call name like Condor or Lady Fingers?
Three years... three years of missions, training, I'm his friend.
How can all of that have been a lie?
I don't know, some people change.
You move forward as a spy, and the line between what's right and wrong becomes more and more gray.
You don't know what to believe in or... who to believe in.
I thought you had changed.
What do you mean?
I know that you want to be the perfect spy, and I know what it means to you and what you've sacrificed to get there.
But please don't lose that guy that I met three years ago.
Don't give up on the things that make you great.
I'll always be that guy.
So, the only reason that Keller would go to all that trouble to break Casey out would be if he still didn't have it.
Which means if we get to it before Casey does, we've got a shot at catching him.
Yeah, except there's nothing left in the apartment.
He knows he would never get past those surveillance cameras undetected.
He would have to use somebody.
And that someone would have to be either desperate, stupid, or just plain willing to do anything to impress him.
Planet of the Apes, huh?
Planning on watching that alone?
Yeah, well, you know me, I can't get enough POTA.
I know, it's just so unrealistic!
Morgan, did Casey ask you to come here and get something for him?
That is absurd.
Now you're just making stuff up.
Now you're just trying to...
Listen, this is my first mission, Chuck, and I don't want to screw it up.
In sordid detail?
Promise.
Sarah, I got it.
Where's Grimes?
You convinced the little rodent to give you the case, didn't you?
I knew he was weak.
Tell me where it is, now.
Don't make me do this, Bartowski.
Don't shoot.
Give me the case and I won't have to.
I believed in you.
I trusted you.
I know that you used to be Alex Coburn.
I know that you work for James Keller, and that you stole the Laudanol for the Ring.
The only thing I don't know is why.
And if I don't turn over the Laudanol to the Ring, they're gonna kill her.
No, we're not gonna let that happen.
Look, just give me the address, I'll sneak her out of there, put her in a safe house.
Hell, you didn't even know I was Alex Coburn until today.
I don't care who you were.
I know who you are.
And you're not in this alone.
Let's go to a meeting.
Smoke it.
I was just checking your meter here out back, and yeah, I do detect a gas leak.
Well, ignore everything I said previously.
Inside, inside!
I'm sorry, I promise I'm not crazy.
You got the Laudanol?
I knew I could count on you.
Good soldiers always follows orders.
You know, you wouldn't be in this mess if you'd done what I told you 20 years ago.
What the hell is this?
Your breath stinks.
You think you're just going to walk out of here?
I got five men outside.
Five against one.
They're already at the house.
Look, anything immediate, you're gonna have to handle yourself.
Yeah, well, everything is immediate!
Take the pill, Chuck.
What pill?
The Laudanol was developed to calm emotions, eliminate fear.
I just checked the meter, everything's fine.
You're not from the gas company.
I'm not afraid... of any of you.
Do I know you?
I've got one more mission.
I think I'm going really be able to help people.
You don't have to explain.
You love what you do and you're good at it.
I just want you to know, if something happens to me, no matter what, I love you.
Listen, you're never one to get emotional with me, so don't let your guard down now.
That way you can get back to me in one piece.
Got it?
He'll die a hero and be given a hero's funeral.
From this point on, your name is John Casey.
Make it a good life, soldier.
The authorities just arrived, Ms. McHugh.
It's too late now.
I mean, surely you can't just make him start over.
For the final time, you are dismissed.
Good luck, John.
Yes, uh, Chuck has certainly changed, and he is well on his way to becoming the perfect spy.
A while back you requested a transfer out of Burbank, and I haven't forgotten.
There's an empty seat on my flight back to D.C., if you'd still like to go.
We could discuss it on the way.
Your brother, who you never see.
USC neurology- that's kind of been your dream ever since you were a kid, El.
And if there is one thing that I know for sure, it's that I want to be with Devon.
And it might require some sacrifice from both of us, but he's the best choice I ever made.
There you are, El.
And that was only my first mistake.
But I should have talked to you first.
If this is important to you, then it is important to me.
I'm sorry I lost sight of that.
Babe, take the job.
We'll make it work.
See?
It'll be great for civilian life.
I mean, take a look around.
You know, you can still go back.
The general made the terms of my dismissal crystal clear.
I was talking about Kathleen.
You know I made my decision between love and love of country a long time ago.
And it was the right decision for me.
Now you have to make a decision whether that's the right one for you.
Walker's a good woman.
It's still not too late.
D.C.'s beautiful this time of year.
You from this area?
You don't know, do you?
What the hell is this?
Kellan Ashby.
He's a shot caller and he wants me to kill Jimmy to get him back.
I need you to deliver him to me alive.
McGee, I don't know if he's got the heart for this.
We want in on the Dungloe run.
SAMCRO's coming on the run.
Let's get it done right this time.
Arrange things at the barn.
Good morning.
I'm sorry about Patrick.
Jimmy killed your brother and five members of my club.
That blast was meant for Sam Crow.
Greed pushed him over the line.
This betrayal means he's gone rogue.
I need to know where to find Jimmy.
You do it with the full support of the Army.
And what about my kid?
With Jimmy out of the way... your son will return to his loving family.
Like I got a choice.
You'll need to find someone working with Jimmy, the closer the better.
I got a few ideas.
Once you, uh, find the right man, give Sean a ring.
You'll find he's quite resourceful.
So, what's the fallout?
If Kellan proves to the council at the attacker was you, I don't know how we're going to spin it.
Yeah, you did, but the ones who chained up that barn thought they were killing traitors.
When the truth comes out, then you become the traitor.
We can feed our boys any truth that we need.
Only one that can prove that I was connected to that blast is O'Neill, so you and I are going to go and tie up that loose end, yeah?
Hey, I went looking for you last night.
What should I do?
I guess you weren't lying.
We got ourselves a doctor and a hospital boss.
What did I just say, bitch?
So she's the boss?
Give them a number, Tara.
Kellan needs us to prove Jimmy blew up that gun truck.
And what about Abel?
Same promise.
Get Jimmy, we get Abel.
It had to be him.
O'Neill's their officer.
We call him out as a rat, we pretty much condemn the whole charter.
Maybe it's time we look at that.
Aye, you're right about O'Neill.
The Irish became more important than the patch.
Well, that's not what you told me.
'Cause I like to give my boys the benefit of the doubt, Clay.
But after yesterday, there's no doubt left.
He's gone, his flat's empty, and he's got to be with Jimmy.
Alright, great.
So I guess it's the truth we're after.
Liam's in some trouble, Cherry.
I know what that means.
You going to kill him?
He'll get his say.
Just tell them what you know, sweetheart.
I don't know anything.
I mean, the club is his only family.
Let's go turn over his apartment.
Hold on.
You hear what happened to Half-Sack?
You know O'Neill's connected to that, right?
Bullshit.
No, she's right.
You know, Liam was privy to your man getting a knife in the belly.
And your protecting this guy makes you just as guilty.
He turned on his brothers, and he bailed on you.
Just tell them what you know, Cher.
All right.
Deed served its purpose.
You did good, brother.
Now tell me where you're at so me and Donny can come and collect you.
Are you a member?
Trusted friend.
Put a goddamn member on the phone!
The guy pointing a gun at Jax Teller's old lady.
He wants us to kill Alvarez and steal a quarter of a mil from his home safe.
This dude's gone off the deep end, man.
We don't deliver in 12 hours, they're both dead.
We need to handle this.
We got to reach out to Alvarez, get him to play along.
Don't let that horse truce fool you.
The Mayans hate us.
What else are we gonna do?
Better be right.
Come on, let's go.
Where the hell is he going?
That's got to be him.
Club's handling the traitor issue.
- Good.
'Cause I got a feeling you're gonna need a strong stomach.
Sean Casey's joined the party.
Then we can be sure O'Neill's sharing his most intimate secrets.
All right, lads, let's sort out this lot, yeah?
I need you to tell me who ordered you to blow up that truck, Liam.
I didn't blow it up.
Can't watch this.
This is some medieval shit.
I had a detonator.
I waited till Jimmy's boys chained the barn.
McGee's working for Jimmy?
Who else?
Get him!
Turn off the camera.
McGee took off, and Jimmy's crew's heading this way.
Lock the doors.
Make sure Kellan gets this.
No matter what, he keeps his promise about my kid.
The door.
Mother of Christ, let's get to the roof!
Caught you, you bastard.
It's the priest you ought to be hating.
He's playing you, Jackson, he's never gonna give you your son back.
Just tell me why.
Just getting old, Clay.
This life hasn't given me much in the way of retirement.
It's just about the money, brother.
Jimmy got away.
Give me the coat.
Sorry.
Let's get out of here.
This information confirms a suspicion we've had about Jimmy for quite some time.
We know you risked your lives to get it.
We owe you.
How do we get to O'Phelan?
That's an Army matter.
That's not the deal.
I'm afraid it is, Jackson.
Not here.
We'll do that later, son.
Let her breathe.
Your club's cooperating.
I don't know why they're doing this.
I'm sure it's about money.
Yeah, well, then they're out of luck, 'cause the club doesn't have any.
I am sorry this is happening to you.
So am I.
Another life.
What is it?
I was in deep.
Started out just another groupie.
Before I knew it, I was giving him my money, buying him drugs, then dealing for him.
Christmas Eve 1989, we both O.D.'d on fentanyl-laced heroin.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I leave it there so I remember all that shit is behind me.
Casey wouldn't tell me where he was.
Well, the cops found the bodies on the docks, and they're gonna be here asking questions.
We find Abel, catch Oswald's plane tomorrow night, and get the hell off of this musk covered shit hole.
Amen, my brother.
SAMBEL's gathering to take a quick vote and tap Ryan as president.
Give me a minute.
What's the matter?
He sold us out; he got what he deserves.
It's okay to feel bad, baby.
Time don't mean shit.
Who did it?
Who do you think?
Alvarez, we need to talk to you.
What the hell you doing here?
Look, we just need...
Look, we just need to talk to you, okay?
Piney.
Alvarez, he's right, we come in peace.
Peace.
Take Tessa.
How'd you get my address?
Got it from Salazar, man.
You know what he's done?
He's kidnapped Jax's old lady and a woman she works with.
You serious?
He's got a very interesting list of demands.
Salazar wanted us to come here and kill you, and then take that 250K you got hidden in your safe.
You know what I got in that safe?
Two old watches, insurance policies and my kid's baby teeth.
Marcus, we just need 24 hours.
Then you can rise from the dead, and all them vatos will go spooky respect with that shit, you know?
Look, I'm really sorry we upset your family, but we're desperate.
You're the only shot we got at saving those women.
Please.
All right.
I'll play dead 24 hours, and that's it.
Heard you're gonna be leaving.
Hopefully, tomorrow.
I'm sorry about McGee.
Thanks.
Guess he was the closest thing I had to a da.
Where's your old man?
Killed in Lebanon.
I was a baby.
He was a soldier?
I heard they buried Kip with his patch.
That's good.
You don't know the facts.
Do you?
What do you know about desperate?
All our times here are desperate!
SAMCRO has no idea the risk Belfast takes to keep Charming safe and cozy.
Redwood put SAMBEL on the map.
Aye, and after four days you nearly wiped them off.
I'll assume that's the drink talking.
You assume whatever you want.
All I know is, since you and your boys rolled into our alley, we're short three lives.
And I'm missing my grandson, 'cause your asshole brother is playing a shell game with his life.
I should take your right eye for talking shite about a man of God.
It wouldn't be the first thing you took from me.
Well, maybe if you didn't chew men up like a meat grinder, they wouldn't be overseas looking for some tenderness.
I need smokes.
I need whiskey.
I need a new life.
You get the door.
Christ, Ma!
You want to shut the door?
This is very bad.
Agreed.
Little slut.
Well... unless we want a three-headed grandchild, looks like we're gonna have to share some family history.
I don't understand.
You said my da was a soldier.
I know.
He was a member of the club?
Founding member.
Why wouldn't you tell me that?
Why the hell did you lie to me?
I lied to everybody, Triny.
Your nana shipped me off to Dublin to have you in secret.
She wanted me to give you up for Catholic adoption.
I couldn't do that.
Neal Duffy was a lad I knew that was killed in the line of duty.
He was a sweet, noble lad.
I almost shagged my brother, Ma.
You know how humiliating that is?
Sorry, Triny.
Who else knows about this?
Apparently, John didn't tell anyone.
Clay?
Two minutes later, I'd have been dancing in Tig territory.
How'd you find out?
I found a letter that your dad wrote to her.
She was 19.
A fresh start.
Kellan's here.
That priest does not leave this alley until you have an address, you understand me?
Time's up.
Yeah, and you still have some value.
It's done.
I'll call back to arrange a meet.
You want me in there?
The piece.
Where's my kid?
I'm about to break a vow...an oath of confidentiality I had with your father.
What does that have to do with my kid?
Everything.
I got to know J.T. very well.
I loved him like a brother.
Well, that makes sense, considering he had a kid with your sister.
He never wanted this life for you.
Why are you telling me this?
Because he died before he could keep his promise.
Where the hell is my kid?
He's in the arms of a loving family.
You son of a bitch!
You tell me where my son is, or I will kill him.
What sisters?
Private missionaries.
They look for good Catholic homes.
You filthy Judas.
I know you think I'm an evil man... but it's my job to look at the greater good.
With Jimmy, with your child.
That's what leaders do.
Look at the violence in the last three days alone.
Is that the life you want for your child?
Previously on Sons of Anarchy:
I've seen my best friend and my wife growing closer and closer.
I feel nothing, not even fear.
I'll hand deliver Jimmy O'Phelan.
What do you want?
Hey, my club finds out, I'm dead.
It's Gemma's statement about what happened with Polly and Edmond at the safe house.
If you want her clear of the homicide, get her on board.
This is from Stahl, isn't it?
Do not get in bed with this bitch.
I am telling you this is what you need to do to protect SAMCRO.
The ones we've been muling you handguns to?
Aye, you need to kill him before he exiles someplace where we can't find him.
Former high-ranking leaders of the IRA now make up the Ruling Council of the Real IRA.
Do you have any contact with any of these guys?
The Irish gave Jimmy safe passage out of Belfast, in exchange for my kid.
He's up north with the Russians.
Putlova?
You have to trust me.
I can't protect you from Clay if he finds out, and if you go to jail with them knowing you're a rat, you'll be dead in a day.
Morning.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you, too, son.
Yeah, I know that.
I have a feeling...
Whatever happens today, I'm right here.
I know.
I got something for you.
It may be a wee bit small, but...
We're getting married.
I'm just cleaning up.
Gotta go see Otto.
I wouldn't go in there.
Sit for a sec.
What's going on?
Today's about to go off the rails, baby.
We gotta find Jimmy before we go inside.
I know what you have to do.
This is more than retaliation.
We made a deal with the Irish Kings.
Taking out Jimmy gets us access to a much higher level of merchandise.
What Irish Kings?
Real IRA Council.
Same guys got us the deal to get Abel back from Jimmy.
I don't have that many more years at the head of that table.
This is an opportunity for us to finish big.
Set us up for the rest of our lives.
While we're sitting in a cell.
We don't know how any of that shit's gonna shake out.
You're right.
I'll worry about it tomorrow, when they're carting us both off to jail.
I'm sorry.
I'm finishing up the arrangements in Santa Catarina.
Donny's closing things up out here.
He'll be back in a couple hours.
Grand.
Tig, can I show you something?
That ain't funny.
Yes, it is.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna turn myself in.
Yeah, Lenny's, uh, real tight with the Gulag crew in here.
That's, uh, Putlova's muscle.
We need a location today.
Might be able to get a few minutes with him at the fence but that ain't gonna be easy.
We'll try to arrange whatever we can on our end.
Yeah, okay.
You doing okay, bro?
Yeah.
Where's the case at?
P.D.?
There's not much of a defense.
They're gonna plea that down.
I got no brace in here, brother.
I'll, uh, I'll do what I can to get to Lenny, all right?
We'll be fine.
Good luck.
What's this?
Of course, there's still the fleeing custody charge, but with your recent medical flare-up, I got it remanded to house arrest.
You'll wear an ankle bracelet for six months and if you behave, you'll have it off in three.
I'll deny all of it.
So you would sacrifice your life in prison just to undermine my case.
You are going to get him killed.
If not by his own club, then by the IRA.
You kill the deal, or I tell the U.S. Attorney it's all bullshit.
Well, unfortunately, my testimony's already been documented.
So even if you wanted to take the fall, it's too late.
Looks like you'll have to trust me.
You actually think that's possible, don't you?
You are a naive bitch.
And why is that?
Because they're based on lies.
There's no trust.
I promise you, it'll end badly.
You're late.
She's been cleared of all the murder charges.
How?
Well, Tyler confessed before she died.
Your mother seems to believe that you and I shouldn't trust each other.
She know something I don't?
You boys are running out of time.
Bail hearing's set for tomorrow morning.
Clay's sitting down with Otto right now.
Hook him up with Lenny the Pimp and we'll get some info.
The meeting's been arranged.
Good.
You owe me something now, don't you?
We know O'Dooley, Brogan and Roarke.
I never saw any of the others.
Put it in the document along with my statement about Jimmy, and I'll sign off on all of them.
Good, good.
Keep me plugged into Jimmy.
Absolutely.
Better than you.
Yeah, that's a pretty solid majority these days.
No shit.
Listen, the, uh... the club needs a big favor.
Need you to reach out to your Eastern Block friends.
Why do we want Jimmy?
He killed five members in Northern Ireland.
We, uh, we need the location of the safe house.
Buy him out?
That's the only way to get Jimmy.
All right, why don't you, uh... why don't you find out what that would look like?
We gotta know fast, though.
I'll pass on what I know through the attorneys.
Nothing impulsive, right?
Losing Abel, all the death.
Every decision you make has to be made in the light of these extreme circumstances.
What are you saying?
It's a different time.
We can't look at Jax in the same light as John.
You do know I charge hourly, right?
Just send it.
Jax, can I show you something real important?
Where's Abel?
Lyla and Neeta are with him at home.
Your mother's in jail.
Please, you can tell me.
Jax, look!
What's this?
After Tara got kidnapped, I tried to tell you guys about this.
Well, I didn't!
He's got three boxes full.
20s, 50s, hundreds.
It's gonna take a couple hours.
Every one of these bills is irregular.
Any scrutiny, the Russians are gonna know.
Maybe we need to create some sort of distraction.
Putlova's too smart.
I don't see how this is going down without it turning bloody.
Hey, I got 40 bucks in my wallet.
I got an idea.
I need money.
I still have access to the 250K that we used for Tara's ransom.
That should do it.
What happens when the club asks you where you got it?
We're gonna be there at the exchange.
It's the only way you get the cash.
We'll put Jimmy in the van.
You send in your team, pretend you're after the Russians.
Fair enough.
I'll set it up.
Is Donny back yet?
I don't think so.
You ready?
You sure we can't spare one of the prospects?
We don't know what Putlova's going to show up with.
We need bodies... at least till we make the exchange.
You sure about this?
I'm the only one who can do it.
Admit it... you need me.
I guess I do.
I want you to wear this.
Fancy.
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
To us.
Yeah.
Promise you told me everything?
You'll know everything soon enough, babe.
You guys, uh, headed out?
What gave it away?
Will do.
What you did for us it won't be forgotten.
No Donny?
Don't make sense.
Maybe he changed his mind.
Didn't Luke just up and leave you, too?
Luke didn't leave.
He got taken out.
Where we going?
We need to pick something up.
What the hell is this?
After all I done for you.
The money, the guns.
Don't do this.
Thank you.
Take care, gentlemen.
Let's go.
Tara...
Almost home, Jimmy.
Looks like Viktor did a little accounting.
Here they come.
Just keeping us both honest.
You get Jimmy and my statement when my club gets free of hard time.
My recommendation that the federal automatic weapons charges be reduced from 15 to three years, parole in 14 months.
And for that... you give me this.
Your statement of cooperation.
You share your full knowledge of the gun-running operation and any illegal activities perpetrated by the Irish Council and Jimmy O'Phelan.
All it needs is your signature.
I sign this, what's to stop you getting the IRA, letting us rot in prison for 15 years?
What's to stop you from delivering this to your lawyer and killing Jimmy?
I'm officially a rat.
Your turn.
Where is Jimmy?
There is no play here.
Follow me.
Are we okay?
How'd you know he was here?
What's this idiot doing?
It's Unser.
Should I pull over?
He might know something.
What the hell is this, Wayne?
What?
I got an anonymous tip.
Probably bullshit, but they said that four or five of Jimmy's guys are going to be waiting for you up at the Newton turnout.
That's only a few miles south.
I can call the Sanwa sheriffs and have them check it out.
Wait, I don't want to leave you alone.
Just to be safe.
Really?
I'm a stage-three cancer, sweetheart.
I ain't got that many perks left.
No, thanks.
You should really have some.
You got to be shitting me.
Take care of our girls, Phillip, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
This is insanity, Opie.
You have any idea what kind of heat this is going to bring the club, huh?
Put your hands on the wheel.
Please don't do this!
Hey, let's go.
Left, left side.
I had bridge work done on the right.
Let's go, kids.
They need to see you.
Jax wanted you to read this, then burn it.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Is Tara here?
No.
I made you an accessory.
It was a club vote.
I'd never turn on my club or my family.
I'm not my father.
Every day it becomes more clear that I don't belong here.
Gemma hates my apathy.
She hates all of me.
Her chill is terrifying.
I know my days are numbered, Mo, and when these letters stop, you can be certain that my death will come at the hands of my wife my wife and best friend.
At least my sweet Thomas will never suffer my life.
And as usual, arguing since 6:00.
Cate... meet Lux, our daughter.
You never even told me I've got a kid out there!
I am not granting you emancipation.
It is 7:00 a.m., and you are listening to Morning Madness with Cate and Ryan.
It's the morning after Cate's big announcement.
For those of you who missed it, a quick recap may be in order.
Thanks, Ryan.
Later.
It's parenting, okay?
I mean, how hard is it gonna be?
Every dummy out there is doing it.
It is Crazy Abby, everyone.
Your kid jus t-just reappears out of nowhere.
Have you told Mom yet?
Actually, you want to make that joint custody.
With Dewey Johnson?
No, our school mascot, AKA the dad.
Cate, I loved Nate Bazile!
God, no matter... no matter how many times I say that, it never gets less terrifying.
Do you have any idea where Lux is right now?
Okay, um, just... will you cover for me?
We need to get you a cell phone.
I guess this time there was just more blood.
Oh, Abby's sister.
Or that.
Yeah, um, I'm actually here to enroll a new student to start tomorrow...
I didn't get your name.
You got a name?
Tell your mother, Nate, about the girl you got pregnant in high school.
Okay, you got to understand, I was gonna tell you...
You have a daughter?
Well, you know, the-the normal way.
And, uh... you just found out about this?
Lux-- she just showed up at my doorstep last week.
We'll have dinner tomorrow night.
I never asked you to bail me out.
You're not asking me to pay your rent, either, but I'm doing it.
I promise you, I am just looking out for your best interests.
It's the only time I get to see her, now that she's at Sunnyvale and I'm across town.
My classroom's right past that.
Brynn, just relax.
Hey, Mr. Rogers still in guidance?
Wait.
I'm gonna go grab my schedule.
Oh, your dad would go on about that play.
Besides hearing you have a kid on the radio?
Just show him you're trying to be a good dad.
You mean Jones's?
So, you're friends with Jones?
Not, like, with benefits or anything.
You weren't there.
Anyway, so, I've been at boarding school in California.
I got kicked out for doing it with my boyfriend on the lab table.
Wait, seriously?
I'm going outside.
Hey, I see you.
What are you doing here?
I'm signing up for cheerleading.
Well, I was trying, but I was too busy getting reamed out from my father.
Turns out he heard what your dumb fiancÃ© said on the radio.
Oh, well, my dumb fiancÃ© and I are having dinner with Lux.
You let some random guy suffocate you with his mouth?
He's not some random guy.
No offense, pal.
Nobody needs to be concerned.
Okay, he just came to pick me up.
We're going to go hang out, grab some dinner.
I'll have her home by 10:00.
I am making dinner tonight for your first day at Westmonte.
Okay, so Bug following us back here-- that's not what I had in mind.
Cate just telling you what to do and you doing it?
'Cause why?
You've been on your own your whole life.
Natasha and Mexico.
Okay, fine, so it doesn't have to be Mexico.
L.A., Vegas, Seattle.
We go somewhere where no one'll find you guys till you're 18.
Where's the three grand you saved, the money to get emancipated?
My life savings?
Well, I have it, but... it's not enough for the four of us to live on.
Seriously, all we need is the cash to get there.
No, that's from Baze.
That actually, like, means something to me.
Okay, so something else.
Let's just do what it takes so we can be together, okay?
Or... we can just be together now.
No, but I know their type.
You see?
It's a sign.
Does "no means no" mean anything to you?
Look, Cate, my dad is pissed, and if I don't show up tonight, he is going to take back the bar.
I didn't make rent, he found out about Lux-- hey, thanks for that-- and he thinks that we can't handle a kid.
We?
We're going to Baze's, after all!
So, is this being a good parent?
What, ripping you out of the clutches of some tattooed freak?
Okay, the point is to make a good impression, and... bringing Bug, it would have just been an... an impression.
Oh, you're gorgeous.
Oh, my God, just look at you.
Um, Mom, this is Cate.
Oh, sorry, Costco was a zoo, but we got the wine!
Oh, my God.
My family.
Come on, I want to show you around, sweetie.
Okay, okay, so, um, what are you two doing here?
Oh, um, Annie, right?
No, it's Abby.
All these years I thought you lost your virginity to that giant wasp.
For heaven's sakes, give me a little credit.
Because he doesn't even know who you are.
Uh, he was being discreet.
And actually, Lux, uh, grew up listening to Cate on the radio.
Right, um...
Lux, why don't you tell everyone how you grew up listening?
I grew up listening.
So, Baze, you own a bar?
He doesn't own anything.
You know, I haven't had the chance to tell you this yet, but, uh, Lux is going to Westmonte.
We're gonna go have a little family pow-wow, 'cause, you know, like, families, it's what we do.
But you don't.
I'm not you, okay?
I don't want what you want.
You're not.
So, we-we've come together as your families to intervene.
What?
Intervene with what?
I think what Abby is trying to say is that we have some concerns.
The two of you are, you're not ready to be parents.
But the way to rectify it isn't to dig in deeper.
This is a kid's life we're talking about.
Would anyone like anything?
Water?
We're just wondering if you've explored all of your options.
Y-You're out at events every night.
Plenty of people do it.
I don't think anyone's suggesting that.
Actually, I was.
And your parental skills are so stellar?
Have you met your son?
It's abundantly clear that Ellen and I are the only people in this room qualified to parent anyone.
You two are whack jobs.
Okay, I knew she was pregnant, and I knew it was mine.
But somehow I have managed to do that every day since.
It's because you threatened to take away the one means I have of actually supporting my kid.
Because that's what I'm trying to do here, Dad-- whether you believe it or no t- is support my kid.
Because that's what I thought parents did.
I supported you every day of your life.
It's because I don't wanna turn my back on Lux the way that you...
The way, what, huh?
Come on, say it, Nate.
Like I did to you?
Wait, where's Lux?
And kind of mine.
But it just seems like the more I try, the worse it's getting.
I don't know.
Pretty insightful, for a quarterback.
Thanks.
Me, too.
All right, you should go before Cate gets home.
Jones is gonna love it.
How much?
Well, 200's all I got.
Two hundred?
Yeah, that's perfect.
Cool.
What's this?
It's what's most important, right?
I do want my son to be happy.
What are you doing here?
I'm just looking around.
Well... not this month, at least.
I don't know how you came up with the rent money that fast.
You hit Cate up?
I mean, of... of course I do.
So, the bar-- hang on to it.
So, I got a parenting book.
And I'm sorry for not accepting yours.
Where are we?
On the top of Bug's apartment.
This is where I was going to live.
That's what you said parents are supposed to do, right?
Come on.
Surgeons are detail-oriented.
Karev, you still need a lift to--oh, my-- oh, my god!
My heart does not live in my... vagina.
Gary from legal.
Dr. Hunt and I-- ooh, don't, 'cause then you're just lying, and that's no good
Dude, run away before I find a brick.
So... my patient, been treated...
But screwing drug reps is not gonna make you feel better.
Yeah, it is.
I had to drop this off.
I'm sorry you have to do this.
Well, this drug testing, it's part of the rehab program.
You're not getting on a plane.
So why don't you take your hands off me?
Dr. Harper avery.
You're harper avery's grandson?
Did you know that pretty boy's grandfather was god?
Oh, whatever, ellis grey's daughter.
I'm just telling them what happened!
She stole my car... again.
So she'll be off her feet for a few weeks.
So more waiting on her hand and foot?
Brilliant.
I saw that, kathy!
You brought me a neurosurgeon for some abdominal cramps?
I-I didn't know.
Uh, my condolences.
Who else then?
Dr. Bailey can do the surgery right away.
Oh, the research line.
Dr. Bailey is more than capable of performing the surgery--
It is gonna be very difficult to find you a new set of lungs.
Elliot survived leukemia and lymphoma.
I do not care.
Ah, here we go.
He's giving them the speech.
What speech?
About the wonders of medicine.
Well, that's 'cause you haven't heard the speech yet.
We can do it.
That's the way a chief does things.
Shepherd, take note.
It's on you, then.
What was that?
I said no.
Okay, I-I-I am not hungry at all.
So just go eat alone.
Hey, down in front, bigfoot.
Oh, it's bigfoot now.
Well, you know what they say about guys with big feet.
He didn't die.
What's going on?
You're like some miracle worker or something.
What the hell is going on?
Dr. Sloan, come and tell her yourself.
I have some very good news for you!
Okay, shouldn't we put him out?
I've got it.
Yep, he's fine.
Um, you hear about harper- I heard about your motorcycle--oh.
We'll wait until you get the lungs that you deserve.
No matter what happens, my affairs are in order.
It's your only shot.
Dr. Sloan, good timing.
Dr. Karev and I are pretty much done.
It's him. 9-1-1.
It's an incredible opportunity.
I don't want your help.
I don't--I can't l-leave-- leave--
Fine, but you're not putting me out.
Look, it could've been my mistake in there, derek.
I get it.
You got used to being the one person she could count on.
Except, no, I am not gonna miss taking care of her.
I wasted years of my life and I was miserable.
But I let you, because I was taking care of you.
I'm moving out, mom.
I heard that.
Oh, sorry.
All right, yang, get in there and help me.
Clamp.
What?
You want to go not have feelings somewhere?
I'm--I'm a little scared.
We never know how our day is going to end up.
How's your regenerative medicine research going?
Start with your name, and we'll go from there.
I had to pee in a cup today, derek.
I had to pee in a cup, and... it was humiliating.
Tomorrow's another day.
Besides, it's fun.
What can I say?
My heart lives in my scalpel.
Going over your plans... it's gonna feel great when you connect.
It's just you, the bat and the ball.
Yeah, I'm a badass chick, cristina.
Oh, Lois, I'm so glad you were able to make it to dinner tonight.
Oh, me, too, Mom.
Did you find the new bathroom okay?
He's probably down at the dock tinkering with that darn yacht of his.
Hey, Babs, settle something for us.
I wanted to bring, um, an owl on this trip, but Lois wouldn't let me.
Hey, can we change the channel?
I'm tired of watching Old Ships.
Peter, that's not a TV, it's a painting.
Actually, Lois, it is a TV.
It's the PBS show Old Ships.
Good, I hate PBS.
I don't know, maybe, maybe you had to see the first three to get this, but I-I am completely lost.
Only if it has a mirror at the end of it, and it says, "How about you?"
Oh, wow, look at these old photos of you and Dad.
This must be around the time you guys were first dating, huh?
Oh dear, yes.
Ah, your father was so handsome back then.
I remember the day we met.
It was one of those lovely, warm summer days by the shore.
Perfect giant beach ball weather.
Terrible, sir.
Good, good.
My friend and I held our breath, wondering which one of us he was talking to.
But the lucky one was me.
And from there, our romance blossomed.
I love you, Pussycup.
I love you, too.
Now, let's kiss while the camera pans over to the drapes.
Good stuff happening over here.
All implied.
It was the happiest time of our lives.
Unfortunately, that was the year the great war with Alaska broke out, and even Carter's lofty connections couldn't save him from the draft.
Babs, you want to spend a mind-blowing afternoon?
Get stoned and listen to this song.
So I took up with a young dandy named Rodginald.
He would bring me small chocolates and sit in my front parlor and pitch woo at me, taking my hand gently and singing from bended knee the popular songs of his youth.
I believe Rodginald knew this, and he even tried to strike me in the manner to which I had become accustomed.
And then a miracle happened.
Oh, Carter, you're alive!
I've missed you so.
Babs, be my wife!
Oh, yes, Carter, yes!
Hey, that's my gal!
Dear, sir, I respectfully urge you to prepare yourself for one devil of a skirmish!
Oh, I always love hearing that story, Mom.
I got a story about a fat guy who's starving and bored.
Look, Peter, if you're that hungry, go down to the dock and find Daddy, and we'll get dinner started.
You're not gonna get dinner started.
She's gonna tell that sloppy old Spanish maid to do it.
And she will, but only because she needs money to pay for medicine for her prematurely overweight son Diabeto.
Mama, may I have cookie?
No, Diabeto, roll back to kitchen.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, dinner's ready!
Damn it, he can't hear me.
Ah, that was excellent.
When I clenched it, you took your fingers away.
You were right to do that.
Just turn the Ms upside down and send them down here!
You can't just do that!
That's not your concern.
You didn't see anything.
Remember that or I'll ruin you.
Okay, okay, I promise.
I'll be as quiet as a church mouse.
Hey, Billy, I was gonna have a party at the rectory this evening.
Do you like sacramental wine and mouse Russell Crowe movies?
Oh, boy, do I!
Now, remember, you keep your mouth shut about what you saw.
Yes, sir, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Oh, there you are, boys.
Go on, put some food in your mouth.
Peter, are you feeling all right?
Oh, he's fine.
You know how hungry a man gets after a day at sea.
You should've seen him when we had dinner with Paul McCartney's ex-wife.
He kept playing footsie with her under the table.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
Anyway, he told me not to tell anybody, but I'm having a real hard time not telling Lois.
How could you not?
Yeah, I know, but I don't know what to do.
It's really hard keeping my mouth shut.
Actually, you know something, Peter, this, this could be an opportunity for you.
Y-You could probably get him to pay through the nose to keep your mouth shut.
Yeah, you could really milk this thing, Peter.
Yeah, Brian, no one cares what you think.
I'll go have a look.
Is that how you say that?
I've only seen that word written.
That's not a toilet!
Hey, when's it go down, by the way?
It's just doing a lot of loop-de-loops.
Get the hell out of there, you son of a bitch!
Not unless you want me to blab about what happened on the yacht.
What are you getting at, Griffin?
That's right, you're gonna start doing a lot of stuff for me.
Like what?
Well, for starters, you got more than one limo?
What the hell is that?
All right, you ready?
I don't want to do this.
That went exactly as I wanted it to go.
All right here's your Mike and Ikes with all the Ikes taken out.
I hope you were careful, 'cause I swear to God, if I find one Ike in there, I'm going straight to Babs.
People of France, a good-looking, depressed guy smoking a cigarette is not a movie, and your sirens sound like gay guys having a threesome.
All right, you got my catch phrases for me?
I just want you to know this was a huge pain in the ass.
Also, I've been under the weather lately, so it may not be my best work.
Really?
Oh, I love it.
Oh, man, there are a lot of good ones here.
Did you get down to the one at the bottom there?
Which one?
"On your mark, get set, terrible." No, this one here.
Take it up with my butt, 'cause he's the only one who gives a crap.
Wow, what a great sentence.
You know, Lois, I've noticed Peter and Carter spending a lot of time together lately.
It's nice to see them finally getting on.
Boy, I can't wait to get this home.
You know, I keep not laughing at The Big Bang Theory, and I figure it's got to be the television, you know?
TV this size-- forget it, it'll have me laughing till I got snots falling out of my nose.
Carter, where are you taking our television?
Because Peter is the best and he is awesome and he makes better laser sounds than I do.
Well, on your mark, get set, terrible.
No, no, but I-I understand that this is bad.
You stupid fat bastard!
Well, I don't blame her.
You know, maybe the two of you splitting up is a blessing in disguise.
I mean, there are obviously some problems in your relationship.
Who knows, maybe some time apart could be just what you need.
It's easy.
I'll help you meet some women, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Come on, it's been 50 years since I've been on a date.
Well, how'd you get that chick on the boat, then?
Yeah, they don't have those anymore.
Here, I got these off a Web site that tells you good things to say when hot women walk by.
Ooh, here comes a hot one.
Say the first thing on the list.
Hey, why don't you and your friend come join us over at our table.
We would-- we would love to.
Hey, boy, boy, fetch me a John Barrymore and soda and three Myrna Loys for the women.
Excuse me?
Does he belong to somebody else?
Come on, girls, let's ditch this racist dick.
Now we got to go to another club and start all over again.
Peter, I don't want to go to another club.
Babs?
You got a room full of chicks like that and you're thinking about Babs?
She looks like someone farted in a shoe.
I had a moment of weakness, but I-I know now that I was wrong.
You-you got to help me get her back.
Well, it's probably the right move anyway.
Those girls seemed kind of annoying.
Look at them over there taking a group picture together.
And that's where fat girls come from.
Forget about yourself for a second, Carter.
Look what has happened to Jonathan Lipnicki.
Now as soon as she sees you, you've got to do exactly what I...
Hey, whose Duesenberg is that parked in the driveway?
There's only one man I know who drives a Duesenberg.
Oh, I am too, Rodginald.
Do you think perhaps one day, if we should marry, that I could sit beside you?
Yes, I think that would be fine.
Get away from my wife, you rascal!
Oh, such language in the presence of a lady.
If it's a row you want, I will cleave you in twixt!
Hang-hang on, Carter, I think I know how to take this guy down.
Penis.
Carter, get out of here this instant!
I don't ever want to see you again.
Pussycup, please.
Mrs. Pewterschmidt, Carter has something important to say to you.
I'll set the mood.
Babs, I need you.
Cheating on you was the worst mistake of my life.
I kneel before you a frightened soul and a broken man.
A man who has nothing without you.
Give me one more chance, and I pledge to place above you nothing-- not even myself-- for all my time here, and for time forever.
Please, I beg you.
Carter, what you did was unforgivable.
I know I can't do it overnight, but we can still have a lot of years together.
Please, just let me try.
Carter, you had sex with that woman.
So, no, I can't trust you.
But at my age, I'm certainly not going to remarry either.
Come here, you.
Okay, maybe next week.
I know.
Day 213-- found nothing.
Well, three months ago we found an onyx bead.
No offense, Dr. Brennan, but what we're looking for is evidence of early man, not jewelry that's barely 2,000 years old.
I find it interesting that I am only afraid of snakes when Booth is around to be jumped upon.
She says two insurgents, five minutes ago, went to kidnap child of NATO interpreter.
We going to allow that?
Just like we trained, boys, a hundred times.
You think you're here to talk about brain damage in veterans.
That's because I'm here to talk about brain damage in veterans.
All she's going to want to talk about is that missing child.
I have nothing to say about Logan Bartlett.
That's the problem.
I have been up all night going over forensic anthropology and entomology reports.
I can't confirm the identity of the child in my morgue.
Which is the excuse the Justice Department will use to fire you.
I'm good at my job, Caroline.
They're not going to fire me.
What they want is for you to shut up about brain damage in veterans.
If I can't fix this carburetor, we're in trouble.
I think we might be in trouble anyway.
Those young men are Alifuru.
An Alifuru man's worth is measured by how many daughters he has, not sons, which indicates that they venerate women.
What if these are evil, rapist Alifuru?
Well, in that case, when they get close enough, you take the little one and I'll get the other two.
Why are you in your underwear?
You said look like a woman.
Should I take off more?
Stay back, stay back.
Put the boy down.
Don't pretend you don't understand what I'm talking about.
You put the boy down or I'll shoot you now.
Thank you, thank you.
This would not have happened if his father was here, where he is supposed to be, instead of off fighting someone else's war.
You need to come home right away.
Cam's going to lose her job and her reputation if you don't do your white knight routine.
Now, saddle up, Sir Galahad, get yourself back here, and convince the powers that be.
Today I have with me in the studio Dr. Camille Saroyan, the federal medical examiner for D.C. and the environs.
Dr. Saroyan has an exemplary record, winning several citations along the way.
It's an honor to meet you, Dr. Saroyan.
Try to start the truck, Daisy.
There could be more.
With all that success behind you, why are you stalled on the Logan Bartlett case?
That is true-- I am the smartest.
In the last eight months, I've performed autopsies on six veterans-- four fought in Iraq, two in Afghanistan.
All six show signs of brain damage consistent with improvised explosive devices.
Dr. Saroyan, why haven't you identified the remains of the child currently on your slab?
My slab?
Oh, that's not ethical!
They've started a search for a new federal medical examiner.
Caroline, I'm very good at my job.
Yes, you are very good, but that's not the issue.
You said your entomologist and anthropologist are no good, right?
The best anthropologist is in Indonesia, the best cop is in Afghanistan, and the best entomologist is in France.
I got 'em all coming back.
How'd you do that?
Same way I'm going to get you a tame psychologist.
Talk to me.
That is no way for an adult holding a PhD in psychology to answer the telephone.
Booth's on his way back from Afghanistan and I hear he has major post- traumatic stress syndrome.
Enough said.
I'll get myself reactivated immediately.
So was it dangerous in Afghanistan?
Because you seem really very heavily armed in this photograph.
How about you?
Any headhunters or cannibals?
You weren't there to save me.
So did you meet anyone special?
How about you?
How-how did you meet?
Oh, I arrested her for being in a restricted area.
Is it serious between you?
Serious as a heart attack.
So, I-I find that I am looking forward to seeing everyone.
Great.
The reason we're here...
Cam here has decided to launch a jihad.
Far, far above us on the food chain, someone with a cold heart has decided that Cam must be silenced.
Brain damage in veterans.
Three months ago, a two-year-old boy, Logan Bartlett, disappears.
Kidnapped child, the media jumped on it big time, blew it up huge.
You believe this is Logan Bartlett?
The media does and they're saying I'm incompetent because I won't confirm or deny.
Incompetence is grounds for dismissal.
Well, the size is right for a two-year-old.
The sternum is crushed.
That's a possible cause of death.
The bug guy says insect activity indicates that the time of death was between six and 12 weeks ago.
In fact, nobody is any of you.
That didn't make sense.
So our goal here is you people tuck in like the old days, make Cam look competent so we keep us the best federal coroner we ever had.
I had no idea you thought that.
I'm in, but first thing in the morning, I gotta have breakfast with Parker, and then I'll go find the missing kid's parents, and see if I get any information off them, all right?
See you in the lab tomorrow.
Thank you, guys.
Daisy said that she needs some time off.
Who else is available?
Nobody.
Mr. Vaziri switched majors from forensic to cultural anthropology.
He's interning at the Baghdad Museum.
Fisher checked into a clinic with a case of The Hopeless Vapors.
Dr. Edison took a position in Chicago.
What about Wendell?
Last I heard, working in a repair shop.
Excuse me.
You're no longer in the Jeffersonian, all my interns gone.
What happened is you put your own desires ahead of everything else and you left.
Are you angry with me?
Yes, I am angry, Dr. Brennan.
Did you kill anybody?
Someday, me and you are gonna talk all about it, all right?
Are you going away again?
No, never.
Because of me?
Drink your orange juice.
Wendell Bray?
Did you find Homo floresiensis in Maluku?
No, not yet.
I gotta pay rent, save up for tuition.
I-I put Logan down at 8:00 p.m., after his bath.
Don't do that.
Look, I've been sober for over a year.
So, when did you notice that Logan was gone?
He's usually up around 6:00.
So that's when I went in, and he was just, he was gone.
The Missing Persons cops, they got it all.
Trevor's angry, Agent Booth, but he would never do anything to harm Logan.
Thank you for that, Carrie.
Look, I'm a father.
I can only imagine what you're going through right now.
What about me?
It's not very clear right now.
But if I were you, I'd take that as a good reason to have hope, right?
Oh, wow, these really are the remains of a child, huh?
It's a male child.
You like living in Paris?
Are you kidding?
It's Paris.
Yeah, I get to draw the Eiffel Tower... not dead children's faces.
These remains were found wrapped in a blanket in a shallow grave along the Potomac?
Um... it looks like it might have been cut from something larger.
The stitching suggests that maybe it's from some kind of garment, like a jacket or a sleeping bag.
What does this look like to you, Wendell?
Root completion of the canines.
That, plus the fusion of the vertebral elements.
You're suggesting that this victim is over three years old?
Despite his small size?
It's hard to be sure in a child this young, but the eye orbits are relatively round.
Yes, Angela is right.
About what?
The round eye orbits.
The skull is brachycephalic...
So it can't be Logan Bartlett.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Do me a favor, huh?
Quit wasting your time appreciating my cooperation, go find my kid.
Nice man.
You think he killed his son?
I don't quite get killer off of him.
Oh-ho, what's going on here?
Because I told Agent Corby that you needed your office back.
You almost die or something?
I should know better than to ask.
Anything else happen to you over there that you'd maybe like to talk about?
Does Dr. Brennan know?
Of course she does.
Which means there's absolutely no reason for the two of you not to work together, get the old team back together, catch miscreants and killers and the like.
I'm staying, but I'm pretty sure Bones is heading back to the Moppapachuey Islands, or whatever they're called, to find her missing link to humanity.
You wouldn't believe what I went through to hang onto that.
I never asked you to give me the ring back.
When I left, you and I weren't really precise on where we were as a couple.
You flushed me, Daisy.
I mean, how much more clearer could it be?
Just to be clear, in your mind, we're no longer engaged?
What?
No!
Okay, this is very confusing for me because I spent the last few months trying to forget about you.
You found someone else while I was away?
Well, as a matter of fact, yeah, I met a few women, and by "a few" I mean more than two.
I was completely faithful, but I don't blame you for seeking comfort in the arms of others.
Blame me?
You looked me in the eye and told me that your career would always come first.
I was led astray by my brain.
Well, I need some time to think.
Then you keep the ring.
You want us to be engaged, you just give it back.
Yes, I'm seeing Harris' lines here in the tibia.
These lines of calcified material in the shinbone?
Signifies childhood malnutrition.
Well, anyone could learn the labels, Mr. Bray, but not everyone would notice the condition.
Nice.
What have you got?
Well, we won't know for certain until we get a complete histological profile, but it's looking pretty good that this kid is an Asian immigrant.
And where's my office?
You see that table over there?
That's your office.
It's not Logan Bartlett.
Cam's bug guy-- really not top shelf, by the way-- says that insect activity indicates that this kid died between six and 12 weeks ago, but he didn't take into account the fact that the kid was wrapped up.
The blanket retarded insect activity.
Again... not a blanket.
Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae flies are present as adults and early instar larva...
You're not interested in details.
Well, maybe not the famous one, but this is somebody's missing child.
So you are positively, absatively certain that it isn't Logan Bartlett?
"Absatively"-- that's not a word.
Yes, we are certain.
So you people come back from the far-flung corners of the Earth, out past the outer suburbs of Timbuktu, and you solve the case in a shake?
What's a shake?
Three jiffies and a cha-cha.
We didn't actually solve the case.
All we've done is ascertain that the remains are not those of Logan Bartlett.
We still have to figure out whose remains are in Cam's lab and what happened to him.
You are so right, Dr. Brennan.
How could I have taken my eye off the ball like that?
Blood flow is crucial to cognitive dexterity.
Perhaps you don't get enough exercise.
We figure this out, Cam has a chance to keep her job, right?
Absatively.
Look, nothing against Carrie, but you've got to admit it was crazy to choose the alcoholic mother over the father.
It was just a bad decision, something was bound to happen.
Well, this guys looks you in the eye-- his expressions reach his entire face, not just his mouth-- he's speaking in contractions instead of formally.
Look, see.
He expands himself outwardly in his communication.
Forget about this guy, okay?
This is a missing persons case right now.
It's out of my hands.
What's important right now is we're working on a homicide.
What do we have on that?
Sex crime.
Hard not to go there.
Thanks.
Hey, uh, Booth, can I ask you a personal question?
Oh, that depends-- about you or me?
Me.
Shoot.
If you don't mind me asking, Dr. B, why do you keeps staring at the X ray?
Because I'm suffering the nagging certainty that my eyes are seeing something which my brain refuses to process.
Isn't your brain supposed to be the smart one?
Hey, Ange, you want something to eat?
I do, yes, but I want it in Paris.
Are her eyeballs and brainpan arguing again?
I've got it.
There's nearly imperceptible damage to the hyoid.
The little boy got strangled.
Well, it's not cracked or crushed.
It's more like there's a hole or a puncture.
I'll check it out on the actual bone.
So, um, what is the deal with Booth?
Is it weird seeing him again?
Are you in love with Booth?
A little bit, but that's not what I mean.
Don't tell me that you're happy about him finding somebody else?
I'm very pleased for him.
Did you think about Booth at all when you were away?
Yes, I did.
A few times I actually dreamed about him.
What does that mean?
It means you're going to die loveless and alone.
I don't follow your reasoning.
Sweetie, can you ask me how I am, please?
Well, I already know how you are.
You love living in Paris, and you don't miss murderers and violence.
What I did miss is my period.
I hope you're hugging me because you're excited about being an aunt.
Yes, you better be because I haven't even told Hodges yet.
Anthropologically speaking, women often confide in other women before broaching sensitive subjects with their mates.
Dr. Brennan was right.
I found a very small puncture in the boy's hyoid.
A puncture?
Wood.
My best estimate is hardwood.
Maple, alder or ash.
I don't believe a stabbing would cause this kind of damage.
How else would a sharp piece of wood come into contact with the hyoid?
The damage to the sternum was from the Heimlich maneuver?
What about him being tied up like this?
Yeah, that mostly looks bad.
Angie says the boy was Asian.
So we're not looking at a murder?
We're looking at negligence or maybe even an accident?
Logically, I'd say yes.
Korea.
Korea?
Mostly in outerwear.
That would explain the malnutrition.
North Korea is not famous for its cuisine.
North Koreans aren't allowed to leave their country.
So we're looking for an industrial sewing operation with a Korean connection.
Going to check out a possible crime scene.
You refusing to wear your seat belt.
That's right.
Like a jungle cat.
No, you should say like a flea when referring to lightning fast reflexes.
Listen, Bones, we got to talk about this.
You did?
It's an anthropological fact that in any community of individuals, there is a linchpin or keystone personality.
Uh, the leader, you mean?
Not usually.
Yes, I am obviously the linchpin personality in our group.
But I left, too.
All right, the question is, are you back?
That's a long list of very difficult tasks.
Well, it's not easy being the linchpin, now is it?
Well, that's true.
Did you make a decision about the ring?
I don't like snakes.
Or being away from... people.
Well, we're not engaged.
Would you like to still be friends?
So I guess this is good-bye then.
Well, you'll always be my Lancelot.
It is to me.
Bye, Daisy.
Bye, Lance.
My parents immigrated from South Korea at the end of the Korean War, but I'm an American citizen.
Do you employ anyone from North Korea?
Yes, an old friend of my father's and his granddaughter escaped to South Korea, so we sponsored them.
We cleared out a small apartment for them.
Does she have a child, um, around three years old?
Yes, she did, but she decided to send him back to his father in South Korea.
And both of them are really screwed up about it.
You know why I'm here.
I not speak very good English.
Oh, you're doing a really, really good job.
Uh, pleased to meet you, sir.
You understand, though, why I'm here?
Mr. Park says that you have, uh, a child.
Look, we know what happened.
Myung Dae choked on a wooden screw.
You wrapped him up in a blanket that you made from your jacket, and you buried him with as much love as you could.
They were so afraid of the authorities that they buried the child themselves?
Ah, you know, knowing Caroline, she probably won't even charge them.
She got everybody back here to save my job.
Why do we only solve crimes when we have a dead body?
Seriously?
Because I'm a pathologist and she's a forensic anthropologist.
Fresh dead, long-time dead.
I was thinking about Logan Bartlett.
What kind of father does that?
Hey, Mrs. Bartlett, you know that this is a long shot, right?
You told me to have hope.
This is me hoping.
If it's such a long shot, then why did we bring her?
This is the only park near where Trevor's brother lives.
Logan loved it.
Well, just don't get your hopes up too much, all right?
Oh, I believe she should get her hopes up.
Bones, why?
Mrs. Bartlett, please stay in the car.
That's Logan.
Trevor dyed his hair, but that's Logan.
He kidnapped him to hurt his wife.
I find I would like to strike him.
Well, let's hope he runs, all right, and I'll take him down like a flea.
Baby.
I think it would be good if we had the baby here in the States.
It still sounds so weird.
Yeah, all that wine in France is now totally wasted on me.
chuckles) Tea, please.
Why did you suddenly get quiet?
Oh, because I am so happy.
Okay, so you don't mind, then?
Are you kidding?
This is the greatest news I have ever gotten.
Mind?
You're not doing this for me?
You mean the way you went to Paris for me?
The baby.
We're going to have a baby.
I'm going to be a dad.
You know what else I've been realizing, too, is that we are actually the glue that holds the whole clattery operation together.
A baby.
I'm going to be a daddy.
If you cry, then I'm going to start crying, and then...
The whole Scooby gang's coming back.
That's how it should be.
You got something magic, you don't scatter it to the ends of the Earth, you concentrate it in one place.
There isn't a single normal law enforcement officer who could work with these people.
What are you staring at?
It's you.
What's me?
You're the linchpin.
You managed to get us all back here, and then you fixed it so we'd stay.
I have no idea what you're talking about, Dr. Brennan.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I find I'd like to hug you.
Cam's back at the Jeffersonian.
Uh, why are you staring at Bones like that?
Well, I think we should thank Dr. Brennan for insisting that the Jeffersonian re-form a forensic unit on the premises.
And we should recognize that Booth's return to duty at the FBI means that we can work with them again.
So, how come I'm not the linchpin here?
I'm the linchpin.
Making beautiful music for shoppers.
Totally not my problem.
Oh, can Sweets and I come?
Right.
I won't sit next to you, I promise.
Did you see how happy Hodgins was to be back at work?
I am definitely doing the right thing.
It's a lot to work around.
Well, we've worked around bigger.
Metaphorically speaking.
Metaphorically.
Welcome home, Bones.
I told you hiking was crazy.
We should have just bought plaid shirts and gone to a resort.
We'll hit the trail as long as we keep heading west, and we're heading west!
You don't know that, Michael.
Tracey, that's the sun, so that's South and that's west!
Great.
Look, if you don't like it, then stay out here.
Well, don't leave me all alone!
Oh, we are so totally gonna die.
You bastard.
We are not gonna die!
Says you.
Oh, my God.
We're totally gonna die!
I find it anomalous that you would leave her since you believe so emphatically in the mythic powers of love.
Do you understand what she's saying?
Served with my brother in '04.
I'm a... well, I was a Ranger.
Sorry, I didn't mean to bring us down.
This one is a male, late 20s, early 30s.
Yeah, what happened there, Bones?
Well, multiple fractures, more severe on the female.
It would appear that way.
Some of the bone of the skull as well.
Yeah, that'll happen pretty fast out here.
Well, it makes determining time of death more difficult.
It seems like we were never away from each other, doesn't it?
Well, I needed some time to rationally assess the best use of my considerable skills.
So... do you miss her?
Yeah, of course I do.
Well, if there's anything that I can do...
You know, I didn't leave Hannah.
I-I'm sorry I brought it up.
I put in a request to be assigned to the Washington press corps.
Something you said you'd never do.
Well, that was before I realized how much I hated waking up alone.
Hello.
Hannah Burley.
That shows excellent judgment.
Most of the fractures on the female are localized to the left posterior side.
Yeah, there are multiple breaks in the femur, pelvis, vertebrae...
So, what was it like to meet Hannah?
So you guys did math together?
No, the golden ratio is a formula that determines beauty.
One to 1.618.
I see some, uh, particulates here, Dr. Hodgins.
You know, if we still care about finding out what happened to these poor people.
I just assumed that when you guys got back from your trip, you'd be a real couple.
We were never a couple.
Of course not.
I'm happy for Booth.
Why would I be jealous?
Because it's obvious you and Agent Booth were attracted to each other.
I mean, a blind man could see that.
I just couldn't understand why you two just didn't rip each other's clothes off.
I mean, just get all butt-naked and...
It just popped out, okay?
Truthfully, baby, neither can I. So, are you sure that the press corps is gonna be exciting enough for you?
I'll make sure it is.
We have all the time in the world now.
They put me up at the Dupont Hotel.
All right, listen, stop by later, okay?
Here's my key to my place.
How can I help you?
Um, a guy I work with told me about another murder out there almost ten years ago.
Anyway, he beat this guy so bad, he died.
When I heard we were both combat vets, I guess I wanted in on a little bit more action than I get out in the park.
No, I just thought that...
Tell you what, when I'm in the park, you're my guy.
Thanks.
Thanks for this.
Guess I'm still just trying to do that little something extra is all.
Hey, tell you what, while you're here, why don't you go and pick up an application.
The bureau's always looking for a few good men, and, I mean, with your service record...
Okay, that's gross.
You are not playing with our children without supervision.
I'm retrieving pollen that would've been present when they took their last breath.
Suddenly what I'm doing is pretty cool, isn't it?
And you get to eat whatever you'd like, because you're gonna look like the Hindenburg anyway.
Nice, nice.
More to love, you know?
I got a match through the DMV, which led to a missing persons report filed by her boss.
Oh, victim, who art thou?
No, I'm not gonna talk about Hannah.
Oh, I just want you to know that I understand this could be a loaded situation, and if you need any help...
Maybe you should take care of your own house first.
I imagine you're referring to me and Daisy.
I'm gonna go try and solve a murder, okay?
Don't forget the SPF.
She was my marketing manager.
Um, she'd only worked for me for a few months, but, uh, it wasn't like her to just disappear.
She p-put on the brakes.
You recognize this man?
Sure, it's George Clooney.
Yes, she's in Afghanistan.
I don't think he expected it to happen like this.
Well, you've also found a mate, although you never expected to be in a long-term, monogamous relationship.
Yeah, well, love sort of decided that for me.
Like Cam, she never expected to be a parent.
So I'm the only one living the life I expected.
Well, how is that, honey?
It's, um... it's as I expected.
May I?
I, uh, found time of death.
I cross-referenced the pollen from the nasal cavity with the pollen charts at the Forest Service.
They died two weeks ago on the 13th.
I'll tell Booth.
Goddess on high.
Mother of my unborn child.
Love of my life.
He had a history of mental illness.
Got into a big fight with a camper and ended up beating him to death.
Got eight years for manslaughter.
What does this have to do with the 13th?
Well, he was released two weeks ago, on the 11th.
Parole officer says he lives right outside the park.
So Hinkle was diagnosed with bipolar and cyclothymic disorder with episodes of paranoia.
Okay, so why would they let him out?
Well, the attending psychiatrist feels that his illness is under control.
He's taking his meds, hasn't had a serious episode in over three years.
Booth.
Sure.
What are you staring at?
Well... you could be self-conscious 'cause I know your history with Dr. Brennan.
I mean, you know, it's natural to have mixed feelings...
Because my life is just way better when we're together.
Now, let's get on your little shrinky mojo so that you can pick up any leftover crazy that the other doctors might have missed.
Stop staring at me like that.
I could either tell your parole officer that you were belligerent or cooperative.
Which do you think he'd be happier with?
If you got a question, you just ask it.
Yeah, a couple was found dead here in the park, two days after you were released.
Yeah, I guess I should have expected this.
Expected to be caught?
He means he expected to be perceived as the man he was.
That's what your doctor told you?
I know what I did was wrong.
Of course, why should anybody else believe that?
You have court-ordered therapy sessions twice a week.
No.
Do you recognize these people?
It's not George Clooney, okay?
You know, honestly, your whole mojo is just disappointing.
But my mojo's good.
The injuries on the female indicate that the left posterior ribs eight through 11 shattered, piercing the heart, lungs and kidneys.
Her scapula is also broken, which could have pierced the lung.
His injuries were more presented in the anterior and weren't as severe.
Internal bleeding would have taken much longer to kill him.
He could've gone for help.
No one would deliver a beating so... carefully.
Seeley tells me you're the best partner he's ever had.
I like a person who isn't hampered by modesty.
I have two Peabodys, a National Press Award, and I've been wounded three times getting stories.
I kick Christiane Amanpour's ass.
We are both quite impressive.
Booth never told me how you met.
It was outside Marja.
The Taliban controlled the area, and I was going in to interview one of the leaders.
She was told not to go in, but, of course, it didn't matter, she goes in.
I was heading to a cafe, walking across this little town square, and an insurgent opened fire.
Anyway, Seeley was there.
I didn't notice at the time-- he was hidden, of course.
I was scrambling for cover.
The sniper was still firing when I heard another shot ring out.
The sniper dropped-- wounded, not killed, because he might have information.
Seeley never went for the kill if he could help it.
He saved your life.
You know what, we met on the field.
Let's just leave it at that, shall we?
Brennan.
Oh, Booth is here, too.
I'll put you on speakerphone.
Yeah, I just told you-- aphids.
So I hatched the eggs, and it turns out the aphids are wingless.
I just read the piece where you stuck it to CENTCOM in 2009.
So, wingless aphids, they couldn't have existed where we found the remains.
They live in windier environments at a higher altitude.
Thanks, Hodgins.
Sorry, I don't recognize either one of 'em.
But, then, hundreds of people come to the park every day.
If anything was found, I'm sure it would be in the lost and found.
There doesn't seem to be anything in the cabin.
I filled out my application like you said.
You know, if, uh, we work well together, maybe you'll give me a recommendation, brothers in arms, and all.
We'll see what happens.
Talk about the love shack!
Couples have been known to use the shelter for the... occasional romantic interlude.
Like a fig tree.
Beg your pardon?
I was trying anything to get an idea of the mystery man, so I analyzed the strontium isotope composition of his teeth.
Well, the remaining tissue I collected from his hands shows a high level of nicotine.
So he had green tobacco sickness.
So the initials "FV" would probably be Spanish in origin.
But Hillary Fuller was a college-educated woman with a good job at a marketing firm.
Why would she be romantically involved with a migrant worker?
See if the victims share any additional genetic or environmental markers.
So, she was a marketing director and he was a migrant worker.
I can't believe they were a romantic couple.
Just because they had different backgrounds, what, you're saying that they can't be in love?
Your belief in the power of love is admirable, Booth, but an affair between these two is an anthropological anomaly.
Yeah, I mean, crossing class boundaries that extreme would be rare and indicate that our victims had something in common we haven't discovered yet.
So it's not possible for two people to overcome their differences?
Sometimes when I was away, I would imagine us together.
But you were lucky enough to meet someone with whom you have parity.
Do you guys want to talk about this?
'Cause I figure since Hannah is now a part of your life...
Osteopenia.
Both victims exhibit low bone mass and suppressed bone formation.
All right, thanks.
So both of them had stopped drinking.
So you've probably been coming here for a while, huh?
This is a safe environment.
We don't rat out our friends here.
Just want to ask you a few questions about Hillary Fuller.
She used to live in this area, so this was probably her meeting.
I ain't talking to no cop.
Don't be such an ass-hat, Hank.
I knew Hillary.
What happen, she fall off the wagon?
We believe murdered.
Do you recognize this man?
He killed her?
He seems so nice in the movies.
No, this is the other victim who was found with Hillary.
His initials are F.V.
He does kind of look like George Clooney.
They were found in Taylor National Park in a cave.
Makes sense.
I do miss the coffee here, though.
Were Hillary and Felix romantically involved?
It's not supposed to happen with your sponsor, but they just kind of clicked.
And he was having some trouble at home-- guess his girlfriend was getting jealous because Hillary was helping Felix stay sober.
I guess his girlfriend couldn't handle it.
But that's life, right?
Things change.
Do you know where we can find Felix's girlfriend?
Felix was no saint.
He might have been a teacher in Guatemala, but here he was just a drunk-- you have his record there.
Right, drunk and disorderly, buying alcohol for a minor, petty theft.
I'm just trying to find out who killed Felix, and right now you're looking like a good suspect.
Aw, screw you, man.
I was always there for him.
Well, you don't seem too upset to find out that he's dead.
All right, so... you weren't needed anymore once he got sober.
Right?
I wasted my time with him-- he wasn't a real man.
A real man can take a drink, he can still party-- he was not a man.
He was to another woman.
That must have made you angry.
Why didn't you report him missing?
Because I just thought he'd run off with that bitch.
So you followed him to the woods just to make sure that was true.
You found him in the woods?
I got allergies-- I don't go to the woods.
Oh, people do crazy things when they're angry.
Can you account for where you were on the 13th, Lupe?
I don't have to talk to you.
I know.
No, not that.
I guess I'm just jealous of what you two do together.
The action in the field.
You're gonna make trouble while you're here, aren't you?
As much as possible.
Isn't that why you love me?
That's definitely one of the reasons.
But I'm trouble, remember?
Yes, these are the tires from Lupe Rojas's car.
She denies going to the park, but Booth doesn't believe her.
You know, you could be my lovely assistant.
Yes, but since I'm your boss, you're my lovely assistant.
Well, at least I'm lovely.
I've reexamined the injuries, but I haven't found anything new.
Because you've been looking at them as if both victims were attacked and beaten.
Because an assistant who doesn't think for himself has no value to me.
Okay, but I thought that...
No, you didn't-- that's the point.
Evidence, by the way, you were supposed to supply while I was busy with other duties.
Okay, I'm gonna assume that I missed something here.
I can guarantee that you missed something.
Someone's altered your relationship with Booth, Dr. Brennan.
No, no, I see what Dr. Brennan means.
That was very kind.
But if they weren't beaten, why did Dr. Hodgins find traces of sedimentary rock in their wounds?
Because they fell on rocks.
I apologize, Dr. Brennan.
Accepted.
Those people in Chicago... were... foolish to lose you, Dr. Edison.
Thank you.
It's actually quite amusing to think that Hannah could ever affect my work.
So I input all of the injuries and breaks that were found on both of the victims.
You can see that they share mirror fractures on their chests and pelvises.
They're compression fractures that they share because he landed on top of her.
This also explains why his zygomatic and maxilla are shattered.
His face struck the rocks directly.
Now, here are the injuries on her back.
And I found some photographs of the area surrounding the cave.
I used topographical overlay software to find the rocks that would match their injuries.
So this section of the rocks here is the section that matches their injuries.
It's about 250 feet from the cave.
Well, with the amount of blood loss they both were suffering, they couldn't have made it any farther.
This is the spot.
Well, I want a forensics team to come and, you know, brush through all these rocks.
They fell from up there.
It's a vista point.
Usually only experienced hikers go up there.
We're just going to verify your story.
Because I knew you wouldn't believe me if you knew I drove out there.
All ready.
What are we ready for?
What are those?
Well, you know, you said you followed them to the top of the trail, till you couldn't go any further.
I feel really uncomfortable about this.
Should be fun.
You said you were going to give me a chance to clear myself.
These are plants that grow at the higher altitudes in the park.
Let's start with that one.
What are you, witches?
This is dogwood.
Not looking good, Lupe.
And this is the honeysuckle.
She's telling the truth, Booth.
Her allergies are severe and she wouldn't have been able to continue following them up there.
I'm going to go get an antihistamine.
I think I found something.
Most of the flesh was decomposed or eaten by parasites, except for this area, around his eye and cheek.
Flesh is desiccated, and seems to be untouched by scavengers.
This tissue from around his eye contains capsaicin.
Pepper spray?
Yes, but at a very high concentration.
Government issue.
We looked at Felix's rap sheet a little closer, and the minor he bought liquor for was your niece.
She drank too much and got into a car accident.
And she died.
Isn't that right, Gary?
I saw him hiking with that woman.
I recognized him from court.
When they left the cabin, I... followed them.
Your sister-in-law's been through enough.
She lost your brother in Afghanistan and then her daughter.
They let him off with a slap on the wrist.
He needed to pay.
What about the woman?
e was defending him, saying that he turned his life around.
This isn't war, Gary.
He killed Sarah.
She never had a chance to turn her life around.
So you sprayed them with pepper spray, and you pushed them off the cliff.
I did the right thing.
For Sarah and my brother.
Nobody's ever going to tell me I didn't do the right thing.
How could that have made their deaths any less horrible?
No, but he didn't have to go.
He could have walked farther and gotten help.
It's giving your life, if necessary, to that person.
I mean, it's, uh, it's love.
Well, I could never live like that.
Survival is the human imperative.
If we don't look out for ourselves, nothing else matters.
Hey, Temperance.
Hello.
So, you guys catch a bad guy?
Do you want to go?
Oh, no, thanks.
I have to catalog all the forensics.
I don't mind.
Have a good night.
So, I'll see you tomorrow, then.
We'll dish about Seeley.
Come on, let's go.
What's a babe like her doing with a brown banana like Skinner?
Maybe she's one of those sexy school supply company reps.
Ah, if it isn't Eavesdrop Ernie and the Listen-In Bunch.
I'd like you boys to meet Dahlia Brinkley.
She's the only Springfield Elementary alum ever to advance to the Ivy League!
There's a car in the parking lot with a Yale sticker on it.
It's gotta be you!
I just graduated from Yale, and thought I'd pay a visit, from Yale, to the little school where it all began.
Well, that depends.
Uh, that's it.
Two clubs?
Well, that's a bridge bid, not an Ivy League application.
But I'm only in second grade.
Sweetie, you can still go to McGill-- the Harvard of Canada.
Anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything.
Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you.
It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!
Bart, call me Walter Matthau, 'cause I'm a bad-news bearer.
I'm resigning as manager of your Little League team.
I just don't like the monster I've become.
Homie, maybe you could do it.
You know, someday these kids will be out of the house, and you'll regret not spending more time with them.
That's a problem for future Homer.
Man, I don't envy that guy.
Son, how would you like to spend the summer building wooden boats by hand with master craftsmen?
How'd you like to kiss my ass?
Look at me, I'm Whitey Ford!
We got a new coach!
No, we can't stand the idea of someone who knows nothing about baseball coaching a baseball team.
Hey, there have been plenty of female managers in baseball.
Those are dudes!
It's too bad, 'cause he's a great hitter, but it's worth it.
Fine, you can be our coach.
Wrong sport.
I mean the point guard.
Also wrong.
I'm gonna do a little research.
A little's not gonna be enough, honepie.
Don't call me honey pie.
You got it, tootsie pop.
Get a room, you two.
We're brother and sister.
So are my parents, I think.
Hey, Dad?
The only thing I know about strategy is that whatever the manager does, it's wrong, unless it works, in which case he's a button-pusher.
I hate guys that just push buttons all day.
You just push buttons all day.
You know, ever since Obama came in, you've got all the answers, don't you?
Uh, the guys in that booth down there.
As a pitcher, Cliff Lee is clearly superior to Zack Greinke.
Oh, Lisa, baseball is a game played by the dexterous, but only understood by the Poin-dexterous.
If you understand what I've laid out there.
I made baseball as much fun as doing your taxes!
Using sabermetrics, even an eight-year-old girl can run a ball club with the sagacity of a Stengel, and the single-mindedness of a Steinbrenner.
I call it a Stein-stengel...
Thanks, guys.
You mean our SOBO?
Let's calculate it now!
What's the conversion factor for ginger beer?
Refreshingness over effervescence.
Plus or minus tang.
Oh, why did I advertise my drink specials in Scientific American?
I haven't seen this many books in a dugout since Albert Einstein went canoeing.
Everyone shift towards right!
I caught a white apple!
Your spreadsheets!
Oh, my stupid sister's taken the fun out of baseball.
What happened to stealing bases, the suicide squeeze, throwing a little chin music?
This isn't the game I grew up with, the game played in the misty ballparks of Enron Field, or Pac Bell, then SBC, now AT T Park.
Bart Simpson on deck, his bat's just hungering for a homer, like Chronos for his children.
Bart, this guy's walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we win the game.
Don't swing at anything!
But I'm on a hot streak.
Hot streaks are a statistical illusion.
I wish you were a statistical illusion.
Well, there's a 97 % chance I'm not, so do what I say.
Don't swing.
I've ruined your favorite thing!
You disobeyed your manager!
Get him out of here, boys.
Conflicted, conflicted, conflicted.
But he socked a walk-off dinger.
Managers manage, and players play.
Do alligators alligate?
I don't know... yes!
I'm scared.
No, it's not.
I'll put a stop to this nonsense.
Lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team?
Fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever.
Sorry Marge, I got to call bullcrap on that.
The '69 Mets will live on forever, but do you think anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's wife and kids?
Not me, and, I assume, not Ron Swoboda!
What about Bart's feelings?
With all this racket, my boys can't get their 16 hours sleep.
Anyone else think he's better than the laws of probability?
Well, you're not!
With me here in the booth is brand-new color commentator and former Isotots great, Bart Simpson.
Bart, do you miss the game?
I'm sure you do.
And it's about time.
Hey, let's hold hands and skip inside.
Well, let's go to the bleachers.
I brought an air horn and a megaphone.
Testing...
Actually, I'm taking you on a "special little guy super happy fun" day.
Are you taking me to the dentist?
You're not going to the dentist.
I'm actually starting to forget about...
She wants to talk to you.
Bart, I need you.
Ralph can't play, 'cause he's too juiced.
I didn't know what I was putting into my body.
Son, you should always listen to your manager.
Mike Scioscia!
Didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the Springfield Nuclear Plant?
I sure did, and it gave me super-managing powers!
I also demagnetize credit cards.
Bart, I have two pieces of advice.
A player should always listen to his skipper.
That's how I got these three World Series rings.
But you owe it to your sister, and the great game of baseball-- wacky face for the camera-- to go back and help your team.
Yes, it is.
Did someone order a happy ending?
Kidding.
And that's why anyone who invested with Lenny Dykstra really should call that number.
Lawyers are standing by.
And there he goes!
He's stealing third.
I'm stealing home!
Yes, well apply more goose grease.
It's the most exciting play in baseball.
If he makes it, that's my son!
You're out!
The Isotots lose.
You stink!
Did I make it?
I guess your computer was right.
Maybe it was, but according to my calculations, you're a great brother 51 % of the time.
And according to my gut, you're okay, too.
Can you put a number on it?
None of them do.
And if he were a star, he probably would be.
You hear that, Mr. Manager?
I found you a show, Drama, you just have to be open to it.
- I like monkeys.
Tipping off the paparazzi to Vince's whereabouts now?
All right, peace out.
Cheers.
I don't think you want to mix tequila and vodka, Vince.
Do we need these?
- But do you want 'em?
- He needs to get back to work.
I said I didn't want to have sex and that's how you took it.
- Do you want to talk?
I am so embarrassed and so humiliated.
As am I. Horrible things were written about me and my workplace.
- Horrible things that you said.
- Fine, I'll read it.
Was it also funny that you asked Lizzie Grant if she signed a client with a pen or with his cock?
But you said these things!
I don't know if I said all of them.
- You knew the man you married.
- And now the whole world does!
The kids at school, their parents... my mother!
I had to try to do some damage control.
That's what I can't get over... that you put more importance on the business than the people in your family.
Told you to slow down last night.
I'll be fine.
- That's great.
- An adult film.
Uh, I thought you weren't doing that anymore.
- Well, what are they offering you?
- 200 grand.
Well, you're not gonna do it.
I'm sorry, that sounded like a demand, not a question.
You're surprised that I don't want you to fuck another dude on camera?
It's a five-guy gangbang so nobody gets any one-on-one time with me.
I thought getting the word out about Avión would be a good thing.
It would be, if we could provide the tequila, Turtle.
We don't have the capacity.
Our factory can't handle it.
Well, could we expand the factory maybe?
The plan is to grow starting with Vince's ad campaign which is still months away.
But if you can get the money, you'd expand now?
I can't believe you sent it to the studio when I told you how much I hate it!
I can't believe you don't appreciate the fact that they love it and you basically have a greenlit show.
- Hang on, hang on.
- I'm not that desperate, Lloyd.
- What about your mortgage payments?
- What's up?
About tequila and money.
- It's time for the staff meeting.
- Oh joy.
And what are we working on today?
Kissing our employees' asses so no work gets done and we don't get sued.
This is coming from a lawyer, Ari, who we pay a lot of money to.
Now be careful or else!
You're doing a fine job today, Jake.
Good morning, everyone.
- I must take that.
The good news is everyone knows how much I hate staff meetings, so thankfully there is no chance of me getting irritated and saying something bad.
Take it away, Babs.
I have to say I'm impressed that I could get you with everything that's going on.
That way Wallace and the studio will be happy and we can move ahead as planned.
You know, look, I'd hoped that you would be reasonable.
Listen, sweetheart, you want to call and butter me up with sympathy, and then drop this on me because you think that I'm down and will kowtow to anything, let me explain this to you in a metaphor you will understand:
I am sure there are guys who have fingered you in the ass long enough that eventually you let them fuck it.
And now you think you got me bent over with your finger in my ass, thinking I'm gonna let you do the same.
I am not like you, Dana.
- I think she's a little bit more than that.
And I don't think you can give her money in order to control her.
What does E say?
I don't think Eric Murphy's rules of dating apply to a porn star.
- What do you say?
- I say lose her.
- That's all.
She really your girlfriend?
Yeah, I guess she is.
Listen, can you get some more of that stuff from the other night?
First I'm gonna call Sasha.
We need the money to fill the orders and then everyone gets paid.
Dana Gordon's on the phone.
I went to Ari last year for the limo business.
He told me I had no plan and he wouldn't help.
Last year I went at this half-assed, but now I got something real, something people will thank me for.
- So what are you going to do?
- I'm gonna go back to Ari.
You think he'll thank you for it?
Eventually.
So what, people are just gonna keep coming out of the woodwork?
Your therapy appointment is in 10 minutes.
- Ari, I need to talk to you.
- I'm fine.
What scandal have you been involved with?
There was that little incident on "Arrested Development."
If you haven't heard about it, there's no reason to hear about it.
- I have to go.
- Go, but, you know, this is a time to be cautious and caring.
- I appreciate the apology.
- I appreciate you accepting.
But if you were my boyfriend you think you would?
That's a start.
What is all this?
You said you liked oysters, I got oysters.
Dana Gordon just called me and we got a little issue.
- What kind of issue?
- What did Ari say?
- He told them to go fuck themselves, but he's dealing with his own shit.
This is not a precedent I want set.
- E, it's not gonna happen.
What happened?
And he said he's going to see Dana Gordon.
Well, I gotta take off, so enjoy.
- What do you hear from Drama?
- What's wrong with Vince?
Vince and your body double down the hall there were doing a little sniffle sniffle at the party the other night.
- Come on, you're lying.
- Just don't let it get back to me.
All I do is try to avoid conflict.
Get Vince on the phone, please.
Hey, it sounds like you guys got some business to take care of.
Then whose fucking fault was it, Scott?
- Vince isn't answering.
- Put him through to my cell.
I have fought tooth and nail with the network to get him his own show and he needs to be worked on... really?
Look, that's just the way Drama is.
But Ari's not here right now and I'm not sure how soon he'll be back, so...
We'll wait.
It's nice to see you find your voice.
When has she not had her voice?
I haven't heard this kind of proactive conviction from her side.
- Since the merger you've been elsewhere.
- Don't be ridiculous!
Yes, I know he loves me, but...
I know he loves me...
I know he loves me, but it's always on his terms.
- I'd like to lay out mine.
- What are they?
Well, first off, no BlackBerries in the house.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Will you try that?
We can try that.
Fantastic.
And no more promises you don't keep.
- Let's stay away from the abstract.
- Okay, if you break another promise or lie to me, I'll have to... seriously reevaluate our relationship.
Do you hear what she's saying?
No, who could?
And fuck you with your fucking clock!
And I want you to work on your anger too.
- Have you ever tried Lexapro?
- I have begged him to try Zoloft.
Baby, I am who I am, but I love you.
I don't want to break anymore promises, so I won't make them.
Let's think about this.
- Do I get any requests?
- I don't think that's wise.
- Will you let her speak?
Hell, let's have Doc move in with us, but please, let me check this message.
- Fine.
We'll talk about this next week.
Vince, we ask lots of our actors to take drug tests.
Actors with no history of drug use?
No arrests?
- No offense, but that's his problem.
Dana, I appreciate all you've done for me in the past, but I'm not taking a drug test and I don't want to be asked again about it.
If my word isn't good enough for you guys, find someone else whose word is.
No, but he'll be back in less than five.
We're wheels up in 90 minutes.
We'll wait five minutes, no longer.
Is this a real business Vince has got?
It could be with a little push.
We're just starting to put the funding together now.
This is my business partner Ken Austin... he's in charge of funding.
- Do you like tequila, Ken?
Be at Van Nuys in 90.
He was very aggressive.
- So what now?
There's a couple of parts in this movie I think you'd be good for.
- What did the studio lady say?
- I haven't asked her yet 'cause I wanted to see if it was okay with you.
- I don't want any favors.
And you think this will stop me from doing the other thing.
- Then you'll do it.
- You're supportive?
- Get me a part with really cool superpowers and maybe I won't do it.
You like it.
- Uh, 'cause I'm swimming and Turtle broke the waterproof phone.
- Are you pissed at me about something?
- Are you gonna calm down?
I'm naked.
You're in a free fall.
You know, I was waiting for this little naive judgment to come out.
All of us in this town do on some level, but I'm telling you get off it.
It wasn't her coke, all right?
It was some girl and she was here and she had it and I did it.
Yeah well, now you got the studio insecure.
Come on.
Well, he's a fucking asshole for telling them that.
I said okay.
- And Sasha.
- She didn't hear any of this.
And as my manager I want you to call the studio and find out if there's a role in "Air-Walker" for her.
Release Sophia and the rest of the detainees, like you promised to.
That promise was based on the premise that we were both being honest with each other.
Mr. President, I don't need to hear your excuses.
Release Sophia and the detainees, or this time, people will die.
It's burning!
Why can't somebody tell me what the hell is going on?
Please just tell me what the hell is going on.
What is happening?
Blood tests show no sign of viral or bacterial infection.
I think we're looking at a foreign, or, possibly extra-terrestrial organism.
Well, then at least we have clarity about who is doing this to them.
Sophia's people, this group of sleepers, including this man, Thomas, that she kept secret from us all these years.
Regardless of the cause of infection, do we have a way to treat them, to make them better?
We've tried everything, it's impossible to treat what we don't understand.
If the passengers continue to decline at this rate, none of them will be alive by morning.
Mr. President, a man identifying himself as Thomas just called in to the White House switchboard, asking to speak to you.
We're attempting to run a voice match to the first call you received from him.
Oh, I'll recognize his voice.
You're on the line with the President.
Meet my demands, and I'll get it to you.
Your demands?
You know I can't do that.
Then this conversation's over, and the passengers will die.
You listen to me, you son of a bitch... you have two hours, to make arrangements for the release of my people.
I'll call you back then.
Thomas!
They spotted us, they'll be here soon.
I can't abandon them.
No.
Now, go.
Thomas, we have to stop.
Let people rest.
Not yet.
Everybody, wait here until we know it's safe.
It's empty.
It doesn't look like anybody's been here in a while.
We're trapped here.
We can't just leave them behind.
Come take a look at this.
What is it?
They're still using vacuum tubes.
They're nowhere near the level of technology we're gonna need to get back.
We'll figure something out.
That's easy for you to say.
Sophia didn't saddle you up with getting it done.
It'll take years.
No luck with the trace, sir.
Oh, you're right, you don't need to tell me that.
Yeah.
We both know what kind of man Martinez is.
They're all going to die anyway.
Any luck?
No, it's going straight to voicemail.
I also tried calling my mom and dad, but they're not picking up.
We'll be celebrating 15 years come this January.
How long are we gonna keep this up?
If she doesn't connect with Walker before daybreak, we're gonna have to pull out.
He'll call.
All Sean's thinking about is finding Leila.
I just got the final orders.
Gonna have to keep this short, Europe just opened.
What do you mean, is she okay?
I hope so, I'm trying to find her.
Look, I need you to run a locate on a cell phone number.
Sean, what did you get yourself into?
What's the number?
Uh, my friend ran Vicky's number but didn't get a hit.
Her phone might be off.
Well, he'll keep trying, and then he'll call me if he finds her location.
Sean?
She's at a police station in Snyder.
I don't think that's too far from here.
Snyder police department.
It's for you.
Is it you?
No, I'm okay.
I had to shoot her to get away.
I believe you.
I have the address, okay, so I'm coming for you, all right?
Okay, I can't wait to see you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Can I go to the bathroom?
Well, of course, it's down the hall to your left.
No!
Get off me!
Doctor!
Clear.
Okay, he's back.
Help me.
I couldn't sleep.
What's going on?
It's the passengers, they're getting worse.
They're infected by something, by this man, Thomas.
Well, do you think he's telling the truth, that he really has a cure?
I don't know that it matters.
You're not thinking of letting them die?
Elias, he's only asking you to do what you were going to do anyway.
You were minutes away from releasing the detainees.
We can't let them out, until we understand what they really want, what they're doing here.
You sound like Blake sterling.
Elias, I know you.
If there's even a small chance that you can save these people's lives...
I'm aware of that.
And what have you decided, Mr. President?
Don't bother.
Don't bother, I'm not releasing any of them.
It's not going to happen.
You accept the terms to my deal.
Here's the new deal.
You wouldn't.
How long have you been living here?
We were all counting on you.
How could you leave everyone behind like that?
Without a clue as to where you were going, and why?
That's not the point.
Yeah?
They're calling it the Manhattan Project.
Do you know what they're going to use this for?
This country is at war, Thomas.
This termination protocol would be the best way to proceed should we not receive the antidote.
Termination protocol.
Uh, the idea is to seal off the prisoners living quarters and pump carbon monoxide from the physical plant into the air ducts.
That's barbaric.
We can have it back online in under two hours.
Mr. President, are you having second thoughts about this?
Because reneging on your threat at this point, would be the worst of all possible scenarios.
Do it.
I had to dig out the original blueprints but it's been there all these years.
This thing is real.
His pride is blinding him.
He's gone too far.
He's not the same man I put in charge back then.
I can't sit here and let him sacrifice the lives of all those innocent people.
I tried to tell him we couldn't allow that to happen, but he wouldn't listen to me.
But he will listen to me.
I don't care if it means I have to spend another 66 years in this damn prison.
You tell him to release the antidote now, before any of those poor people die.
And make sure he understands it's an order.
I hope you're here to tell me you talked sense into the President.
He wouldn't have listened to me, even if I tried.
I'm done taking orders from Sophia.
It's like you once told me, she put me in charge for a reason.
Over my dead body.
What are you gonna do to me, huh?
Don't you get it?
The President isn't going to back down.
Neither am I.
Then you're sentencing your own people to death.
That's it?
Hey, Sean will be here any minute.
I'll take the roof.
Call me with a heads up when you get the visual.
I have orders and I have no choice but to follow them.
Even if that means killing innocent people it's that simple for you?
No one told me there'd be a baby.
It's done.
I'm just going to go lay down, okay?
Here we go.
Leave?
We know they're monitoring law enforcement, okay?
We can't call for help.
We don't even know how many people are in there.
And we don't know how much longer they're going to keep Leila alive, we have to get her out now!
Maybe we do.
Who is this?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Of course you don't.
There are other people in here, you don't know what you're doing.
You know I don't want to do this, but you didn't really give me much of a choice.
Did she go for it?
I don't know.
Take this.
He's heading your way.
Fed's staying in the car.
Walker's coming in alone.
Stay down!
Leila, stand back, I'm gonna kick the door down.
Oh, God.
I will use it.
Go.
Now.
Get in.
I'm not sure how they knew, somebody must have talked.
No, they got Carter too, I'm the only one left.
We'll get someplace safe.
Then he and I are going to have a little talk.
You came.
Mr. President, it's three minutes past the deadline, and no antidote has been forthcoming.
The termination protocol is ready.
Just one more minute.
Where's the antidote?
Then, there's nothing more we have to talk about.
And you will have the deaths of Sophia, and the detainees on your hands.
Are we done?
You heard what I said.
Give me just one.
Give me one of my people, and I'll get you the antidote.
Who?
Agreed.
Take Sophia to the Farragut North Metro Station, put her on the Red Line, scheduled to depart at 8:16, no one on the train, or in the station.
I need you to put a tracking device on her, something that she can't easily get rid of.
He's your new priority.
I have the President for you.
I had no choice but to release you, Sophia, so don't mistake this for kindness or trust.
I won't, but I hope to regain both.
Keep that promise, we'll start from there.
I understand, Mr. President.
I spoke to Rachel.
She told me you were able to get the antidote.
Yeah, the passengers are already getting better.
She told me how you got it.
Elias, if it didn't work out, would you have... would you have done it, and gone through with your threat and murdered the detainees?
That's not an answer.
Well, honey, it's the only answer I have right now.
Sophia's train is proceeding east.
We're getting a clear signal from the scandium-46 in her bloodstream.
I'm counting on you.
Whoever dosed the people at the coffee shop did it with the same isotope we used on Sophia.
Agent Lee, someone needs to check you.
- Who were they?
I'm sorry.
Do you have any idea how many innocent lives you just took?
No, there had to be a better way.
We were outnumbered.
Or was the building about king a point to show them what you could do?
It's good to see you, Sophia.
And you, Aaron.
Reinforcements are being brought in from all over the city.
We need to be on our way.
How many of our men were in that building?
How many?
We're currently estimating between 15 and 30 men were still in the building en that happened.
They were ahead of us every step of the way.
Can you tell me anything that's gone right with your operation?
Because this is a disaster.
How could this possibly have happened?
It happened because Sophia's people have an informant in our ranks.
I felt it would be more pertinent once we had actually discovered who the informant was.
That's correct.
Mr. Murphy went into the field, hoping to root them out.
Where is he now?
We've lost contact.
He was last seen with Agent Lee, who was hurt in the collapse.
Once Agent Lee recovers from his wounds, hopefully we'll find Murphy and the informant.
If you can't trust your own judgment, how the hell can you expect me to?
Find the informant, or I'll find someone else who can.
Yeah, so yesterday I told my seventh graders that they might have a surprise quiz on Gettysburg today.
You are too easy on them.
Apparently not, because even with the warning, half the class fails.
Oh, come on.
It's been ten months, three weeks, and two days, and I feel like celebrating.
Course not, father.
There are some things we need to discuss.
How is he?
Mr. Lee suffered a subdural hematoma.
Now, we were able to reduce the swelling in the cranium...
When can he talk?
Help me.
Mr. Murphy.
Do you expect us to believe that this happened to my family because of aliens?
Because he discovered the truth about aliens.
Madeline, if no one's actually seen these ebes, how can you be sure they really exist?
Sean, you're not actually taking what she's saying seriously.
Are you talking about Avias Flight 514?
The president would be stopped revealing the existence of the ebes, and your father would be stopped passing on what he found out.
What did my father find out?
Whoever this person is, they are behind everything that has happened to you.
If you want to find your family, you need to find them.
We need to hope that the answers are in that file.
I don't know about all this either, okay?
But your father's file is the best and only lead that we have to finding out who's behind this and your family.
May I take a look?
Let me see.
This is your father's notebook, and most of this stuff I've already seen, but this is new.
I just need the right kind of hardware and a ces-encrypted hard line, so that we can data mine without anyone knowing that we're doing it.
I have a friend that might be able to help.
Phalaenopsis typically only flower once every two years, but these guys are different.
Genetically engineered to open every month.
You have a call, sir.
For your wife.
A $2 million bouquet.
Where are you?
In F.B.I. Custody, Dallas field office.
I'm not sure, sir.
We really have no choice.
That'll be all.
You've done well for yourself over the last 66 years.
Our holdings are in good shape.
Their economy fluctuates up and down in a way they can't predict.
Draws all the attention to himself.
We need to talk.
I don't wanna hear about what happened to the building.
How dare you speak to me like that.
And you need to come to terms with that before anyone else gets hurt.
Is that a threat?
It's an order.
You know that.
I understand.
Do you?
Then what's past is past, hmm?
- Is he all right?
You're telling me the head of my special operations group is the informant?
Sir, there is no doubt in my mind.
I don't see how that could be possible, sir.
Yeah, how convenient for you.
Simon saved my life back there, and I wasn't the only one.
Why would he do that if he was working for the other side, sir?
This isn't productive.
You want me to help crucify my friend?
I want you to do your job.
Morning.
I'd like to know what this is about.
How are things at home, Blake?
Aren't we past this?
She's a Russian intelligence operative.
We've been trailing her for months.
She meets her contact at the Dupont circle fountain on Tuesdays.
She has drop points all over the city.
Hello, is Bobby there?
This is Bobby.
"Bobby" is Sergei Vneshney.
I know you understand what you have to do.
You don't need me for this.
Bring her in.
You asked for me, sir?
I found a lack of key verifiable points in Simon's biographical information.
Wait a minute, are you saying that...
And if he won't talk?
If that mole is Simon Lee, may God have mercy on him.
Then why isn't he answering?
Come on, Peter.
Go away, Madeline.
This is Sean Walker and Leila Buchanan.
I don't know who you are, but you're our only hope.
Everyone of us is tagged, tracked, and catalogued by what we carry.
All your personal information, scannable from a distance, by whoever has the wherewithal.
Everything like that has been taken from us.
What do you need?
We're hoping that it will lead to the people who took her family and framed me for murder.
What?
Whether they'd acknowledge that or let him out for that matter...
You cannot win.
Walk away while you still can.
Look, we're not giving up, okay?
Friend of ours at NSA ran a voice match on archived cellular traffic.
Said that they made a phone call about an hour ago.
Left a message with someone saying that the three of them needed help and were on their way.
What if what he said is true?
Do you believe that Samantha's still alive?
I honestly don't know.
- All reported missing within the last six months, all roughly the same age as your sister.
Now that I can't tell you.
- W-w-what about the other data?
I told you I shouldn't have let you in.
This and this.
You okay?
They're gone.
Hold it.
- Thank you.
- What floor?
Ground, please.
Can I ask you something?
No, sorry.
Been years for me.
Me too.
Terrible habit.
- Thanks for the tip.
You're awake.
You know I can never fall asleep when you're away.
Do you love me, Laura?
Of course I do.
What is it, baby?
What's wrong?
I know.
What?
Everything.
Everything about what?
And only by being completely honest is there any hope of this working out.
Honey, you're scaring me.
I love you.
The rest doesn't matter.
We'll say that you handled this yourself.
Get out of here!
The choice is yours.
Take the gun, Blake!
Don't throw it all away.
The receptacle used to transport the scandium-46, we found it.
I love you.
Why would you do that?
To prove Murphy's accusation that you were a sleeper.
Of course, that still leaves a multitude of unanswered questions, such as the unfortunate presence of a mole in our midst.
Luckily, a vial with the mole's prints was found.
Murphy's the mole.
I understand.
What the hell is going on?
Over the years, I helped the nuclear program along.
Nowhere near enough.
The white house just released a statement that the passengers of Avias 514 are recovering well from the effects of the substance they were exposed to onboard.
Come in.
We found the leak, sir.
I heard.
Are you actually telling me you're not perfect?
Honestly?
It's kind of a relief.
You want a beer?
Absolutely.
Where's my mom?
I want my mom and dad.
When can I see them?
Girls?
Every story has a beginning.
I'm fast.
So you turned your garage into... what every secret crime-fighter needs... a lair.
I think I liked us better when we were just dysfunctional.
So how's the costume working?
I'm just trying to protect your identity.
If enough people say they got busted by Mr. Clean, it's just a matter... okay.
Hell of a lot different than it looks during the day.
Yeah, well, welcome to Franklin Park... only place in the city you can get poison ivy, crack, and sexually assaulted all at the same time.
Are you sure that you wanna be doing this?
Or what?
You were out late last night.
What kind of male bonding experience am I being excluded from this time?
So the reward is spending Friday night with dad in a tent?
Remind me to flunk my midterms.
In a twisted turn of events, the mugger was shot by an unknown assailant and delivered right here, where he was patched up and promptly arrested.
Police would not comment when asked if this was the work of a vigilante.
Because it'd be pretty cool if it was.
Okay, everyone, grab your backpacks and meet me out front.
I said I didn't shoot anyone.
So you're saying you weren't there?
I'm saying I didn't shoot anyone.
Jim, we've been through this.
Look, I'm not happy about this hobby of yours, but I understand why you need it.
You know, but J.J. ... He worships you.
Look, I'm just trying to keep the city safe.
Well, then try to stay off the news while you do it.
Now that he finally has a thing, you're gonna complain about that?
I was hoping it'd be a hobby, like model airplanes or stamp collecting.
Call security.
Hello, ladies.
Your little plant is a high priority, which means the brass want all their top players on this.
Should I still call security?
I hope they didn't notice me pull a $50 from the register.
Maybe we can just beg Bailey to tell us where the party is.
This the guy who shot the meth head who was robbing an innocent woman?
You want me to arrest him or offer him a job?
We've got real criminals in this city, Powell, so forgive me if I move the guy who took out a felon to the bottom of the stack.
I mean, who's it gonna hurt if we let this one slide, the crackhead community?
I'll pay for it!
Yes, you will!
It's ingenious, actually, going for the "B"... not so high that you arouse suspicion, not so low that your previous work seems like an anomaly.
I'm not cheating, Mr. Litchfield.
You expect me to believe that one morning you just woke up and decided to apply yourself?
I guess you survive a plane crash, and you kinda approach life differently.
A B-plus?
Seriously, man, whatever it is you're on, can I get some?
Look, you know how I've been looking forward to our little camping trip together, but...
Worked out for the best anyway.
So when you wanted me to play, it was okay, but now that it's my idea, it's a bad one?
So you think you know what I'm cut out for, dad?
Because I don't think you have a clue.
Witnesses say the guy was wearing a gray baseball cap.
So you think Meyers took out the guy that killed his son, and he liked it so much he didn't stop?
Well, maybe we should pay Mr. Meyers a little visit.
Should I drive or do you want me to just hop on your back and we could...
Maybe you always knew you were gonna be a history teacher and a football coach or maybe you realized your calling later in life, but our dreams don't always happen on schedule.
Don't be too obvious, but he look like the guy from the park?
What?
Coffee, please.
Fan of the game?
Nothing predictable about kids, huh?
I just think he's a guy who wants to be left alone.
Yeah, but what about these lab results?
This is the blood analysis we ran on Jim and me.
This nucleopeptide sequence... it's the same abnormal chromosome that we found in Jim's blood, in my blood, in Daphne's...
I can't believe you two beat me for the research grant.
Um, hi, Bailey.
Uh, do we know each other?
Oh, I totally know where it is.
You sure you okay?
You killed him!
Girls' locker room's that way.
Let's go.
Interesting stuff.
Glad I found this before Katie hid it.
It's no wonder you two are so secretive.
Your research isn't exactly confined to your very old plant, is it?
What I can't figure out is why you'd waste valuable time studying the inconclusive data of a washed-up scientist.
When I discovered it in the archives, it was unattributed- a word of advice, doctor?
So if you give me a description of the suspect, I can create a composite.
Yeah, that's better.
The, uh, shape of his face, was it more angular?
No, it was more round, like a ball.
Big, fat, meaty face.
And, uh, his approximate age?
Sort of, uh, medium lips.
Me?
Cupid's bow.
Why do you look so worked up?
Your wife's a lucky lady.
Continuing.
Amazing!
You're putting him in?
Couldn't do any worse than you.
J.J., red-dog right.
Yeah, tell that to the guy whose neck I can't see past in health class.
But I am telling you, an ordinary differential equation supports this.
Uh, okay, boy genius, do you mind simplifying that for us regular people?
What it means is you don't have to be big or fast or athletic to be a great football player.
You can just be... you.
It's not that we don't applaud his improvement, but when a student like J.J. turns around his performance at such an alarmingly rapid rate, we can't help but consider that there are other factors at play.
Please, can you just... tell us what you think is going on with our son.
Well, we can't know for sure, but there are certain attention-focusing, performance-enhancing drugs that could account for his spike in grades and social activities.
It's... it's actually more common than you might think.
Drugs?
J.J.'s changed so much in such a short span.
I can't believe this.
Did your parents ever ask you if you were on drugs when you went out for the football team?
For the first time in my life, I am finally good at stuff because I believe in myself.
It'd be real nice if you did, too.
Okay, forget... forget- forget about the park.
You're not here.
I know what it looks like to be obsessed with your work.
I'm not obsessed.
Yeah, we know this already.
Yeah, but did you know the shooting occurred in Franklin Park?
Call me an over-reaching prosecutor, but that is more than enough to bring Meyers in for a lineup, see if the vic can I.D., and if she does, it sorta makes you a hero, doesn't it?
Get a search warrant for his home, maybe?
But he walks... for now.
There is no way we're cool enough to be here.
Sure we are.
But he so isn't.
Why do you even care?
I care because it's another lie, J.J.!
It's another one of your secrets that I have to keep, and I kept it when you lied to mom and dad because you loved how proud of you they were.
You're... abusing your powers to impress new friends.
Well, you don't need to be a genius to know that you couldn't have even gotten into this party unless you used your powers.
What are you doing here?
You mean after you let me think that it was at Alec's house?
And we have a strict "no losers" policy.
For some people, definitely.
You know what?
How?
No, I think you don't want your boss finding out that you're dipping into the cash register.
Well, can you prove it?
Because if you can't, it's your word against mine.
Attempting to buy!
Hey, you're late.
Uh, Declan and me...
The movie ran longer than we thought.
What's going on anyways?
This doesn't concern you, J.J. Just go upstairs now.
Daphne, how are we supposed to believe anything that comes out of your mouth again?
You went to work, and I was the one who dealt with the kids.
Look, this is what happens to them when we're not around.
They need a parent here.
I mean, they needed you all those years, and I was the one who covered.
When is it gonna be your turn to be the one who's here?
So I found out he was working predominantly with somatic gene therapy coupled with recombinant D.N.A.
So he was working on vaccines?
Not just that.
He was isolating vulnerabilities in the D.N.A. strand, and then he was attempting to create patches, like... sort of like genetic spackle.
Where'd he go?
So I'm like, where is Dr. Volson?
I even called my ex at the FBI to have him cross-check the F.D.I.C.
The point is that I have searched everywhere on earth for this guy, and I have finally figured out the reason why I can't figure it out.
Well, if you care about finding the vigilante, you've got the wrong guy.
It... but it doesn't matter what I think.
See, 'cause the cops think you're the shooter, and that means they're gonna come after you hard.
Turn yourself in.
I have kids, too...
Hey, I don't have a kid.
Cleaning up the park is not gonna bring your boy back.
I lost Jack a long time before that.
Everything seemed so important, and none of it mattered.
I was his father, and I should've been there.
You love your kids so much, then what the hell are you doing here with me?
Why aren't you at home with them?
Morning, everyone.
Okay, no one has anything to say to me, and that's fine, 'cause I want you all to listen.
Daphne, you abused your powers because you wanted to feel good about yourself, and you didn't give a damn about the consequences.
So... even though you lied to us about where you went last night, you did it because you felt like your efforts had been unappreciated, unnoticed.
You're going.
I've been involved in some very terrible things.
They didn't hurt our little girl, right?
And for how many of those 47 years was your husband a smoker?
He spent half his life breathing toxic dust, and now you're trying to tell me my husband died because of heartburn.
They're just young, right?
Now that President Martinez knows that there's a group of us living freely, our days here really are numbered.
Fortunately, Thomas has made a lot of progress in creating the infrastructure we'll need to get us back home, and I will be taking over that effort from now on.
I'm waiting.
I see.
The majority of the people I represent feel that way, and I think the same is true for the rest of the representatives.
Sophia, with all due respect, let's not forget the reason that we came here in the first place.
But we're going home.
Those are my orders.
Go back and tell your people that's the decision.
Did you know this was coming?
When we got here, these people couldn't even achieve nuclear fusion.
No one knows about us.
If they knew what we were planning, they would object.
But it is clear that if we go through with this, they will accept you as their new leader.
This is your time, Thomas.
What?
Trying to manipulate me.
The list of missing girls you wanted me to check on.
It confirmed your email.
All the girls are between seven and eight, and they've all been reported missing within the last two years.
But did they have anything else in common?
What did she say about the people who were holding her or-or where?
Look, all I know is that she's back with her parents.
Maybe you can find out more.
The head of his security detail shielded him and bore the brunt of the explosion.
I promise we'll find whomever's responsible.
Our men won't be able to get anywhere near him.
There is always a way, Mr. Berg.
Right now, however, I need your services on another assignment- reacquiring a girl we recently lost.
No grass grows under your feet.
Just one minute.
Well, we think that the same people who took your daughter may have Leila's sister, so you could start with telling us what she told the police.
Abby doesn't remember anything about the people who did this to her or where they kept her.
The police kept trying.
The finally let us take her home this morning.
She must have told them something.
She didn't- nothing, really.
Could you tell us where they found her?
At a truck stop in Stillwater.
She said that a driver gave her a ride there, but she didn't know where from.
Mrs. Stern?
- Okay, just- why won't you help us?
We're just trying to find her sister.
Abby, sweetie, back to your bed.
Look, we need to talk to her!
Leila, we don't have a choice.
We're sorry to bother you, sir.
If she did, she wouldn't be going with me, would she?
I talked with a friend who knows about these things.
You've handled it a lot better than I expected.
You know how I feel about how you handled President Martinez- the damage that you did.
Thomas, we could have gotten out of Inostranka any time in any number of ways.
We stayed there, because we were protecting you and the others.
It wasn't easy, but we waited, because we were strong.
When you were a little boy, you had this thing about the rain.
You were terrified of it, like it-like it was the end of the world.
And one day, I took you outside during a storm, and I let us both get drenched.
I thought that if we stayed there long enough, you would see that there was nothing to be afraid of.
I should have protected you, but I was stubborn.
That was a long time ago.
And my point is that I repeated my mistake- that I need to accept you for who you are and stop putting you in situations that you can't handle.
Where is it?
It's still viable.
I was worried it might have been damaged during the crash.
Now turn around.
Oh, it's her, isn't it?
Now it's my turn.
You don't have it in you.
Do it.
Where do you think they're going?
Well, we did, but that's not why they're leaving.
Their suitcases were packed when we got there.
Is she still in the car?
No, they're getting out right now.
No, no, please, please, Mrs. Stern...
Maybe she knows some small detail that can help me find my sister.
Just a few questions, and then I promise I will- I will leave you alone.
Thank you, Abby.
Some of us.
The nurse there says we're helping people, but bad things happened after she gave us the injections.
Okay, um, Abby, can- can you tell me about the place where they kept you?
Did you see any pictures or- or words on the buildings?
Do you remember the name of the hospital?
You know, did you see any, um- any signs anywhere?
Abby, run.
I don't know, maybe he can give us some answers.
It's okay!
Come back!
What is it?
It's Abby?
He was here for you.
If you need anything, Mr. Vice President, please let me know.
You can't.
What do you mean?
Someone came to the house.
I'm fine.
- How are the kids?
What have you done?
I'm sorry.
Isabel, you know that's not true.
I saw it in his eyes, and now I can see it in yours.
You pushed him.
But you were only giving him what he wanted- someone who would push him to be more than he truly is.
I'm so sorry.
What do you mean?
Get on your knees, Isabel.
Or what?
Give me your hand.
You're forcing me to maim myself?
Sophia, please.
We can go now.
If I wasn't wearing this suit, I would be dead in an instant!
What's your favorite movie?
How far are we from the eye?
About two minutes!
Tell me when it gets severe!
He knew the ins and outs of strange and exotic adventure, backwards and forwards.
But nothing prepared him for this one.
Where's our lunches?
What is on your feet?
Reindeer slippers.
I'm not lettin' you out of the car till I get a new word.
Pernicious.
Thank you.
Good word.
What does perni... pern... pernicious mean?
It's causing insidious harm or ruin.
Causing damage.
Dad!
Great, thank you.
Or four.
And I'll get the dish back to you within the week.
In time, then.
Benjamin, I've arrived at a thought.
Tell me, Dunc.
I believe you should court the girl we met at Jamba Juice.
She's a stunner.
She keeps callin' me to go hiking.
Benjamin, hike her.
I mean, is that what they call a stunner now?
Well, what else do we have around here?
Got Little Dom's.
I met her there.
- It's all right, man.
Take it from a guy who spent six months on a commercial fishing boat in Bali trying to find himself.
I missed people.
So just do me a favor.
Attempt to start over.
I shall try to start over.
- I love you, too, man.
You're a good guy.
Sunlight.
- Human interaction.
- Got it!
Joy.
And we do a whole thing about how life is elemental, and all the software, and laptops, and apps in the world aren't gonna change that.
That is bold stuff.
I think we should give you an online column.
If the paper goes down or gets sold, you'll still be safe.
You'll be viral.
Don't keep me around out of...
I am not!
I'm sick of sympathy.
I know.
I quit.
In some quarters, sympathy would be considered the appropriate response.
No, I'm not gonna sit around here and spin my wheels and live in a state of sponsored pity.
- You're killin' me.
Benjamin Mee.
They left the cashbox right on the counter.
It was kind of their fault if you think about it.
That's three suspensions in one semester.
That's gotta be some kind of record.
Yeah, well, maybe I'll get a prize.
- Dad, stop.
- No, I can fix it.
Dad, here he come...
Just give me one second.
I'm fine with my squeaky window, Mr. Mee.
In fact, I rather enjoy it.
Besides today's theft, there's a darkness here that we need to deal with.
Mr. Devereaux, Dylan's art teacher, wanted you to see his wall mural.
We encourage creativity at the school.
There's a nice treatment of the word "love".
A whimsical portraiture of recycling.
A hard-hitting exposé about world peace.
Here is the great Bob Marley.
Though we don't endorse all that he stood for.
Sunflowers.
And guess which one is your son's.
We're a three-strike school, Mr. Mee, and today was his fourth strike.
Let's go.
It's like he was expelling me for my artwork.
I can almost live with the artwork.
I mean, if Charles Manson needed a personal muralist, you'd be the guy.
You stole!
It breaks my heart.
Always lasagna.
Dad, someday you're gonna have to eat some of that lasagna.
Honey...
Or throw it away.
Hey, why didn't you go to Sadie's for the play date, sweetie?
Hey, Rosie?
Am I doin' anything right?
You're handsomer than the other dads.
Good.
Their happy is too loud.
It's a new day for you, Mr. B.
We have a full day of house hunting planned and I think you'll be very excited at what's available.
In the current economic environment, you're gonna find that now, the buyer is now the king.
It's gonna be very hard to find rolling hills in the city.
- I like you, too, Rosie.
I wish Dylan were here, too.
My condolences go out to you and your family, Mr. Mee.
- I know, but he should have.
- Really?
Never.
Almost.
Not quite.
We are now running out of options.
Dad.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
The Rosemoor property has some challenges.
Well, what doesn't?
You don't have to take a picture, Rosie.
Why not?
'Cause we're gonna live here.
Mr. Mee, we have to talk, okay?
This is exactly what we've been looking for.
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Well, that's a bit complicated.
Well, complicated's okay.
It's a zoo.
A zoo?
It's a zoo.
Totally scary.
This was a fully functioning zoo until two years ago.
Then it was shut down.
- Well, I mean, could I, you know, buy the property and then just relocate the animals?
And then there's the remaining staff on board and, you know.
If no one buys this property soon, these animals will probably have to be...
You understand?
Oh, God.
Great, I keep her home from school one day and she gets eaten!
Are you hungry?
I think so.
I said "human" interaction.
This is what happens when people have a you-know-what occur in their lives.
But maybe my older brother didn't see this place.
The place makes 75 % of its revenue in the summertime.
Or do what I did, when Sheila left me.
Start handicapping' horses?
Well, now, that was a little misguided.
Go into the commercial shrimping business and call myself Captain Dunk.
Start cliff diving in Acapulco at the age of 38.
All right, forget that.
It's only two zebras.
And all of them are saved the second we make this deal.
The kids are gonna be so psyched.
Look, these animals need somebody to rescue them.
A new place.
A new start.
What?
We bought a zoo!
All right, let's let this shirt start over!
Okay, two more left.
Mommy used to wear that sometimes.
Tough to give some of these things away, right?
- Keep it?
- It's time.
Let that sweatshirt start over.
We're here!
Okay, look, the Jaguar Restaurant, guys!
How great is that?
I miss our home.
And that's Crystal, our capuchin.
And Peter is our visionary.
He built the enclosures that set the standards for modern zoos all across America.
And the world.
Yeah, and the world, yes.
It's just us, Mr. Mee.
This is Rosie, my daughter.
And this is our zoo now, I guess.
So I would like to declare us all modern-day adventurers.
And sponsors of animal greatness.
How old are you?
Fourteen, I guess.
Yeah, the USDA inspector, Walt Ferris.
I'll kill him.
MacCready, stop.
Talkin' to the animals has to be done in a super specific way.
You know, he doesn't have it yet, but he'll learn.
Where'd you get your shoes?
And how much did they cost?
I thought they would roar like Solomon the Lion.
No, tigers and lions are very different.
Try, go on.
That guy there, that's Spar.
So there's a few decisions you'll have to make straightaway, Ben.
That's okay, I'll pay.
Look, they're not called cages, they're called enclosures.
They haven't been called cages in like a century.
My brief marriage, that was a cage.
Not mine.
I have a question for you.
I mean, what kind of regular person just up and buys a place like this?
You have no idea what we've been dealing with here.
We used to have three times the staff.
They all quit.
I'm here every day.
I'm pathetic!
I had to move back in with my mother.
No one gets paid, Ben jamin.
We need somebody who can really take charge of this place or else we and all these animals are gone.
So your question is?
Why did you buy this place?
Why not?
You comin'?
I will, I'll kill him.
I'll cut off his head with a sword.
I'll kill him without a thought.
And he stole $500 from me, back in the 1980s!
He's a crook!
Hi, Benjamin!
Your chair, sir.
Sloane Animal Park!
He'll never last.
Hey, guys.
You are gonna love your new enclosure.
Not at night.
You like to get a little wild at night, huh?
Listen, you're not talkin' to 'em correctly, yet, boss.
You gotta be real with 'em.
You good?
Who's that?
That's Kelly.
It's about Rosie, man.
She is happy here.
Rosie is seven.
Just make her a nice zoo screensaver and she'll be just as happy.
And it ends with you authentically living on my veloured couch with your two children.
Hey, back off.
What ya doin'?
How'd you get the nosebleed?
I slipped on the roof and banged it.
I like your drawing.
Thanks.
It's a little dark.
Where's the sun?
There's no sun in the underworld.
That I'm aware of.
So I'll come back every day at 4:15 and bring you a sandwich.
We've got the bill from the feed company.
It's a little high, 'cause somebody had them deliver on a Saturday.
How important is butter to this meal tonight?
We're gonna take a vote.
And remember, it's nine miles each way to the grocery store.
So I think the question we need to ask ourselves as a family is butter worth your dad driving 18 miles right now to get it?
Let's vote.
Long day for you, Ben?
Long day for you.
Corn's ready!
Eighteen miles for butter.
The garage.
There is a new shipment of exotic snakes, so just leave them in the travel crates and I'll put them in the exhibit in the morning.
And the monkeys need fruit as well.
I think I'll just find my pillow.
Nine point two miles.
So, technically, that's 18.4 miles for butter.
You know I found some, right?
All right, so Rosie and I'll go to the tiger enclosure and give them some water.
Why don't you just go over to the garage and make sure the lights are off in the side room?
Dad, I have a sick amount of homework tonight.
Dad!
Get it done!
Come on, Spar, you gotta take your meds.
He looks tired, Dad.
He's gonna be okay.
Isn't that right, buddy?
Dylan really loves you, you know?
I know.
He's just mad that his friends don't visit him here.
Well, they will.
Could you possibly point another fan at me?
You have three fans blowing on you.
I like it.
Now what do we have here?
It's our old friend.
I didn't think this one was gonna make the trip.
Did Mama hurt a lot before she had to leave us?
Well, do you remember the night that we were tucking you in, and you asked Mommy that?
She said sometimes people look really sick but they don't feel really sick.
Do you feel like you can't see her?
Yeah.
There you go.
And put it in your heart.
Hold it there.
She's never far away.
- Right there.
Are you ready to go to bed?
Okay, sweetheart.
Good night.
Dylan likes Lily.
She's about a foot taller.
Don't be a tiny person.
- I'm an idiot.
- Dude!
I'll call Kelly.
This one seems really not happy with me.
Glad you guys are enjoyin' yourselves.
Dad, there's nothin' you could say to me that's more harsh than what I'm sayin' to myself!
Well, I disagree!
I just want you to be happy, man.
Unless you don't want to be happy.
What is so great about being happy?
That you're happy.
I'm sorry I messed up the box of snakes.
Whatever!
You're not supposed to say that in this century.
He's so patronizing to me!
It's good for the tigers to feel like they're searching for their food like they do in the wild.
Awesome.
Hey, I'm pretty sure this is none of my business, but I noticed that your kid really pushes your buttons.
You give him a lot of rope.
I did not appreciate the way he kicked that garter snake.
Hey, wait, I feel like I should be helping you here.
It's all good.
Yeah, look, he's 14, and he went through somethin' that no kid should ever have to go through, so I'm givin' him a little bit of leeway.
Look, honestly, I don't know.
I'm not good with people.
You're doing very well.
You know, I expected you to be heading for the hills by now.
Well, we got through today.
Yeah, we got through today.
Well, it looks like he's decided to pay a hello visit.
Yeah, but we're not even close to ready.
Okay, got it.
- Pleasure.
Our inspection happens a week before we open, according to my information.
So I've asked for June 30th, which would get us open by July 7th. 7 /7.
We've only just really arrived here, Mr. Ferris.
A pop by, Mr. Mee, is, by its very definition, a surprise.
Now, we're responsible for the upkeep, not just the granting of licenses.
Welcome to the business of live-animal maintenance, Mr. Mee.
It's a real fun party.
Where's your zookeeper?
I have you down as an assistant.
Now why would you buy this place?
I just can't get a handle on it.
You know, actually, quite a lot's been written about the innovative design of these enclosures built by Peter MacCready.
I know all about MacCready.
I've been coming here long before you.
And I know what's in the Jaguar, too.
You're eight inches short.
That's regulation.
New guidelines are being raised this year.
Raise the barrier heights, too.
I'd make that first priority, as well.
We're just dealin' with a little bit of hip dysplasia.
Have you begun to draw up an end-of-life plan?
The endgame on a big cat can be very costly.
I understand, but we're not there yet.
Thank you for your concern.
I guess I just don't understand how you can call this place home.
Where is my old friend MacCready?
Where is Ferris?
How much?
I'd say you're lookin' at about a buck fifty here.
A dollar fifty?
I have that.
Good.
I'm just gonna take a little walk and wrap my brain around this one.
I'm not takin' one for the team, if that's what you're gettin' after.
It's a shame about the new boss, huh?
He just got here and he's already thinking' of quitting'.
Why are you saying that?
That is the posture of a quitting' man.
It's the wrong day for this to be happening, man.
Buster?
We're comin' up the foothill.
I'll take this side of the hill!
Hey, Buster.
Let's just hang out.
Pretend we're at the zoo.
Buster, this is a big gun and I don't want to shoot you.
He's been hit by a powerful tranquillizer!
Way to go, Mr. Mee!
Ben contained him, so he's fine.
You were blessed.
Well, you're the man.
You're the man who just stared down a 750-pound North American grizzly.
It looks like Buster is gonna be okay.
To Benjamin.
I love that you were named after Bob Dylan.
You hear that sound?
Those are lemurs.
They're primates, they sound like people laughing in the distance.
They freak me out.
No, it's gonna be the other way around.
Well, how do you figure that?
I was afraid you thought he was a little bit of a jerk.
I'm guessing that Rosie was more like your wife and Dylan's more like you and that's why you're so hard on him.
I want you to know, I think you're incredibly pretty.
Please, don't take offense if I don't hit on you.
I don't doubt that.
I'll see you tomorrow, right?
It hurts me to tell you this.
I've been checking his bills.
I am warning you now.
Behind that front is a front!
Benjamin Mee is a fraud!
And it led me to that.
Let's go.
She knew exactly what you would do.
You'd make a bad investment, need to start over, and have to have a cushion.
This is your cushion.
She used three exclamation marks.
She loved you.
Well, I can see why you still carry the torch.
Yeah, but with $84,000, we'll cut a few corners, but I know we can make the inspection.
No, Benji.
Listen.
They're gonna have those memories forever.
This money is your ticket out.
And if you won't listen to your brother, the accountant, then listen to your wife who clearly planned a financial future for you.
Here.
Thanks.
I hear you may not be staying here much longer.
Seriously?
But if you still want to be friends, you know, I'll still be your friend.
I mean, there are still cars and all.
Well, yeah, of course, but are you for real with this?
I'm goin' home.
See my friends.
Hey, listen, I gotta go.
You don't have to leave so fast.
Each of you, I've come to know in some small way.
I've been an adventure addict my whole life.
And I just want to say that it's been the best one of all because it's personal.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Our adventure is just beginning.
That's not what I meant.
I know.
I don't speak Spanish.
- All right!
- Almost there, buddy!
It's cold.
I think Spar will like these.
How come you don't tell stories anymore?
Well, because we're livin' the story.
I wish we could tell Mom that.
You don't think Mom knows?
I know she knows.
Me, too.
Okay. $74.39.
I don't come up with the prices.
It's really well worn.
- That's the one.
- You work there?
I do, and I also own it.
Strange but true.
I love that zoo!
Really?
You reserve me nine tickets, 'cause I'm gonna bring the in-laws.
And maybe we could feed a couple of 'em to the tigers.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
You want to hear somethin' crazy?
I think we're gonna be okay.
Come on, man, we talked about this.
You gotta eat that food to get all the meds.
You know, there's a major buzz waiting' for you inside that meat.
Your neurotransmitters are gonna be firin' all the way to the moon and back.
You'll be dating seven-year-olds.
Have every house cat from here to El Cajon.
I'm tellin' you the truth.
Trust me.
Come on, man, we're almost there.
You gotta stick with me.
We got opening day comin' up.
Well, can we use the ladder?
We tried luring him with food.
He's dehydrated.
I mean, we've gotta get him into the enclosure.
Are the other two inside?
- He's slow, I can outrun him.
- It's not a bullfight.
For what?
No, man.
Look, this doesn't feel right.
Benjamin, it never feels right.
Hey, look, I'm feelin' a real lack of privacy right now.
- It's going to happen.
He's better.
It's going to happen.
And I invite you to tell me about that sometime.
I'm saying, we just let him live for a couple more weeks.
Get him some medicine and invest in a little bit of hope!
No, I can't stand by and watch this happen!
It's gonna happen.
Don't make me get angry.
'Cause that would just be so terrible, if you got angry.
You know what the right thing to do is!
I'm so disappointed in you.
Well, you don't even know me well enough to say that!
- No, look, it's fine.
- Good job.
- Thank you.
- Nah, not really.
I guess I just can't talk to girls that well?
The secret to talking is listening.
I thought if I came out here it would stop.
Back home, every place reminded me of her.
I mean, the air, the way it smelled in May and August, because those were the months that her favorite bushes grew flowers all over our neighborhood.
They're all triggers, man.
But the funny thing is that it just turns out that she's here, too.
And seriously, I'm avoiding half the aisles.
Pastries, forget about it.
She loved red kites and blueberry Pop-Tarts.
If only I could talk to her about getting over her.
And none of her lightness.
And that only comes once in a lifetime.
Just can't get a handle on it.
I cannot let go.
I can.
That is bullshit!
With that expression in my eyes?
I heard you!
We could be hobos.
Because you wasted all our money!
Some of that belonged to me, Dad!
I mean, I thought you liked me!
I thought this was a dream come true for us!
It's your dream!
You can't force a dream onto someone else, Dad!
Because it's a good dream!
And it's got cool animals in it and some pretty great people, too!
Do something!
- Help me, damn it!
I'm sorry that your mother got sick when she did.
Believe me.
I'm sorry that you didn't get more of a childhood, man.
That's just how that one went.
But we live with a seven-year-old girl who still believes in the Easter Bunny.
What are we gonna do?
You never ask me how I'm doin'.
You never even taught me how to shave.
What, you want to know how to shave?
I would love to teach you how to shave!
Let's shave!
What about the Easter Bunny?
Is it time?
What happened with you and Lily?
I don't know.
I guess I didn't listen to something she told me or somethin'?
I mean, I liked her.
It's like you embarrass yourself if you say something, and you embarrass yourself if you don't.
I like it when you talk.
You know, sometimes all you need is 20 seconds of insane courage.
Just, literally 20 seconds of just embarrassing bravery.
And I promise you, something great will come of it.
I never know what to say to you.
I'm the same way.
Why don't we just tell each other what we wish the other guy would say?
"I'm sorry I brought you out to the sticks."
"You're a great dad."
You did your best, Dad.
He knows that.
Okay.
You would have done the same for me.
Where are you putting this?
You have three named Peaches.
Would somebody just get my tranq gun?
My brother can't take no for an answer.
Not why I'm here, bro.
I asked him if you guys needed any help.
- For Bruno.
- Buster.
Whatever.
I started questioning my entire being back there on the 405.
- So we do.
Wait.
- Love our logo, she's a beaut.
- Have you been drinking?
- All night long.
- Thanks for that.
I want everyone to stay off their walkies.
All right, here we go.
Here's to us.
It's an adventure now?
Well, to be precise, sir, it always was.
- Hello, MacCready.
- How are you?
- On my best behavior.
I like the jumpsuit.
Wait for me, Dad.
Well, that's one way to do it.
Moist.
Let's go see Solomon's enclosure.
Come, MacCready, please come, please.
I'm gonna distract him from the other side of this enclosure and you're gonna not get eaten!
All right, it's gonna be fine.
- Hey, do you want somethin' to drink?
Do you have any idea what they put in water?
I like to work in silence!
Sheep farts in aspic!
Got it!
Afternoon, Solomon!
I don't know what that means, but I don't believe it.
I don't think it's gonna work.
But good luck.
I don't fraternize, Mr. Mee.
I'm sure I'll have plenty of reports.
So, Ernesto and his friends are plastering posters everywhere within a 20-mile radius.
What happens if literally we did this whole thing for nothing?
We walk with lions.
Good aim.
You do somethin' for the right reasons, nothing can stop you.
Plus, I wasn't named after Bob Dylan.
I was named after a dog named Dylan.
- Sorry about the rain.
The precipitation tonight is just a hint of what's yet to come!
Or better yet, just stay indoors.
Look, my cameraman just handed me his umbrella.
Betsy, we're told that this is gonna be the wettest summer in over 100 years!
On this July 6th, 2010, reports of power lines down as this record storm continues.
Very heavy rain and plenty of lightning continue throughout the week.
Okay, well, we all know that I stink at speeches, so I won't even try.
If Katherine were here, she would have come up with somethin' really funny and clever for me to say, and I'd have taken full credit.
It's not about where an adventure ends, 'cause that's not what an adventure's about.
So anything that happens from here on out is a bonus.
And I love you guys.
It's a zoo!
Yes, it is!
- What time is it?
They should be here.
- No, something's wrong!
The tree fell down in the rain last night!
They couldn't have gotten through even if they were here.
Hey, guys, thanks for coming out and welcome to your zoo.
As you can see, the tigers know that you're here, so they're showing off today.
A couple of interesting facts about the tigers.
Peafowl are very resilient animals.
This is Lucy and Wesley, and Peaches.
And this is Solomon.
- Good job.
- Thank you.
Home Depot.
Well done.
I got a big crush on you, and I just can't get a handle on it, so.
Congratulations.
Congratulations to you.
And if we're standing near each other on New Year's, we'll do this again sometime.
I look forward to New Year's.
Look over here, guys.
If you had to choose between people and animals, really quick, how would you choose?
Me, too.
People!
You goofball.
Do you remember what you told me when I was a kid?
You only have to be courageous for 20 seconds.
It has guided me my entire life.
I love that you're telling stories again.
This is the story before the story.
This is where you and you begin.
Because this is where I met your mom.
She was sitting right there in that chair.
Hang on.
And I saw her and I literally stopped, like this, just stopped.
But I've never done anything like this.
I'd never gone and talked to a total stranger before.
But she was right there.
And so I thought to myself, "20 seconds." Right?
Thinkin' about leaving.
Bravery.
Here's what I said.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mommy.
Why not?
You think you can keep up with me?
Hey, that's my line, Bones.
What do you mean, you won?
I won, and you're buying the coffee.
Heart-shaped superior inlet indicates the victim was male.
Suit was definitely a giveaway for me, Bones.
You know, I'm sorry we didn't make the lecture.
You wanted to hear about what?
Why didn't the shooter take all that money?
He's only interested in the kill.
Plus, it's handmade.
You can never have too many cute phrases for taking a life.
The ID says the victim was Walter Crane.
I bet this is someone we'd both be trying to put away.
It doesn't matter who this was.
Snipers don't get to make the call, and Broadsky doesn't get to make the call.
Why are you pinching your lips shut?
I find that it helps prevent me from blurting.
Uh, cause of death is high-velocity trauma, resulting in the severing of the spinal cord, here.
Identification found on the remains suggests that this is a man named Walter Crane.
Look at the isotope ratios from his bone apatite.
Nitrogen levels suggest a Midwesterner.
I think we need Angela to do a facial reconstruction.
You would like to ascertain that this man is indeed Walter Crane, a construction worker from Virginia.
It appears that these remains and this identity do not correspond.
Hello, sweetness.
Well, if anybody asks, that's exactly what I'm doing.
Let me look at you.
You're one fine, fine woman.
Okay, Dad, what do you want?
Your first-born child.
You know, to a lot of people, that would totally freak them out.
I heard his name in one bad get-down, boogiein' blues number.
The name that I hated so much that I changed it as soon as I could?
It's still your name.
Not legally.
Dad, traditionally, the father of the child does have some say over the name.
Well, I guess if you feel you gotta, then... you gotta.
Yes, blood, of course, blood.
But guess what else I found.
You know who this is?
Dead guy's a counterfeiter.
That makes sense, that Broadsky would go after a counterfeiter.
It sort of comes with a built-in motive for murder attached, doesn't it?
That's why they need protection.
Walter Coolidge.
Doesn't make him right.
Of course it doesn't make him right.
It just bleeds off a little of our motivation to catch him right away.
Coolidge flipped on Ortiz, and sent him to prison.
Ortiz isn't currently in prison because he's sitting in your interrogation room.
You're the best.
Tell me something I don't know.
It's like a field trip, you know?
- Remember him?
Taking your drug-stained small bills and giving them new life as hundred-dollar bills?
I'm offended at the allegation.
I hired Walter as an art consultant.
He testified against you.
I'm in for triple-life.
Seems to me you know who this guy is.
I need to know how you got in touch with him.
Why would I tell you?
I can arrange to have you transferred to a medium-security federal penitentiary.
And if you don't, she'll send you to Angola.
And no Internet, which I suspect is the spicy part of your sex life.
If I ever talked to this guy-- which I never did-- it's because he called me.
And if a target was suggested-- which it never was-- it's because it came from him, not from me.
I understand.
Someone as skilled as your sniper likes to ply his trade, huh?
I wish I knew more, but all I did was answer the phone.
Now, when will I be moving to California?
Why does it make sense to you that Broadsky killed a counterfeiter?
I mean, they're all people who got away with something.
Who cares about his twisted motives?
The question is, how did Broadsky even know where to find Coolidge?
He was supposed to be in Witness Protection.
Okay, not all snipers are the same.
I am not him.
Nothing I said made any such allusion.
And you're okay with that?
I didn't even think about it.
And he's my dad.
He's our dad now.
Who gave you a name that is so terrible you had to change it.
Listen, honey, I would not fight him on this.
Don't you think that we should wait and hear what it is?
I actually have a question for you.
Anyway, Angela's father...
Perhaps some research and reflection...
You are afraid of him.
He is a very sweet man.
He kidnapped Hodgins, and gave him a tattoo while he was unconscious, Angela.
I'm walking.
Listen, I think what Sweets is saying is that you should just give this one up.
I mean, we're gonna love this kid so much that the name isn't gonna matter at all.
I can't find any U.S. marshal who worked on both the Gravedigger case and Broadsky's latest victim.
Yeah, well, anyone with high enough security clearance could definitely access the files.
Wait a second.
Paula Ashwaldt.
Well, nothing in Broadsky's file mentions the Fourth Brigade Combat Team.
Well, it's amazing what the official record doesn't show, especially when it comes to snipers.
Paula Ashwaldt.
See this action?
It got her the Purple Heart.
Her unit came under attack.
He saved their bacon.
How do you know?
'Cause he told me.
That's our girl.
Saved 12 soldiers' lives, including Paula Ashwaldt.
You admire him.
For his actions there, yeah.
Not for what he's doing now.
I got to talk to this Paula Ashwaldt.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Miss Ashwaldt.
I'm afraid there is.
You've been in contact with a Jacob Broadsky?
I-I'm sorry.
I'm not supposed to talk to law enforcement without a supervisor present.
I don't know if that would be a really good idea, 'cause the information you have provided Mr. Broadsky has resulted in the death of at least three people.
But what he's doing now-- he's a murderer.
Please get out of my way.
See this woman?
This is what he did to her.
His target was Taffet, the Gravedigger.
She was a monster, but Jacob promised no one else would be hurt.
He killed someone two days ago.
Oh, God.
Did you ever leave him alone with your computer?
I know you have to take me in, but maybe you could give me time-- one soldier to another-- to do the right thing?
You find anything, anything at all, you call me.
Of course.
Well, she's going through her database right now to see what files might have been tampered with.
We're going to get this guy, and he's not going to keep doing this.
Except I'm the good guy, he isn't.
Well, but you both led a life in which you were paid to take lives.
I admire your certainty, but since good and bad are such subjective concepts, how could you ever be sure you were doing the right thing?
Okay, well, it's not subjective to me.
You think Broadsky's here?
I'm not gonna take any chances, okay?
What are you...?
That wall is very unusual.
Fragmentation along the skull seems to be consistent with some type of explosion.
How did he make this shot?
What kind of rounds did he use?
It's like he was using the deer as target practice.
Paula Ashwaldt just killed herself at her desk.
We found it frozen in the suicide victim's cabin freezer.
I'm confused.
Are we investigating a murder, or preparing lunch for the Palin family?
Booth believes Broadsky was practicing.
Decomposition suggests that this deer was killed approximately 48 hours ago.
Oh, and the deer was killed with a shotgun.
Notice the metal fragments scattered throughout the flesh.
Snipers don't tend to use shotguns, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
What weapon, aside from a shotgun, fired at very close range, could cause this type of fragmentation?
Finding the answer starts with asking the correct question.
Welcome to my home.
Can I get you anything?
Talk about what?
What did you say to make Paula kill herself?
Must have been very mean-spirited.
Funny thing is, so do you.
You never could stand the idea of collateral damage.
Do me a favor.
You either shoot me, or you get the hell out of my house.
You and me both-- we've always been on the same side.
No, you're off the reservation, pal.
You want to do the right thing, you give me that gun, and you let me take you in.
I'll tell you what.
The day I wake up and there are no more bad people that need killing, you're the one I come to.
I'm coming after you, Jacob.
It's my job.
There's something you should consider, Booth.
I really liked her.
And you're the reason she's dead.
So tell me, standing in front of God, which one of us will be judged more harshly?
And here I thought you were a Buddhist.
My conscience is clear.
The guy was holding a gun on me.
He doesn't miss.
Maybe that's what he came there for-- you know, that thing where a killer wants to get caught and punished for his wicked, wicked ways.
Cher, did the man get to you?
Oh, I most definitely do.
Well, you're the one who says that you can't argue with the choices that Broadsky makes on who he's gonna shoot.
Yeah, I can't fault that, but now the man has crossed a line.
That's unforgivable.
He should get lethally injected just for that.
Well, no, look at this.
Oh, it is a bullet.
Yeah, looks like it, although it's big-- .110 caliber minimum.
I mean, any larger and we'd have to call this thing a shell.
How does a single bullet fragment into 154 fragments?
Well, at first I thought that it must have been a ricochet, but look at the tip.
There's no sign of impact.
What's this?
It appears to be the remnants from some kind of circuitry that Vincent dug out of the deer meat.
What if the circuitry is part of the bullet?
I mean, this is a computer chip.
You can program it.
Which suggests you can program the bullet.
Yeah, which means we're looking at something from the future.
Time travel is physically impossible.
Yeah, but so is a bullet that you can program like a computer.
Like we didn't have it bad enough with the old kind.
No, no, come in.
Now, why does Bones question that?
I don't understand what happened to him.
I mean, what gives him the right to make these kind of calls?
Being the cause of someone's death, no matter what the circumstances, leaves a man with a great burden, and people deal with that burden in different ways.
You know, some, some celebrate it.
They relish the power as a way of justifying what they have done.
Others, like Broadsky-- they justify another way.
They feel that it's their destiny to mete out justice.
They convince themselves that they have the moral high ground to make these calls.
It's the only way they can live with what they've done.
What about me?
From my perspective, you're a healthy man.
You can accept what you've done and the pain and sadness and regret that comes with it.
You know, not everybody has the strength to deal with that reality.
It's a testament to you that you've built this life with family and friends who love and respect you.
Booth, that can't be easy.
It kills me that Bones thinks that taking someone's life means nothing to me.
You got to get back to work and then I have to get back to work, too, all right?
If you need me again, Booth...
Thanks, really, I got what I needed.
Okay, so I got this demo from the Department of Defense.
More like a bomb.
Well, essentially it is.
It matches the damage to the deer's skull.
The rifle is an AM-40.
You set the distance you want the bullet to detonate.
I'm sorry, why would anyone want a bullet to explode in midair?
Well, here's why.
The rifle is perfect for fighting insurgents in Afghanistan.
That's how he managed the impossible shot on the practice range and why he built walls in the middle of a field.
This bullet has a diameter of 25 millimeters.
The diameter of the bullet we recovered is 20 millimeters.
And the circuitry we found was custom-made.
You mean Broadsky made the weapon himself?
Booth says it's too sophisticated, even for Broadsky.
So, about the baby's name...
Right, it came to me during a song.
Can't be more perfect than that, can it?
I'm sure it must be very meaningful... for you.
Well, that's probably good enough.
So the name that came to you?
Staccato Mamba.
You want to know what it means?
No, no, that's okay because it's not going to happen.
Now, look, you can, you can attack me with dogs, okay, you can burn me with a branding iron, hell, you can make me listen to a musical.
I don't care, but we are not naming our child Staccato Mamba.
You know what you're doing here, right?
You have a child named Staccato Mamba.
We'll have Michael Joseph, if it's a boy or Katherine Temperance if it's a girl.
Michael or Katherine?
That's right.
Michael or Katherine.
I-I'll be going... for now.
Seeley here assures me you're the sweetest, most considerate arms dealer he has ever met.
Actually, I'm more of an arms maker.
Oh, and did you make a smart bullet prototype for Jacob Broadsky?
In my line of work, discretion is paramount.
Discretion can also be an accessory to murder.
I know my law, Seeley.
I can't be charged for simply selling ammunition.
Well, you see, cher, I am the law and I can charge your scrawny ass with whatever I want.
I like the challenge.
I'm a patriot.
Do you remember when you and Jacob were first deployed to Iraq and the army didn't have enough body armor for its soldiers?
The Kevlar vest I made you-- how many rounds did that absorb?
We're not talking about that now.
I believe it was three.
Thank you card would have been nice.
Problem is, Broadsky's not active military.
Well, he's on loan out for a special assignment.
He probably could have shown you phony passports, too.
You'd accept anything that could make you a little money.
Now it's a crime to be a capitalist in America?
He's killed three people so far, three.
I don't see anything.
Must have something in my eye.
You give me something on Broadsky or I swear I will make your life a living hell.
And I'll put you out of business.
You'll be recycling Kalashnikovs in a hut in Sudan.
I don't know where he is.
Draw.
It was going to be used in a rectangular room, 30 feet long by 18 feet.
It has marble paneling and a marble floor and a ceiling-- 12 feet high, made of copper.
Wait a minute.
I know where it is.
You do?
It's the women's bathroom in the federal courthouse.
Well, I'm sure there are other...
Yep, that's the one.
It fits the measurements exactly.
You know, he's going to wait for another chance.
We just got to figure out the who.
I've got the courthouse, and I entered the elevation and distance of Broadsky's practice shot.
The computer is looking for it now.
It's a rooftop at Riggs and 18th.
I want to ask you a question, but I find it makes me anxious.
Here's my question.
Are you doing this so you can kill Broadsky or because it's the best way to stop him?
The answer's still no, and tell her to stop asking.
Booth says, "stop asking."
Waiting makes my teeth hurt.
Nothing.
Maybe we're in the wrong place.
Or the wrong time.
Maybe Angela got it wrong.
Or Broadsky saw us?
No, I doubt that.
Well, the courtrooms are both clear now.
Nothing here except for a few lawyers, and bailiffs, like that.
The courtrooms are clear now.
No female defendants.
Any high-profile cases?
Did she set some psycho free?
This is the first case she's handling alone.
She's no one important.
Who is she defending?
I mean, what did he do?
Who is she defending?
Charged with bribery, accessory to murder.
Looks to me like he's looking to plead out.
Ooh, a bad cop named Allen, bribery and murder charges.
Can we just put her on speaker phone?
What's the story?
Says here he took a bribe not to arrest a hit and run driver who killed a woman and two kids.
That sounds like Broadsky's target.
The men's bathroom looks just like the women's bathroom.
Caroline, the target is the men's bathroom.
We're going to the other side of the building.
There he is.
I got Broadsky.
He's definitely going after the cop.
I'm going to need you to be my spotter.
Okay, the bad cop is on the move, heading toward the bathroom.
I estimate five miles per hour, coming from the south.
Bogey is in the can.
I repeat, Bogey is in the can.
22705, requesting assistance.
Look, I need a ten-block perimeter for a murder suspect.
Same old, same old.
Celebratory tequila.
It don't sit well with you, boy.
Gratitude?
You like that I stood up to you.
You don't seem to be doing any kind of standing up at the moment.
That eventually, you will get him.
Why are you angry at me?
You... are good.
Thanks for standing there, Bones.
I'm standing right beside you, Booth.
Like always.
That's funny, because you made a joke based on relative position, which goes back thematically to our discussion of situational morality.
Okay, going down the checklist:
Now enlevez le ballast!
Commencing aerial inspection of the plant.
Unflattering graffito neutralized.
Hey, Mr. Burns needs our help!
Let's just shoot at him and see what happens.
Hey, where'd it go?
Oh, I can't do it.
Looks like it's up to me.
Let's see, target at two o'clock.
Adjust for wind.
Just shoot already.
But I haven't finished my rituals yet.
That's just sick.
You stink!
Anything, just name it.
All your money and all your stuff.
Lower and likelier.
Uh, Super Bowl tickets?
Playoff tickets?
Regular season, bobblehead day?
Nothing-head day!
It's so fancy:
They, even have a day spa staffed by former All-Pro linemen.
You know, I wouldn't have to do this if I hadn't bought a Ferrari a day for 22 seasons.
Flip over.
I once hosted Saturday Night Live.
Ooh, they even have a zoo... featuring all the NFL mascots.
This place even has its own arts district with football-hating intellectuals!
Homer, the game is right here.
Oh, that's right!
I hope you kids are enjoying yourself today because you and your children will be paying for this place long after the team moves to another city.
Ooh, the Fan Cam!
Aw, come on, sourpuss.
Has the Joker taught you nothing?
Dad, this isn't funny!
The child has wetted his trousers!
Dad, how could you do that?
The whole audience saw me pee my pants!
Son, I'm really, really sorry.
Taking pity on the boy, the operators of Springfield Stadium opened the stadium's retractable roof in an attempt to dry his pants.
Unfortunately, the stain was picked up by Russian spy satellites, and President Dmitry Medvedev has taken the pants-wetting as a sign of American weakness.
And I wouldn't blame him.
You've destroyed our son's self-esteem.
I'm on a European vacation, but "you're a-peein'" everywhere!
You can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
You know that.
That's great!
Then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalog and find one.
Here's one right here.
Please, Marge, no.
The other negligent dads will make fun of me.
They're so cliquey.
You'll be fine.
You always are.
Oh, I miss my friends from drunk driving school.
They were so cool.
Homer, welcome to Fresh Start, a fathering enrichment class.
My name is Dr. Zander.
Last week we assigned everyone to keep a fathering journal.
Gerald, would you like to share your entries?
Absolutely, Dr. Zander.
Uh, Homer, it says here you've been a father for ten years.
What has that taught you?
Well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father.
But... oh, you know, the other day, Bart, the little dickens, said I had an elephant butt.
Yeah, strangling.
I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but... it's the sharpest.
Right?
Anyway, I said "Bart..."
You're actually serious?
You physically lay your hands on your boy's neck?
Look at these grades!
They're a disgrace!
No TV for a week!
Why, you little...
So, are those butter cookies for everybody, or.?
Um... why don't we stop there for today, and I'll see you next week.
Who do you have next period?
Where is everybody?
I told them not to come.
Why didn't you tell me not to come?
I feel... in this situation, the only option is a risky and radical treatment.
Homer, meet Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
I had 86 assists.
But today he's here to assist me with you.
Homer, it's time you understood what it feels like to be young, small and terrified.
No, Doc, please.
I'm just a little boy.
Why, you little...
I don't want to hurt him, Doc.
You have a good heart, Kareem.
Which is why you're the only Laker I could trust with this task.
Hey, Kareem, what do you think about today's selfish players?
I believe we've made excellent progress here today, and after another few years of twice-weekly sessions, we can really...
I want you to know I'm cured.
What I am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
Go ahead, just try to provoke me.
I just got up, man.
Fine.
Why, you little...!
I'll teach you to...
I'm in your head, man.
Maybe this time...
All right.
Why, you little...!
He'd say, "I'm a grown man who's scared of my own son."
Look.
How many more, sir?
Fill the board, then wash my car.
These are my keys.
What was that?
You think you're better than the Great Simpsini?
Well, you're not.
What are you gonna do, write a book about me?
You couldn't get in the door of Random House if your name was Bennett Cerf III.
One, two, three, cry.
One, two, three, cry.
Precious, is that you?
You think you're so pretty.
Where's my lotto ticket?
I forgot, Mama.
And don't you come back without it!
I don't see many more movie roles for a girl like you.
Not unless George Lucas needs another Death Star.
The school called and said Bart is out of control.
I think we may need some therapy for him.
Dr. Zander?
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
Anyone?
Dr. Zander, what happened?
So, we all live here now, along with the other unemployed luxury professionals:
wedding planners, personal shoppers, aromatherapists, high-end caterers.
Well, I'll pass that on to the chef.
I'll also pass on pieces of your face to my monkeys.
Look, now my son needs your help.
How much you got on you?
Uh... $23.
And there's a can of beans in my car.
Probably, but we should discuss it in your car.
The sommeliers are coming.
Great year for Zin.
This is what I drink at home.
Homer, Bart, this weekend in the wilderness should repair the shattered bond between the two of you.
I find that in a natural setting...
Very funny, Bart.
That's not the snake, is it?
Sorry, little friend.
Slither back to your natural element.
Now, Bart, I want you to guide your father safely through these cacti.
Then what do we win?
Three steps right.
Two to the right.
We'll do each other's nails, make some brownie sundaes and watch the four saddest horse movies I could find.
Really?
Can I see it?
Oh, I always forget about this part.
Homer, desperate times call for desperate measures.
I don't know.
Keep your neck inside the rope at all times!
As you all can see, I.M.A. Wiener.
I see it, Moe.
Bart, I'm trying to get you to feel something for your father!
I feel something for him.
We'll talk when he's dead!
Thanks, Dad.
Son, you and I are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist.
Sue me for what?
My home in a hollowed-out tree?
Pretty sweet, eh, boy?
You know, I was skeptical, but I guess therapy works.
Five years ago, he was our top agent.
Does it have to be him?
He's the only one our contact will talk to.
So where is he?
This will take time.
Mind must be master of the body.
Strong mind can separate the body from its suffering.
Good concentration, English.
When mind is master of the body, you will be warrior once more.
Master, what is my destiny?
I'm in touch with a higher power.
MI7 wants you on the first flight back to London
Master, am I ready?
Window seat or aisle?
Look into the camera.
Don't smile.
Pamela Thornton, Head of Ml?
Johnny English.
Have a seat.
People here often talk about your adventures in Mozambique.
Frankly, I didn't want to see you back.
You are everything I came into this service to change.
But my hands are tied.
And there are times when one has to go against one's better judgement.
We have a situation.
Indeed.
I'm very much atone with the animal kingdom.
We're all lovely.
Kate Sumner, our behavioural psychologist.
I've heard a great deal about you.
Glowing reports, I trust.
Tell me, Ms Sumner, what exactly does a behavioural psychologist do?
Monitor observable behaviour for signs of internal psychology.
We read people.
So, Pegasus, this situation.
Ex-CIA agent Titus Fisher has contacted us from Hong Kong.
He has intelligence of a plot to assassinate the Chinese Premier at the Anglo-Chinese talks next week.
We need you to go and find out what he's got.
Well, in that case, Pegasus, count me in.
Agent One will meet you downstairs.
Simon.
Hello, Johnny!
Come on, let's get you sorted.
Welcome to the toy cupboard.
I won't leave you my number.
You know Patch.
Patch Quartermain, the man himself.
Please, don't get up.
No chance of that.
Lost them testing the B-6 exploding brogues.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
How are you?
Have to be this one, I'm afraid.
Lost this to the D-10 doorbell.
Don't!
Would you stop meddling, English?
Here she is.
Voice activation recognises only you.
Keep up!
Here's what you'll be taking to Hong Kong.
That's the new P-two digital dart gun.
We do love it when you get strict, Pegasus.
English, you go to Hong Kong tonight.
Fisher will contact you there.
Agent Tucker.
It will be an honour, sir.
Well, it'll be good to have somebody to carry the bags.
Crystal clear, Pegasus.
Just like old times, eh, Johnny?
There's nothing I'd like more, Simon.
Has anyone seen the voice-changing travel lozenges?
Come on, Tucker.
Ten thousand dollars' worth, please, my lovely.
And a receipt, please.
Be alert for contact, Tucker.
We're looking for a Chinese man in spectacles.
Sir, the Chinese man in spectacles.
Contact.
Evening.
Your grandmother is sick.
Your grandmother is sick.
Is he dead, sir?
Yes.
I felt a bit funny last night, but I'm okay now.
So, what have you got for us?
Come on, Fisher, I need names, I need evidence!
Vortex has a secret weapon.
This is one of three keys that, when used together, gain access to it.
Without this, Vortex is finished
How did you get hold of it?
It's mine.
Come off it, Fisher
You, a hired assassin?
You couldn't hit a barn door with a banana
And as for Vortex, clearly you got the name off a box of washing powder.
Vortex was in Mozambique.
Sir, there's a...
Get after her, Tucker, get after her!
Over here, Tucker!
I lost her, sir.
Look what I found.
Hand it over, chimp.
Right-0, Wing Commander.
How exciting!
We've got vodka, rum.
Your safety is our priority.
Créme de menthe, a smidgen of port, and that's about it, I'm afraid.
I'm Shirley.
I say, Wing Commander!
More champagne, my lovely.
Certainly, sir.
Tucker' are you sure you don't want a Shandy or something?
I have got to finish this mission report, sir.
And Pegasus wants to see us as soon as we touchdown.
The mission report?
You should learn to savour success.
Vortex is finished
But better still, for years I believed what happened in Mozambique was my fault.
What did happen in Mozambique?
Certainly.
Sir, I don't think he's a "Susan."
But then you're not a linguist, are you, Tucker'?
It's not "Susan," it's "Shoooshan."
From the Xinzhou region, unless I'm very much mistaken.
The Prime Minister is extremely concerned.
He has every reason to be so.
Good Lord.
The danger, however, has been averted.
Now that we have this.
- Now, I know what you're going to say, it's a pretty small object
Well, it's often the little things that pack the biggest punch.
The mighty Vortex has been slain by my possession of this small key.
We got it, but Fisher talked.
You've got some more cleaning to do.
Perhaps when you've found your key, you'll give me a call.
Oh, God.
She was in Hong Kong!
Couldn't she be both?
Mummy, Mummy, are you all right?
Let me get you a cup of tea.
Yeah, I think a cup of tea, that's what's required.
Pegasus, I am truly, truly sorry.
I cannot apologise enough, Mrs Pegasus.
It was a simple case of mistaken identity, I'm afraid.
Now, I completely understand how upset you are, but I was hoping perhaps...
You murderous crone!
I've got her this time, Pegasus!
This is the witch who works for Vortex!
Want any more' you old hag?
You humiliate me in front of the Foreign Secretary, you lose our only lead on Vortex, and then you try and kill my mother!
Twice!
Well, you certainly gave Mr Rhubarb a run for his money.
Still, at least we know Vortex was in Mozambique.
When you told Pegasus, you displayed all four indicators of someone telling the truth.
I want to take you back to Mozambique.
Is that really necessary?
Take a look at this.
I want to take you back to Mozambique.
If Vortex was in Mozambique, perhaps you saw something.
I'm going to take you back there using hypnosis.
I'm not going to just snap my fingers and make you say the first thing that comes into your head.
Plump pillows.
Excuse me?
Incredible.
And completely out of my league.
I'd like to take you back to Mozambique.
President Chambal's inauguration day.
Yes, you're head of security.
Everything's going perfectly.
Agent English.
Do you know how to turn it on?
I should be getting back.
The President couldn't be in safer hands.
The fireworks have begun.
Who can you see?
Who can you see, Johnny?
Artem Karlenko.
Retired after his penchant for killing people threatened his cover.
Five years ago, he turned up here as Sergei Pudovkin.
Rich, very rich.
A member of the exclusive Oakwood Golf Club, which is where you'll be meeting him.
He's in a match play competition, sir.
I'm making you his opponent for the day.
Thank you, Tucker.
Mr Pussykin?
Pudovkin.
Beautiful car, Mr Adams.
Ah, the Royce.
Thank you.
Shall we?
Let's go.
Command accepted.
So, what line of business are you in, Mr Adams?
Sorry, I thought I had forgotten something.
Glove, sir'?
I may not know much about golf, Tucker, but I know how to hold the bat.
Shot, sir.
So, what line of business are you in, Mr Puddykin?
I'll bear that in mind, Mr Puddykin.
Shot!
Just a key
In the trees.
He's not looking good, sir.
You do know how to fly these, sir?
It's just like riding a bike.
This is helicopter Golf Hotel Zulu Zulu Tango.
She shot out the navigation system.
About 18 inches.
The second key.
There's a mole in MI7.
But what you're saying is there might be a mole as well.
Pegasus.
There's a meeting at MI7 with the Prime Minister.
And here again, eyes down and to the left, indicating dissent.
Yes, Prime Minister.
I'm the Prime Minister.
Yeah, you wish.
These talks with China are of paramount importance.
Traditionally, China has been impervious to our concerns, but I believe Xiang Ping, given the opportunity, can and will help defuse this situation.
Well, with his pro-West stance, it certainly offers an opportunity, but the talks can't go ahead unless we can guarantee his safety.
I believe, with the correct security, that we can.
If Vortex is operational it's just too dangerous
I'm inclined to agree, Prime Minister.
There is a way.
The Swiss are willing to lend us Le Bastion.
That's their government fortress in the Alps.
It's a stunning example of architectural engineering at altitude, and completely impregnable.
I mean, that should solve all our security issues.
Where are we on Vortex?
Karlenko was killed today on the orders of the third.
Any leads?
Yes, but I need time.
We do not have time.
We need to know the identity of the third person in Vortex.
Give me 24 hours.
And bring two spoons.
So, come on, Johnny, what was it you wanted to ask me'?
Simon, do you know what this is?
Some sort of key?
Karlenko and Fisher both had one, and they were both killed for them.
Well, I'll give it to the boys at the lab and see...
Karlenko told me that the third man in Vortex is in MI7.
And you believed him?
Simon, I have to ask you a question, face to face.
Do you have any idea who it might be?
- Simon Ambrose, the evil mastermind!
Simon, you are so funny.
Would you excuse me for one moment, Simon?
Sir, it's Ambrose.
Simon Ambrose?
He went to Eton.
Then how do you explain these?
Sometimes I have trouble myself, old boy.
Tucker, this is ridiculous.
Sorry, I'll be with you in just a tick.
I was there because of Patch Quartermain.
Patch?
Sorry, I'll just be one second.
He's the man you're after.
I work for a secret organisation inside MI7 set up specifically to bring him in.
What's it called?
Armitage.
A secret secret secret service called Armitage?
We answer only to the PM.
It's extraordinary, Simon...
Indeed, it is.
...That you'd think for one moment that I would fall for such a steaming pile of old baloney.
You've let me down, you've let the Service down and, frankly, I think you've let yourself down.
He thinks you're a moron with no place in MI7, a jumped-up grammar school nobody That's why he tried to destroy you.
Now, Johnny, just because he ruined your life, that's no reason for you to go rogue and take him down on your own.
God forbid I should put a crazy idea like that in your head.
Good night, Simon.
It's Johnny English.
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Patch?
After all, I'm just a jumped-up grammar school nobody, aren't I?
What are you talking about?
I know that you are the third man in Vortex.
No, you are.
Standby, all agents.
And it all ends here.
Take him.
Gotcha.
You must believe me.
How will it be done?
Who have you chosen?
Leave that with me.
You've been out for hours
Well, you're lucky it was just a flesh wound.
Now, look, I'm going to Switzerland tonight, but you can stay here while I'm gone.
I've been going through the news footage from the night Chambal was killed.
And there's something not right.
Seconds after President Chambal was shot, the assassin collapses and dies.
And the autopsy says heart failure.
But, if you go through the classified CCTV footage...
You all right?
Yeah, fine.
Take a look at this.
Fifteen minutes before the assassination, look, he's manic.
Someone was talking to him.
I don't think he had any idea what he was doing.
And only one fits the symptoms.
Timoxeline Barbebutenol.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'd love a take-away.
Consider it done.
Flying low.
So, Johnny, what are you going to do about Vortex'?
Why do you think he's better than you?
Well, the man's a god.
Well, I prefer mortals.
Pure, complicated, maddening mortals.
I've come to realise that what's really exciting to me is great loyalty, determination, and courage.
You have always fascinated me, clinically.
But now you...
Ms Sumner, your pupils are dilating.
Are they?
Your cheeks are colouring.
Eye contact deepening.
Heart-rate rising.
Ms Sumner, I believe we're emotionally leaking.
Now!
I'll drive you to the airport.
Been working?
There's some questions we want to ask him, about Vortex.
Not hiding him away?
Ambrose.
There's a Mr Adams to see you, Colin.
Every agent in the country is after you.
We were right about Ambrose
What do you mean "we"?
And if we can act fast, we can still...
You wouldn't listen, would you?
And, thanks to you, I'm suspended!
Would you boys like some orange squash?
I am here because my country needs me.
And because it needs you, too.
Come.
Obstruction detected.
Set the sat nav for Switzerland Let's kick some bottom.
Good luck, sir!
That's a D-7 bulletproof shield.
The P-8 grapple hook?
Check.
Well, go on.
The D-16 ascender, and up we go.
Are you sure that's the ascender, sir?
Yes, yes, I'd know it anywhere.
Intruders in Sector Four!
Dear God, let me not die at the hands of the Swiss.
Come on, harder.
I can see how people get a taste for this.
I got a better idea.
Agent Tucker!
It's Johnny English.
Bag him.
Excellent.
You ready, Slater'?
I'll have them send refreshments to your room when you're ready, Pegasus.
Thank you, Agent One.
I'll take it from here, boys.
Hold it right there!
Let me see your ID.
- Excuse me
Warning, this is a designated conflict zone.
What the hell is that?
Agent One, thank God.
To give you a drug that will make you obey his every command.
By injection?
Some hideous gas through the air vents?
Or by spiking her drink?
Timoxeline Barbebutenol.
He'll enter the manic phase any moment now.
I have to warn you that I've been trained to resist this kind of thing.
Agent One, what's going on?
He's quite harmless at this phase.
The drug will kill him, but just before it does, there'll be a short window where he'll do everything I tell him to.
Poor Johnny.
Now you're about to become our most famous agent.
You'll now do exactly as I tell you.
You are a traitor to the Service and to your country.
Shut her up, old chap.
I warned you.
Ready.
Premier Ping, it's a pleasure to finally meet you.
You had a pleasant flight, I trust?
Isn't it great?
Lock it up, Johnny.
That's it.
Premier, I am most grateful you have agreed to meet me at this time.
I can assure you that the Chinese people have always regarded the British people as completely horrible.
Completely honourable.
Of course.
I was very keen to meet...
Johnny, stand up and go to the water table.
Premier, I believe the present danger can be averted if we act swiftly.
Go to your right pocket.
We designed it for Pegasus.
Well, it's too bloody late now.
Just act natural.
Now, Johnny, I want you to kill Xiang Ping.
Oh, dear God, no.
He's being controlled.
By who?
Shoot Xiang Ping!
Mind must be master of the body.
He's resisting it.
His left hand is fighting the right hand.
Come on, Johnny.
English, stand up!
He'll be dead in 50 seconds, sir.
Listen to me, this is Simon Ambrose, and I order you to shoot Xiang Ping!
Ten seconds, sir.
Fire!
Hold your fire!
Stand down!
His pulse is dropping.
Don't lose him!
Open your head, English, and you shall be reborn.
Almost there.
Thank you, Kate.
I was passing.
Welcome back, sir.
Where's Ambrose?
Ambrose' you five-star turd.
Another balls-up, Johnny.
What's the matter with you?
It's all over, Ambrose.
You can betray your country, you can cheat your friends, but you can't get away from Johnny English...
So long, Johnny!
Tucker, you clever boy.
We owe English a great deal.
Well, reinstating his knighthood is a truly lovely gesture.
And it will mean the world to him.
Her Majesty will be with him shortly.
You never know when it's over, do you?
Well, it's over, over, over, over, over!
Think about Karen and think about Becca.
You OK, baby?
Fuck, the rabbit done died.
We could actually use a lead guitarist.
- What do you guys call yourselves?
- Queens Of Dogtown.
That doesn't mean I don't want one or more of your fingers in my vagina right now.
Why you got to talk to me like that?
Mornin', sassafras!
What do you think?
Like a statutory rapist in a suit.
Man, you are on fire this morning!
The wit is strong in you, young Skywalker.
- You know, Ben Harper.
That van-sized, caramel-coloured man you've been hanging around with.
None of your business.
Kind of like a young Lando Calrissian, with a dream.
Hey, sweetie.
- Well, what do you think of your old man?
- You know what they say.
You can't polish a turd.
Did he have any idea how old you were?
- Did he ever ask?
Is it true that you punched him in the face during intercourse?
Why?
I... wanted him to remember me.
- You know what this means, right?
I like it when you say "imminently." It gets me a little hard.
- Good to know.
- Sorry, I have a dinner tonight.
I see why you sleep with teenagers - you are one.
- Now you have to have dinner with me.
- Why, because I adjusted the truth?
Who is probably very handsome, very fit, and very fuckin' boring.
- Does this shit really work for you, Hank?
Yes, you are special, all right.
The issue of your bill.
I think I need some money, Charlie.
You want me to get you a quickie dialogue polish or something?
You know, I was thinking about one of those Twilight films.
They seem very popular, and desperately in need of word polishing.
I will make some calls, see what I can do.
Where's your cock?
- And there's my answer.
Send it off to the poor kids in China or something.
So you think I should, what, take it all off?
- About your newfound affinity for milk chocolate?
Are you crazy?
- Wouldn't you just like to know?
I don't really give a fuck, Charlie.
- I'm just making conversation.
She is really very pretty.
Which is good because she left some serious stank in that bathroom, Karen.
- I almost fainted.
- Wow, talk about a cute meet.
How rich we talkin' here?
He's supposed to have some legendary schvantz.
Must be nice.
- What?
Come here.
There's nothing vague about it, that's the good news.
- I'm having drinks with Sasha Bingham.
She's gonna pick my brain.
Sure there's enough to go around?
Well, as much as anyone can know these actor peoples.
- Who, by the way, you already fucked.
- Shut up with that already.
I feel like I'm under a wet, warm blanket.
- That does not sound very appealing.
- You should stay and have a drink with us.
Missed you.
Here we go.
Not so bad.
I need to get in there, Charlie!
This is why I don't like to come here.
You gotta look!
I don't gotta do anything, especially when it's disgusting.
It would pretty much have to be a life or death situation, Charlie.
He's bleeding on the floor.
Jesus fucking Christ, Charlie, we're in escrow, and you're bleeding all over my fucking floor?
Your fucking floor?
This is my fucking floor too, and I'll bleed on it if I want to!
Holy Jesus, woman, I'm in dire straits here!
What's every shitty first novel about?
Nothing and everything.
I'd read that book, sister.
Fuck, I wrote that book, like, four times before I actually ever published anything.
- That's just my métier.
- Well, your métier was my epic failure.
How is it that your happily ever after doesn't remotely involve a dude?
You're like a... sexy gummi bear... but with caramel on the inside.
Like a gummi bear wrapped around some other kind of sweet goodness.
But to answer your question... dudes have a very hard time with a woman who's addicted to her profession.
- Maybe you just haven't met the right dude.
Because all I ever see is an impediment to getting my work done.
Doesn't stop me from having sex with who I want, when I want.
OK, I'm less sad now.
- Let's play a little game.
You're right, that is a boner killer.
- We're a lot alike, you and me.
- I do like where this is going.
- That's what the writing's for.
- First time I've heard that.
Let me guess, a message from behind the white picket fence?
Not a smirk, a smile.
- Consider yourself lucky that I asked you at all.
- Don't be that guy?
- Don't be the guy who makes this shit any weirder than it has to be, all right?
- You'll let me have that one?
- Yeah, I will.
This is my dad.
I thought you said he was out of the picture.
Hey, Hank, we're gonna take these two little rock stars out to get something to eat.
A little post-gig celebration.
It's like holding hands with a merman.
What's with all the scarring down here?
Your scrotum feels like a relief map.
I was a young agent on a budget.
I told you not to skimp on that shit!
- Know what the other dick docs call him?
So what exactly are you saying here, Doc?
Not that he's gonna have an erection anytime soon.
No, thank you.
- She's really fucked up, Hank.
I can't wait to play her.
Hey, what's up, Mama Mia?
Mind if I join you... on the ledge?
Come on, you're always good for a laugh or two.
Bet you didn't know I was afraid of heights, did you?
You never struck me as scared of anything.
You know what really terrifies the shit out of me?
Yeah, I can't eat waffles or pancakes for fear of getting that nasty shit all over my hands.
Croissant too.
It's the texture, something about the...
I like that in a girl.
I was thinking about it, you know.
But somehow I don't think it's the right ending for either one of us, Mia.
Well, so where do we go from here, then?
Depends on where you want to go, Mia.
- Go back to being a kid.
It was the year that changed my life.
You know what we need to do, Mia...
What do you think?
Deal?
I'm not kidding.
Take a nap.
Previously on Californication...
We could actually use a lead guitarist.
- What do you call yourselves?
I've had a couple of vasectomies.
What exactly are you saying here, doc?
There still could be swimmers in his junk?
How about you rewrite the script that I loathe?
With Sasha's interest, we could be at Sundance this time next year.
I'm trying to make the character a little more likeable, cos on the page he's an asshole.
You understand that you are kinda talking about me.
I gotta get it up to 100.
I'm makin' my move.
I'm dropping out.
OK, so... no movie.
What's the good news?
The good news is that I still wanna have sex with you.
At least once more.
You know, that is pretty good news.
Does this mean what I think it means?
I'm wearing one right now, as a matter of fact.
Well, that makes sense.
What makes you think that one Hank Moody has any interest in doing such a thing?
They got 100 grand to spend for one week's work.
A hundy large?
Let me guess.
She's asking for you.
You don't get paid.
If I had it already, you'd be second-guessing me from down here instead of up there.
Hank, can you pitch me a bunch of alts for this scene?
I don't think my character would say this shit.
First of all, who says it's your fucking character?
And secondly, I don't give a fuck.
I'm still a little sore from this morning's playdate.
Pussy.
You know, I'm a writer, Sasha, not a fuck toy.
You can write your own stuff.
Fuck.
- I gotta go deal with her.
You're bought and paid for, Moody.
Get your freak on, Officer.
You know, Bex, you're really making me regret ever signing you up for guitar lessons.
I only ever did it because you wanted me to.
Yeah, I'm just trying to make you feel bad.
- Becca...
I don't like how things are changing.
I'll always be your father.
No duh, Dad.
But what the fuck does that mean?
And you know what really scares me?
Now more than ever.
Is that a kid thing... or a genetic thing?
I mean, it's not like I haven't done this before, twi... once.
In college.
Well, I mean, that's exciting.
- Yeah, because you'll judge me.
That's ridiculous.
I've been judging you for years.
Marcy, I don't think everyone is here to have an abortion.
You never know, Karen.
Just because we have a black president, doesn't mean we talk about that shit.
- She looks so happy.
Just because she doesn't know what's ahead of her.
I think you need to face the fact that there's a part of you that wants to have a baby.
Look at you.
You're such a regular, you just walk on in, they slide your drink, no questions asked?
Bad day?
Medium shitty, yeah.
I hear that.
No stranger to misery, are you?
I like that in a woman sitting alone at a bar.
Tell me all your troubles.
- I got some of that shit too.
Word.
Well, here's to... difficult daughters.
Cheers, cheers.
- Good evening.
Well, I'm not sure she will any more.
- Why's that?
- Of course they couldn't.
You were watching pornography, weren't you?
- Some other time, OK?
- I just wanna feel something!
Pretend my father could walk in at any second.
- But this is my house.
Oh, no, I wanna stop, but I can't!
Your big black cock feels so good!
Daddy, no!
I'm a big girl now.
- Is he still here?
- No, he went to get his gun.
He's gonna kill both of us, Charlie.
Daddy doesn't like it when I fuck the slaves.
God, that was fucking intense.
I mean, aside from the fact that you're like seven different kinds of naked right now.
Do you know how long it's been since a guy has said that to me?
You really know how to piss all over a girl's happy buzz.
That's very good for you.
But I am leaving for New York in a couple days.
I didn't mean to suggest that we had a future or anything.
That thing is bullet-proof.
That is an ass wrapped in Kevlar.
Your ass is welcome.
A little bit of fun it was.
What does she do?
- Yeah, but like... how many?
- I'm not some big fucking slut, Hank.
I'm gonna give you my notes, then I have to go meet my mother for breakfast.
She comes in every once in a while to check on me and make sure I'm grounded.
Your mom.
Are you having a stroke?
- You fucked my mom?
How do you know my daughter?
- I'm kinda writing something for her.
Especially when you've already been with the awesome dude your mom just boned.
- No, you're lying now, because you did.
You misunderstood.
I was merely talking about writers and actresses, and Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller, and how that shit never seems to work out.
She's a fucking kid!
You fucked my fucking kid.
That's not very age-appropriate, now is it, you asshole?
Settle down, Alfred Bitchcock.
If it's any consolation, your mother smacked me upside the head pretty good.
And my balls are killing me.
- I'm just grossed out right now.
- Well, that's pretty normal.
How would you know?
I once bumped uglies with my daughter's boyfriend's mother.
This too shall pass.
- Do you know what the worst part is?
I was really starting to like you.
Better than Eddie Nero?
- Weird?
- Oddly, no, but I'm really good at compartmentalising shit.
You are one dirty cop.
This is a fine how-do-you-do.
I mean, if you're gonna do it, just do it.
I'm a man.
It's just you're so quiet, and that is weird.
I mean, usually you're yakking up a storm and I've become quite fond of that obscene verbal diarrhoea.
I wasn't planning on breaking up with you, Stu.
Not any time soon, anyway.
Well, I'm guessing you're not moving in with me.
Look, man, we could talk about the "shacking up" shit later, OK?
But I do have to be honest with you.
- It's my penis, isn't it?
I'm pregnant.
- But there is just... other things.
It's mother!
What am I gonna tell her?
Talk about the goddamn Christmas miracle!
Fucking kids.
- They're just a terrible burden, aren't they?
What the fuck are we supposed to do?
You know, it's funny.
It doesn't matter how rich, how famous, they're all just little kids who need their mommies and their daddies.
Here's hoping.
And I know I don't really know you that well, so... this might be out of line, but I'm gonna say it anyway.
What does that mean?
What if it's already too late?
Yes, ma'am.
Notification from Fleet Command.
Change of assignment.
Carry on.
We're heading for the East Sea to monitor the North Korean activity off the coast.
Aye, aye, sir.
Where's the commander?
Is there a problem, Mr. Howard?
I just found him, sir.
As you know, Director, your team is long overdue for their mandatory psych evaluations.
I'm aware that they've been rescheduled.
Nine times, to be specific.
And I spoke to your in-house psych service unit-- no time for them either.
Oh, cases take priority.
Some would say that's-- I don't know-- shortsighted.
Well, the victims' families wouldn't.
Agents need to be at the top of their game.
And my agents always are.
Agent Gibbs resigned at one point.
Agents DiNozzo and McGee were held captive.
They were rescuing Agent David.
Did they receive posttraumatic treatment?
Initial assessments were conducted, and they were all deemed fit for duty.
Optimistic, but doubtful.
My colleagues and I have been hearing about your team for years.
SECNAV's concerned, so I'd like to get started today, if that's convenient for you.
Where did you get that money?
What made you pick these horses?
A keen mind, an eye for natural talent, a little bit of luck, and of course, they spoke to me.
Who spoke to you?
The horses.
Tony, you may want to stop acting like a jackass.
I can explain, sir.
Doctor?
Dr. Cranston is here to observe your team, Agent Gibbs.
Really.
This stateroom been compromised, Captain?
Uh, yeah, you're good, aren't you?
Gently unscrewing the noggin, huh?
Was there ever a time when someone didn't approve of that behavior from you?
Not gonna happen.
I always feel like a white rat in search of a tasty treat.
Through and through.
There's no gun here.
The slug is still in the mattress.
That's a Tokarev 25.
Uh, seven, including a group of international journalists.
Extra, extra, read all about it.
Got two English reporters on board the ship; two French, one South Korean.
SECNAV is waiting for that team evaluation, Gibbs.
Technically, until Dr. Cranston finishes that report, we're not cleared to operate in the field.
What do you want us to do, Leon, go home?
A bad report can lead to change, Gibbs.
We are who we are, Director Vance.
Don't I know it.
Somebody, talk to me.
Commander Vincent Reynolds graduated Annapolis over 30 years ago.
Served with distinction in the Sixth and Seventh Fleets for the past two decades.
Just 18 months away from retirement when he died.
Uh, single, never married, no children.
According to Captain Lynn, Reynolds was pals with Admiral Wayne Hargrove.
Hargrove's overseeing operations in the Far East, aboard the flagship USS Blue Ridge.
Find out if Reynolds is doing any side work for the admiral.
Well, believe it or not, most people talk about the sex lives.
That rules Tim out.
I will certainly remain professional.
All right, just have a seat.
Hey, I'm a journalist and a South Korean citizen.
I demand to be released.
They twitch, get a little weird look in their eye.
You got one of those right now.
Well... you have no right to detain me.
Actually, we do, 'cause we're in the middle of a murder investigation, so why don't you sit down?
I'll get to you when I'm ready.
Why do you think this guy killed your XO?
Because I saw him and Commander Reynolds arguing last night.
The Korean wouldn't back down.
Eventually, the XO walked away.
Thank you.
Now, why exactly are we doing this?
We are just talking, just getting to know each other.
Okay, but I do not need to know you, and this is actually taking time away from my work.
Sometimes, a little time away from work is a really good thing.
I do admire your dedication, though.
Dedication is important to me.
Why was I excluded?
What is it you expect from me?
Had you ever met Agent Todd?
No, and I know that her loss was, uh, significant to NCIS.
Okay, but if I'm going to be a part of your team, I would love to...
She's gone, Gibbs.
I don't think Kate will mind.
It's always very difficult filling someone else's shoes.
No disrespect, Doctor, but except from the fact that she was... a woman... we are very different agents.
Oh, I can tell that individuality's very important to you.
Are you... that discerning when it comes to men, as well?
Keeping your personal and professional lives in balance is, is important.
And it looks like some men, over the years, have, uh... influenced your work.
My work has never been affected and this is none of your business.
Actually, it is.
You thought I would not identify Michael Rifkin as a Mossad operative.
I am questioning why you didn't tell them you saw him three days ago.
Are you jealous?
He was playing you, Ziva.
You killed him!
He attacked me!
What was I supposed--
You put fire in his chest!
You... weren't... there.
But I should have been!
You loved him.
The-the-the thing that puzzles me... with all this change... of allegiance to country of the type of men you're drawn to, what is it that you're looking for?
What is it that you want?
I want... something... permanent.
Something that can't be taken away.
Is that too much to ask?
I'll have to tell my wife Nancy.
Vincent was like family to us.
I'm not sure I follow, Agent Gibbs.
Vincent Reynolds was just a commander, Admiral.
You're an admiral, Admiral.
Yeah, well, Vincent always knew that, uh, he had the gift of leadership much more than political savvy.
And, uh... he had a bad habit of telling people what he really thought.
Well, then, how can I prove my innocence?
An alibi would be nice.
Commander Reynolds was killed last night, at approximately 2:00 a.m.
I was in my stateroom.
Doing what?
You're about to be accused of murdering an American officer!
Do you understand what's at stake here?
Heck of a powder keg.
All right, I'll negotiate.
See ya in prison.
I was sending e-mails!
E-mails?
I sent them through a series of encoded signals unencrypted by a sub off the coast.
North Korea isn't.
Time stamps on the e-mails will prove my innocence.
I was sending photographs of your weapons systems.
Arrest me for espionage.
At home, they'll call me a hero.
But I swear I'm not a murderer.
Good morning., You're avoiding me.
Doc, I gotta say I've never been a big fan.
Of me, personally, or psychiatrists?
Oh, hello.
Um, the markings on the rounds indicate that the weapon is older.
Are you writing stuff about me?
Just a question I want to remember to ask later.
Do not let me interrupt.
Well, it's too late for that, Sigmund.
I have been scouring the Web and local gun show listings for TT-30 sales or registered buyers-- so far, I have 28.
Of the 250,000 registered firearms owners in the metro area, 28 is peanuts.
Trust me, honey, you don't have enough hours in the day.
They're like lie-detector tests.
They alert us to our fears and weaknesses.
I especially don't like this one.
She's always judging me.
All right, well, obviously that's where the powder burns were.
The gun was held close.
Yeah, with a tremendous pressure.
Note the bruising from the barrel on the commander's chest.
I also found a residue on his knuckles that I sent up to Abby and a severely broken nail on his right hand and hairline fractures on his index and middle fingers.
Defensive wound?
Possibly, yeah.
Just came to say hello.
You seem to have sparked quite a reaction in him.
Yeah, occupational hazard.
I have that effect on people.
I warn you, Doctor, if your intent is to get inside my brain, you will be unsuccessful.
I know all the tricks too well.
It means for the time being, you seem remarkably balanced.
I appreciate the compliment, Doctor.
Nonetheless, dare I say the long hours and isolation occasionally take their toll.
You aren't alone, Doctor.
You got drawers full of people who keep you company.
And they are exceptional listeners.
Nonetheless there are times when I find myself, well... melancholy.
Well, you aren't getting any younger.
I'm sure you recognize the irony of quietly facing the dead every day.
Not only do I recognize the irony, I embrace it.
I appreciate your keeping me covered in front of the others, especially Tony.
Yes, I know how modest you are.
Were.
I'm dead now, Ducky.
Shouldn't be.
Now if you will excuse me, the commander is getting impatient.
Okay, McGee, talk.
Well, Abby just called.
She narrowed down the list of TT-30 and TT-33 buyers who registered guns.
Requested mast against Commander Reynolds, three months ago, for inappropriate conduct.
You can lie down.
Shrinks love that, McGee.
Where are we going, Agent McGee?
Potential suspect's house.
Yeah, I'll admit, it does feel pretty good sometimes, yeah.
You were the one who didn't start out in the military or law enforcement.
The only one with an Ivy League education, yet you successfully transformed from probie to Special Agent.
Who told you about probie?
I'm one of you guys now, right?
No more, no more getting coffee, no more hazing?
"Puh-ro-o-bie."
Deep down, wouldn't you like to be in a committed relationship?
You're asking me to dinner?
Yeah, but, um, I don't think you really would.
That should be enough.
You know, I guess I just haven't found the right girl yet.
With a warrant.
All right, wait out here.
Anyone home?
I thought you said the suspect was still on board the Colonial.
He is, but it's still protocol to check.
No paintings of clowns on the walls.
I guess that's a good sign, huh?
Well, care to analyze this, Doctor?
What do you think-- gun nut?
I was thinking something more clinical, but gun nut works.
XO played favorites.
Maybe Commander Reynolds was just an excellent judge of character.
We'll never know now, will we?
Can you tell me where your Russian TT-30 is?
Guy in Ohio, collector.
If he didn't file the right paperwork, it's not my problem.
If the gun is no longer in his possession, it is most certainly your problem.
Come on.
It's frustrating, isn't it?
Who said I was talking about a candy bar?
How far back do you want to go?
My mom died when I was eight.
They sent me away to school when I was 11.
Am I doing good?
These orders are for you.
I'm passing, on the promotion, Jenny.
We make decisions... and we live with them.
Some decisions are easier than others.
That's the, uh, victim's brother.
About a long-term relationship; plenty.
You got a name?
Peter only knew her by "Nancy."
Well, I know for a fact that you can, uh, work and talk at the same time.
That could happen, but... unlikely.
Okay then, go ahead.
You make Goth look... gorgeous and fun.
I'm not a Goth.
I'm a... scientist.
And a great one.
I make sandwiches for the shelter, on Sundays.
All work and no play.
You two are spending the weekend together.
I miss Kate.
If you-if you didn't, I'd be concerned.
You need someone to fill that void.
And Ziva, she's seeing somebody.
Tape adhesive.
Nancy Hargrove.
You know why I called you?
My husband told me what happened to Vincent.
I'm sorry?
Vincent and I saw each other for over 20 years.
He knew it could never be more than that.
The admiral didn't know?
If he did, he never said anything.
We only got together when my husband was away.
What are you suggesting, Agent Gibbs?
I'm sorry for your loss.
Director... do you have a moment?
Well, I don't know if that's a good thing.
I've never met a group of agents so connected to their work.
Yeah, for better or for worse.
That feeling translate up the ladder?
You've had a rough run.
Been through severe trauma recently.
Have you spoken to anyone about what just happened?
I don't think I like where this is headed.
This is not about me, it's about them.
You're team director.
Comes with the situation.
What do you know about my situation?
Since I got hurt, we've been on SECNAV's radar.
When the vacancy was created at the top of your agency, you induced me to give you this post.
And I want to prove that recent events haven't influenced things around here.
My life is a lie.
You were never supposed to succeed.
I think the recent attempt on your life absolutely terrified you, and now you're questioning yourself.
If you let your guard down for one minute, what are you worried about losing?
Are you sure?
I need these crew members assembled in your mess hall, Captain.
They know who killed your XO.
What was your relationship with Commander Reynolds?
Father figure.
He made us better sailors.
Commander Reynolds' father was in World War II and in Korea.
This is the weapon he carried.
It was given to him by a Russian officer.
We found tape residue on the commander.
So we were thinking, well, what if he taped the gun to his hand so it wouldn't move, no matter what.
His career was over.
So your XO... was about to lose everything he cared about.
The gun was still attached to his hand when I walked in.
Didn't see the bullet casing.
What do you see when you look at him, Agent DiNozzo?
Well it's kind of beautiful up here.
I thought you were going to attack me back in Iggy's stall.
But you can be more.
You ever seen me afraid?
Well, not when the danger is something that we can confront.
Why aren't you sick?
Maybe Agent Todd was hard on you because she knew what you were really capable of.
Too bad she never got a chance to tell you that.
So how'd we do?
I can't tell.
Doctor-patient privilege.
Still one agent I haven't spoken to yet.
Well, that's not going to happen.
I forgot.
You're perfect.
No, no, I'm just too set in my ways to change now.
You know when you were lying there a second ago... you looked just like your sister, you know that?
I heard you quit, Agent Todd!
Happy news gets around fast.
Is that a job offer?
Protection detail's over, Kate.
You did good.
For once, DiNozzo's right.
I'm glad you reached out.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Finally... got to meet the people closest to Kate when she died.
You've been better at letting go than I have.
You don't forget, you just move on.
Right there?
This is where the guy who murdered Kate died.
This is where Ziva shot her own brother.
That, Doc, is closure.
Now, the rest is just memories.
There's nothing wrong with memories.
Kate, sweetie, listen to me-- I got your message.
Uh... so what if he gives you a hard time?
Don't let Gibbs get to you.
You are damn good at your job, and you know it.
Let's talk soon.
Never went to the funeral.
Just couldn't do it.
Families all grieve in different ways.
Let me ask you a question, Gibbs.
See if you can answer.
Man walks into a bar, asks the bartender for a glass of water.
Bartender pulls out a shotgun, fires a blast, just missing the man.
Why the "thank you"... and the tip?
The guy had the hiccups.
It's all about responses, Gibbs.
Director Vance, spending time with your team has been enlightening, to say the least.
Some fight death, and some embrace its solace.
Some recognize their fate... and others do whatever is necessary to alter it.
Sometimes we defy others' expectations, and, occasionally, we rise to meet them.
But the constant, is being true to ourselves.
We do what we have to, when we have to.
We react, for better or worse.
It's why your team succeeds.
A man walks into a bar and asks the bartender for a glass of water.
The bartender pulls out a shotgun...
Susan came to grips with her future.
Dialysis until they find me a donor.
- Well, that won't take very long, will it?
- Three to five years.
In grief over losing her biological daughter...
Grace no longer exists, and that is the last time you will mention her name in this house!
Gaby sought comfort from an unusual source.
Including a long lost son...
And a shocking revelation for Paul.
Felicia Tillman has gone to some extraordinary lengths to cause you harm.
Paul Young had made a discovery... his wife was a liar.
She had lied with every smile, with every caress, and with every kiss.
Yes, Paul now knew their entire marriage was a fraud.
The only thing he didn't know...
I talked the doctor into letting me out early.
Things on the street have been getting very strange.
Beth, things on that street have always been very strange.
Well, yes, but...
Remember I told you how Bree was inviting me over - for drinks with the other women?
They must've planted it there.
I'm sure Bree's going to turn it over to the police, and they're going to think I shot you.
Beth... you don't have to worry about what anyone else thinks.
I know the truth.
Hey, here's an idea.
Why don't we take a trip?
A trip?
We need to get away.
Paul had no choice but to punish his wife...
I love you.
Because some lies... are unforgiveable.
We are reminded every spring... with every rose that blooms, with every sunflower that blossoms, with every lily that buds.
You're friends with Barbara Fairchild, the interior designer?
And people think you're the smart one.
Look, you know we just adopted a little girl.
Well, we hired Barbara to decorate her room.
- Well, why not hire me?
- You're not exactly maternal.
We-we wanted this room to be pink and nurturing, and your style seems more like chrome and glass and... teeth.
Look who's back to being the smart one.
Just so you know, our daughter gets here in a week.
And just so you know, I'm as maternal as the next woman.
$840 at Miss Charlotte's doll academy?
Did I say lunch?
Why are you buying our kids fancy toys?
Last week, Juanita used her doll's leg to scrape peanut butter out of the jar.
Uh, yes, but he's not available at the moment.
Well, I would be happy to tell him what it's regarding if you... tell me... what it's regarding.
Why exactly would he be doing that?
You're... kind of a nosy landlady, aren't you?
So he... lives here with you?
Yes.
Yeah, of... of course he does.
Of course he does.
Are you all right?
Okay, you're all set.
The dialysis will take six hours.
- If you need anything, just hit the call button.
It's my first time in here.
Dick.
Any tips for a newbie?
Like, which nurse has the shakes or where do they hide the good painkillers?
Look, nothing personal, but I don't want to be your dialysis buddy.
I wanna sit here and play scrabble on my phone while this... while this machine washes my blood.
So you don't want to talk or be friendly or keep each other company?
Sad, isn't it?
Yep, and your brother just pulled up with her.
Okay, grandma, enjoy your visit.
She's going back in a cab.
Be thankful she didn't yell it to you as you were getting on the bus.
So... uh, what's new?
Married?
We met in water aerobics at the retirement community.
This is kind of a shock.
This saturday?
Uh, and you're just telling me now?
You wanna make sure his intentions are honorable?
All right, come by tomorrow, and we'll squeeze you in between "Nothing to do" and "Waiting for death."
Really?
And at this time I'd like to point out that dreaming of an old girlfriend is not cheating.
Well... when was this?
Seven years?
Was it serious?
We lived together... for, uh, three years.
So you were in love with her.
Well... yeah, until she left me.
So she left you.
You miss her?
I tend to not dwell on people who stomped on my heart.
Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go back to sleep so I can dream about you.
It's so great visiting a retirement village... 2 regular parking spaces, 48 handicapped.
It is so nice to meet you, Frank.
Call me "dad."
We've been waiting ten minutes for our menu.
What do I got to do to get you to hurry it over, build a fence?
Hey, it's a menu, not a high school diploma.
Lynette's been dying to meet you.
She has so many questions.
Frank... is very to the point.
Um, have you ever been married before?
Three times... two dead and two left me.
I wanted to get the name of that chinese place you and Roy are always raving about.
I've got a menu here somewhere.
I never noticed that before.
What?
That doll.
Oh, Adelaide.
Heck, I've had her since forever.
She was my best friend growing up.
I couldn't bear to toss her, so there she is.
I didn't know you were into dolls.
I'm not really into them.
Where did, uh, that come from?
I carry her around with me.
Okay.
Oh, I have an idea.
Well... maybe.
What's wrong?
I said "No mayo," Like, 15 times.
I want my hamburger the way I ordered it.
- I'll get you a new one.
- I got tee time in ten minutes.
So go!
It'll be waiting for you at the condo, wrapped in foil, with an ice cold beer when you get there.
You're... you're so good to me.
See you at the wedding, Lorraine.
So what do you think?
Well, he's quite a...
No, he crossed the border of racist.
He lives in racist.
You cannot seriously love him.
I don't.
You... you don't?
Then why are you marrying him?
Because he's loaded, and he hates his kids, and he's got a bad ticker.
And when he kicks the bucket, I get everything.
You're marrying him for his money?
Please.
And by the way, he's getting something out of this, too.
You wanna know how I really broke my foot?
Couldn't sleep.
I've just been... sitting here, thinking.
About what?
I'm tired of hating people, but I don't know how to stop.
What a thing to say.
Stop being so hard on yourself.
You're a decent man.
You just need to focus on what's good in your life.
What is that again?
Well, for starters, me.
I do think about you... all the time.
From the first moment I met you, all I wanted was for you to love me.
You're just tired.
Come back to bed.
All right.
Tomorrow we can talk about our trip.
We need to decide where we're going.
Oh, that sounds... rustic.
I need to go somewhere far away where nobody can find us.
Okay.
You can be happy, Paul.
You just need to identify what's negative in your life... and then get rid of it.
That sounds like a plan.
Actually, I wanna talk to you about Gaby.
How's she doing lately?
Well, you know, we went through kind of a rough patch, but I think she's coming around now.
What are you doing here?
This wasn't a gift for Bob and Lee, was it?
Why'd you lie to me?
Because I knew you wouldn't understand.
You spent $800 on a doll for yourself.
That was your rule!
I'm going to get ready for dinner.
Hey, Susan.
I kept her warm for ya.
- No problem.
Scrabble.
Look, I know you don't wanna talk, but I thought it would be more fun to play with me than with your phone.
Thanks, but I'll take the phone.
Susan, did you ever see the old war movie where the fresh young kid comes in all bright-eyed, and the old vet won't give him the time of day?
What about the one where the girl moves to a different town, and the mean cheerleader at her new school doesn't wanna hang out with her?
Go on.
And I'm letting you know we're not going to be friends.
You know, I can see why you're frustrated.
Waiting for a transplant is brutal.
The good news?
When this beeper goes off, that means someone died.
That's what we do.
We wait for tragedy and then cross our fingers that it's us they wake up at 2:00 in the morning with the good news.
I wasn't trying to comfort... you.
Well, you seemed so upset when you came over, and obviously it involves Keith, or you wouldn't have come looking for him, and so naturally I'm concerned.
Anyway, I'm... sort of in the middle of packing, so...
Mommy, I can't find my ball.
Charlie, I'll be with you in a second, okay?
I had actually moved out before I realized I was pregnant.
So why didn't you tell Keith?
I had actually decided to give up the baby, and I knew he would try and talk me out of it.
Then I changed my mind the moment I saw Charlie.
After that, it just never felt right to come back and ambush him with a kid.
And yet... here you are, ambushing.
So Charlie is the only reason you came?
But I'm glad he's happy.
You seem really great.
Would you like me to?
You would do that?
I think I have to.
Now, it's not exactly finished yet.
I'm still waiting on a few pieces, and the curtains are on back order.
But you did keep the receipts, right?
Oh, my god.
It's exactly the room I wanted when I was growing up.
I mean, the only thing that's missing is... baby unicorns!
How did you put this together so quickly?
Oh, it was easy.
I've been thinking about this room for 20 years.
Really?
There was a time when I thought I might have kids.
Right down to the last detail.
I never knew you thought about kids.
Well, that was a long time ago.
This is not the color we agreed on for the trim.
I can't wheel her down the aisle to marry some jackass she doesn't even love.
Lynette, you have to do this.
Besides, you know, think of what's at stake now.
What are you talking about?
Well, you know, how can I put this delicately?
I mean, today your mother has money.
Someday soon she will die.
The day after that, Tom and Lynette have money.
That's a horrible thing to say.
Well, just saying, you've always wanted to put Paige in private school, and I've always wanted to know what it's like to sleep on a yacht.
You're lucky you're holding the baby.
Lynette!
Yeah?
They're playing my song.
Are you ready to wheel me down?
Who asked you?
You can't marry an obnoxious jerk like that.
Mom, you want me to visit more often?
That is never gonna happen if you're with him.
And think about the example you are setting your grandchildren... marrying a guy for his money.
Now, look, Tom and I have a little savings...
Nobody needs me anymore.
And Frank... needs me.
Why didn't you tell me this?
Why did you let me think it was all about the money?
I guess it was easier to say that than to admit how... useless and... lonely I feel.
Okay.
This church is in one of those ethnic neighborhoods, and I'm worried about the car.
Renee, there is someone we'd like you to meet.
This is our daughter.
- Hello.
- We just picked her up from the airport, and we wanted you to be the first person on the lane to meet her.
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
I think I'm gonna start getting her settled in.
Come on.
She's absolutely precious.
Listen, can I ask you for a favor?
Lee, you know I don't like sentences that start that way.
Bob and I have been thinking, and even though I know we are gonna be great fathers, there may be times that Jenny needs to talk to a woman about... stuff.
And on those rare occasions, I was wondering if we could bring her over here.
Well... sure.
Why are you always so miserable?
It's called anger, Susan.
I'm sure you have it, too, right underneath that "Hang in there, kitty" smile.
So stop dragging us into your circle of self-pity.
It's me.
I'm so happy for you.
Ready, Susan?
Yes.
Actually, um, i-if it's okay, I'm gonna... sit over here today.
What are you doing?
Leaving a note for the gardener.
Not at all.
I'm sure your wife told you a gun was recently discovered at Bree van de Kamp's house.
Yes, apparently it was the same caliber that I was shot with.
Bree seems to think your wife planted it there, hoping to implicate some of her friends in your shooting.
What an imagination she has.
So you've never seen this before?
Mr. Young?
Yes.
You seemed to have quite a reaction there.
I'm not comfortable around firearms, that's all.
Well, just to be clear, you do not believe this belongs to your wife.
Detectives, I know for a fact this is not Beth's gun.
Good day.
Should we take two blankets or three?
What?
Oh, shoot.
And I was so looking forward to it.
So I, um, stopped by Bob and Lee's house.
Is that... still the case?
Uh, yeah.
Okay, well, let me rephrase it.
If you had the chance to be a father, would you take it?
Bree, where is this coming from?
I thought we dealt with this.
Well, I just wanna make sure.
What do you want me to say?
I'm just saying... if you had the choice...
I don't.
This is really good chicken.
So?
I'm sorry.
He doesn't even wanna meet Charlie?
Why did I wait so long?
Again, I am so sorry.
Now where is this chinese pl... aah!
I don't need a therapist.
Carlos, I'm not crazy.
Well, then should I change the reservation to three?
This doesn't look like a place you'd put a restaurant.
No, it looks like a place you'd bury a body.
What's the address?
Uh, can you hold on?
It's not Grace!
Pruning them.
Looks like you're killing them.
I know it looks bad, but sometimes you have to be ruthless if you want something beautiful to keep growing.
The world is filled with people who do ugly things.
Why do they act this way?
Some lie to keep from losing what they love.
Some lash out because they fear the future.
Some put up walls because they have regrets.
Yes, everyone has a reason for the ugly things they do... and once we find out why... then we can try to stop them.
It's probably good nothing happened between us.
Yoohoo, I can't tell you where you can or can't be, can I?
No, you can't.
If she wants to stay and chat with inbreds and lesbos...
Hang on a fucking minute!
Now get the fuck out of my party.
Good morning, everyone.
Thank you, everyone.
Where are the outfits?
Er... this is a committee-only meeting.
Actually, Mins, Franky's been a life-saver.
I couldn't have made them without her, and she'll be great with the music.
Thanks a million, Franky.
Er... why don't you girls show us the fruits of your labours?
As we're raising money for the blind, our theme is tactile textures.
So, we've used classic suit and dress patterns with loads of different fabrics that are cool to touch, like silk, faux fur and velvet.
I knew this was gonna happen.
I understand we all need a platform to express ourselves but this show is not about you, Grace.
They're so... weird.
I see what you mean.
I propose a drastic rethink.
I've got it.
White tie and tiara.
I won't let you down, sir.
Right.
Firstly, remove your hand from my arm.
It's just you've been really rude to me and it's not fair.
Can you just stop being bitches so we can all be friends, OK?
I can't believe you just called us bitches.
You're meant to be my best friends and you just told everyone I'm having a breakdown, and I'm not!
You only have yourself to blame.
Listen, I need you for a few minutes.
Oi, Mini, when Nick stops satisfying you, my cock is all yours, yeah?
- Boys, say bye-bye to your captain.
OK, how would you like to be the best boyfriend in the world and help me out at the charity fashion show?
Training comes first.
Do you not want to know what my surprise is?
My dad's away until Saturday.
We finally have the house to ourselves.
Fashion show comes first.
That's just another excuse.
I've waited weeks for this.
You said you wanted to, next time I had a free gaff.
I do the fashion show, you stay over tonight.
You're the ultimate boyfriend.
- Oh, bring a friend too.
I'm not a slag!
Well, from the stories you tell, you're no virgin.
Are you?
I'm just not sure you'll be able to handle me.
Babe, you don't want to know what I've handled.
I really don't.
My exes are nothing compared to you.
And I promise tonight will be special.
Perfect.
Fuck.
Um... he's your partner for the finale.
Well, the... the bit before the finale.
When's your friend going to show us what he's got in store for Olivia?
Music!
Can't wait for tonight, babes.
Come round about eight.
I love you.
Mm, yeah, me too.
It's like looking in a mirror.
You wish.
Over here, missus.
Didn't keep you up last night, did I?
It's much better.
What a stunner you are.
Off you go and have fun.
Well, you hold onto him, angel.
You don't want to end up like me.
Remember, men only want one thing, and once they've got it, they disappear into thin air.
Pick your spot and visualise yourself putting that ball right there.
That is gross.
Mins, let's head back to mine.
Er... if you're happy to give up just like that, then that's cool.
I just thought my boyfriend was better than that.
All right, OK, one more game and then we head back to the crib.
And let's spice things up a bit.
Er... not for me and Liv.
You dickhead.
Go on, give us a swig.
Fuck it.
That's my girl.
Oh, it must have fallen out in there.
Let's head back to mine.
Mum's working a late-nighter, won't be back for ages.
Right, here's one you girls can't get out of.
Liv, that bra's coming off.
Come on, Min, you too.
That's cheating, man.
Get your jugs out!
Dress off, dress off, dress off!
There's only one person that gets to check out what's under here.
I don't care what you've done or never done.
You're amazing.
It's a bonus.
Liv's panting is ruining the mood.
Well, at least she's having fun.
Babe, it's been way over a month.
Show me, then.
Where's the fucking Domestos?
There's always tomorrow.
I've run out of ideas on how to get her into bed.
Rewind.
You two haven't...?
She's full-on all the time.
I've never been here before.
Don't know anything about her mum or dad.
It's just mum.
Liv, I don't even know her.
And now I've been dragged into this stupid fashion show.
We're gonna be laughed at.
She can't dance.
And I'm her best friend.
We need to give her a bit of help.
What?
I'm sleepy.
Good girls don't swallow.
I've got the hangover from hell and three hours to do 101 jobs.
It's Mini, obviously.
Hi, gorgeous.
Yeah, move.
Has anyone seen Nick or Liv?
'The rest of you, look hot and keep your heads down.
Because I've been looking for you!
How very thoughtful.
Liv, dress off now.
Your saggy tits have stretched it.
Oh, don't be a dick.
I bet you two had a right laugh.
Mini, you haven't got enough dresses.
Mini, who's doing our hair?
Roundview charity fashion show.
Anything else?
Five pounds.
Starts at 7.30.
What have you done?
What's wrong?
Mini, I...
Where are you going?
I can't abandon the troops.
Reward comes from dedication, hard work, passion.
Tonight was all her idea.
She's always encouraging us to do new things.
Unfortunately, she is unwell and couldn't perform.
Where's Nick?
What?
Stay away from us.
Hi.
You look nice.
Are we still friends?
I was hoping more than that.
If that's cool with you.
Mini, what's going on with you?
You're freaking me and Nick out.
You've been bitching behind my back?
Typical of you!
You've always been jealous of me.
You are making a top prat of yourself.
But I am the only one.
Get it together, you stupid bitch!
Fuck!
I can't find Nick.
Grace is here.
I know.
I'm not trying to ruin your life, Mini.
You could have fooled me.
of self-absorbed, attention-seeking cocks.
You love each other.
Come and dance.
Take me to yours.
This is gonna be worth the wait, I promise.
Let's blank today out.
It... it didn't happen.
None of it happened.
Please.
Do you have, um... a...
Sure, cool.
Mini... .. anything you want to tell me?
I love you.
Anything you want to tell me?
You love me too, don't you?
All right there, my lovely?
You fancy a ride?
Come on.
Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations.
Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021.
I was just saying-- what are you doing here?
What was she doing there?
For that, we have to back up about ten years.
So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.
Not according to her.
But... this is my number.
And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...
No, I don't.
Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.
Call her?
she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.
That is ridiculous.
Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain.
He flipped out and demanded a divorce.
Gee, wonder why.
He left the box with the doorman.
If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.
Yeah, he's been really... quiet.
No, it's more than that.
Or we could just do it the normal way.
This is about Nora.
You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot.
Damn it!
Maybe after this documentary on garbage.
Man, I am losing my touch.
Sepawated from its pawents, this young bird stwuggles to survive, stwangling itself in the plastic wings of a six-pack.
Marshall Eriksen, I think you know what you have to do.
What a surprise.
Ted.
Garbage Island.
Phase one: the bar.
I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative.
I threw my back out.
Ted, beneath this lustrous mane, I wear the horns of a cuckold.
Blissful as Arcadian shepherds.
I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite.
But then... enter the scoundrel.
Oh, man, this movie's scary.
Anyway, soon the inevitable happened.
She told me she was in love with someone else.
Obviously, it made me angry.
And that's the last time you saw her.
But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her.
I begged her not to leave.
We made love that night.
That's damn good brandy.
But morning came, and she was gone.
Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.
Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.
Damn it!
Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.
Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.
Come on, come on.
You lying little minx.
I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.
So you should just call her.
Here is her number.
And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom.
You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.
If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan.
With great penis comes great responsibility.
Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.
Careful, Robin, I'll do it.
Sex now, we'll do the foreplay after.
The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way...
I mean, didn't we do a whole thing?
You did meet Sting.
Well, because we can always do more.
Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?
Well, he has some good points.
...nice presentation.
Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish!
Weren't you listening?
Ted...
I know.
Know what?
You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is...
That son of a bitch!
You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?
He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her.
I know how these things work.
He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his.
Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel.
The mustache alone gives that away.
He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!
You and Zoey have nothing in common.
Just to have one thing in common?
And you'll find one.
Yeah, yeah!
Okay, baby, what gives?
I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.
I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.
All right, Robin, give it to me.
The number.
In what moon man language is that a five?
How am I supposed to see that's a five?
I have a phone call to make.
Barney.
Go get her.
Did I steal you?
Well, the story isn't over, Ted.
It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.
I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.
If you say so.
I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken.
Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.
Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?
And he was always so proud of me for that.
Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?
Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me.
The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.
Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now.
And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet-- you know, like, a year from now-- then we'll start a family.
I don't know.
Oh, Meeker hated him, all right.
After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired.
But as luck would have it...
Are you guys...?
Thanks.
Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault.
But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids.
You probably don't remember me, do you.
I texted, that's the same thing.
That is not the same thing, you douche!
It's not the same thing.
Do you even remember what we did that night?
Well, whatever it was you don't want to say it in front of this prude.
You had us sit in the front row and it smelled like [bleep].
You guys are all the same.
That's like my life on a daily basis.
... gonna get you fired!
Evening, I want to give a warm welcome to Officer Pearce, who's back with us after a thankless short stay in the hospital.
And, I want you to give a fond farewell to Rodney, our former sound man, who bit it in a donut shop Fiday night, because he was not paying attention.
He didn't deserve to die that way.
On that note, let's say hello to our new sound man, Roger.
Uh, Jamie, actually, but a, ... is this thing on?
Sound check.
You will see these posters around the Valley.
"Help Us" ... "Help You"
"Don't be ... a sucker"
Guys, gays ... straight ... filipino lady boy.
It's all just labels, anyway, right.
We're all God's children ... lights go down, it all feels the same.
Finally, let's get out there and kill something.
I'm more than ready.
Take those clothes off and get ready for the ride of your life.
Okay, Princess, you're done here.
And, if you need to make a call, you can use my phone or the phone on the booking desk.
I don't have anyone to call.
You don't want anybody to come get you?
I got Matteo killed.
Hey ... noone's coming to get me.
Some teens are beating up a slow walker.
The man just asked a question.
Yes, a zombie.
When they're around too long, they do that ... drunk shuffle.
All right, you guys got nothing better to do tonight than beat up some poor zombie?
You just don't go beating on it with a baseball bat.
You take care of it in a proper way.
The vamps, the vamps I hate.
Run drugs, they launder money, they're heavy into the sex for blood trade.
They're kind of like the doucebags of the monster community, if you will.
And, then Tessa, the little one, she just turned three.
I used to date his best friend, Rico.
Is he the one who got you into this?
Or, maybe ... we don't.
What don't you understand about that?
Okay, I'll try.
You guys stay close, all right.
What the f ... come on, man.
Yeah, I'm not sure how much we can bleep, to be totally honest, so.
What the hell you think you're doing?
Just helping out the UTP, man.
Let's see how tough you are when some 'freshie' comes after you and tears you up like a sparerib.
Good evening.
Yes, lovely home you have here.
Sorry about all the boxes all over the place.
Aah, Wheaton's, effective man stoppers.
I say partner, of course I mean that in a professional sense.
Like I said, partners.
Just need to get the latch open.
Well, spit in my salad.
Staying in a [bleep]damn motel.
Hey, don't romanticise it Stu,
She's a whore, and a vampire and a prostitute.
And, that's all she's ever going to be.
We gonna sit here and solve the whole world's problems or, are we going to go bust that vampire whore.
Don't say it like that.
Magic ... [siren]
You understand me?
Captain, if you close that up you'll ...
All right, come to papa, you son of a bitch.
Come on out, you glorified squirrel.
No.
Can't hear you, speak louder.
Oh, what the hell, maybe, it is a john.
Or it's her pimp and he's going to have sex with her anyway.
I'd French kiss my mother with this mouth.
Oh, there goes the belt, wait a minute,
Where'd everybody go?
Figures.
listen, sorry about, a, you know,
Listen, don't you have ... don't your kids have to be up in like three hours?
Yeah ... yeah, ... usually make Lucille lunch.
I love that about you, man.
Well, let's get you some sleep.
Is Stevie around?
What's inside the radio?
I can't bring it back to the halfway house with me.
Half of that stash is now mine.
I want to feed you and probe your higher self.
What the shit do you want?
Is your mommy home, either of you?
She's still out.
Mom told us why you went to jail --
For killing a Mexican, a defenseless woman Mexican who died because you killed her.
Did it feel good at all, the killing?
Like, make the pain go away?
And there's a voice inside the darkness.
Certified, biatch.
'Cause comfort is the first sign of death.
This place keeps you on guard, jump-starts your blood flow, increases overall life-span.
I'm looking for the other one of these.
Ah, someone's here in the room, right here with us.
Did you check the hamper?
In the middle.
Of us?
Those are the custody papers.
You're pro bono, right?
You're pro bono.
Would you like to see the steward havens trapper keeper of broken dreams?
I-I really think I would.
Basically, my clients tell me their stories from inside the clink, and -- and I put the best ones in the steward havens trapper keeper of broken dreams.
I can only balance three clients at one time.
And right now, there's one slot open.
M-my cell mate used to make, uh, fermented yam wine in our toilet.
The mob had my Mexican husband killed in prison.
Go on.
They made it look like a hate crime.
Look, uh, even with my help, you're fucked.
Your sister is the only mom your kid knows.
So we're gonna have to show a judge that you're trying.
Has she asked you for anything?
A stupid preschool deposit -- $2,800.
Would I have to look at her shit-eating grin and --
That's all that I've been thinking of.
Next time.
And you financed this how?
Uh, multiple student loans.
Where are you going?
Drug business.
It's what our family does, Shane.
Only now we're equal partners.
Since when?
Since last night.
We have a new relationship, where she treats us like real people, where we don't have to listen to everything she says or blindly follow orders.
So, when Nancy tells us to go to college, what do we do?
We buy hot tubs?
So, I was thinking, if we're gonna be a partnership --
I need you to deal.
That is not a partnership.
That is a "you telling me what to do"-ship.
There's no time.
How much would we get if you cashed in what we have now?
In this town, with that quality, 10 grand, easy.
Silas, we have to start somewhere.
So, you'll do it.
Let's see -- crunchy noodles in duck sauce, fried rice.
Wish I'd have gotten enough for both of us, but I didn't.
You seem hostile.
Maybe apologize for our sins from the past.
Did he turn around?
Where are you going?
I have a job interview.
Silas, please.
That crispy-duck thing sounded so good.
You can get more, right?
Ah, no can do, Nance.
If I don't have a job, I can't get my kid back.
Do you really want another kid?
Look, softball season starts in a week.
You come in twice a week.
No, I need to be in the system --
Pay stubs, W-9S, documentation.
I'm sorry, lady.
My leg's tired now.
I love you, Nancy Botwin.
Look, take some petty cash, go to Bloomies, get yourself a nice dress, some shoes.
Now stab me in the ass.
Did I die in Copenhagen?
Does that mean I touched him?
No, that means you blew him.
Popsicle represents the ephemeral penis.
Its melting affirms the strength of woman.
Your new bedroom looks expensive.
I didn't get this stuff for me.
No, I'm -- but -- Now.
Red like the rising sun or yellow like their Pac-Man faces?
Does your, uh, cellphone have a camera?
She's cool.
I'll take 1/8 of AK-47, 1/8 of Wet Julie.
She used to be a -- Nun.
So, um, it's okay.
Wicked.
Oh, you noticed, huh?
Nice.
Yeah, I think the steroids are giving me acne.
Hold that thought.
I already have a dealer.
That could be shit that makes me fucking fatter.
Why would you give me free pot?
'Cause if you like it, you give me a call and buy some more.
Thanks.
Have dinner with me tonight?
Are you talking to me?
What's the C.E.O. doing in the copy room?
Not making copies.
No, he's not.
I-I would like to keep my job.
You're saying, "Fuck off."
What you got there?
Oh, stuff.
Market research.
Charles was my English professor.
Uh, when do you go away?
Does our relationship make you uncomfortable?
I had a moment of panic last night where I said, "Am I uncomfortable about this?
"And if so, what does that mean?
"Perhaps I need to look inward and ask the big blah-di-blah questions."
So I did that for five minutes, and, long story short, that's not the case.
I'm just freaked out by you specifically.
Andy -- And last night, there was a dream about a hot dog.
What?
The bumpy floors, the life-extending apartment, the danger room -- she built that for me.
It's not a competition.
About earlier...
Oh, inappropriate but harmless.
'Cause I feel terrible.
I never would have asked you out if I'd known you were one of these crazy, uptight, militant, antidrug bitches.
That's just a little intense for me.
'Cause I-I can make that happen.
I got to run.
Keep the shoes.
Where's your brother?
Um, no -- uh, a terrorist video.
I figured when you're out of the halfway house, you'll need a place to crash, so I tried to remember what the Agrestic bedroom looked like.
I couldn't remember if your bed was a king or a queen.
It was a queen.
You can't --
All this has to go back.
That money was supposed to go towards school, like I said.
So, you don't like it?
And how rich do you think we used to be?
We got all that stuff at -- at J.C. Penney.
You put this together?
Today, I opened up 31 Broad Street, downtown.
The whole building?
There's -- there's gonna be a lot of demand.
I don't have anything left.
Really?
Can I have the cash?
Well, there is no cash yet.
From selling the drugs.
There's no cash from selling the drugs.
There's always cash from selling the drugs.
That's why we sell drugs.
Not when you give them away for free.
Why would we...
Your cellphone is ringing!
I know.
I got orders on here for twice what we let go.
I am better at this than you know.
How much, um, cash do you have?
'Cause I need it.
We need it.
I don't want you to go back to prison.
It's my fault you went there once.
I want it back, plus 20%.
What about your loan checks?
I only got one so far, and you said those are for school and hot tubs.
Yeah, whatever.
Then g-give me your weed.
No, these are my last three joints.
Got to give it a month.
Come on, baby.
And since that's the school all his friends are going to, he won't be able to play with them.
I'm sure he'll get over it.
I never had any friends, and I turned out fine.
She just wanted you to see the disappointment you caused before she made it all better.
I'm just waiting on you.
Look at this.
You think you've got me cornered?
Nina!
Yes, but what about the intel?
Our mission is complete.
This was all just a decoy?
To be honest, I didn't think it would be so easy.
Now we just have to wait for Jin and the Mishima Zaibatsu to make their move.
All right, what's next?
Where else do we look?
Every single research facility has been shut down and the data erased.
It revealed to us they're as hungry for intel as we are.
Proving that G Corp hasn't gotten their hands on the specimen, either.
It's perfect for espionage.
I hope you realize what will happen, if you two fight.
If the world can be destroyed by a mere father-son quarrel, then so be it.
Who are they?
Survivors of the Mutare?
I finally have some good news.
We've found our target, and he's quite handsome.
I'll be flying to Kyoto tonight to confirm.
Run a background check first.
Last thing I want is for Jin to find out.
For this particular job, I have the perfect candidate.
One minute, twelve seconds left!
Hurry up!
Xiaoyu Ling of class B.
You have been summoned to the principal's office now!
Because you think I'm late?
That's not it.
We have no budget for a student like you.
You always told me you didn't have a budget.
Every time you go to P.E. You destroy something.
That's because you keep telling me not to hold back.
And then there's this.
Yesterday's test results!
You're flunking every subject!
Come on, you don't have to be so harsh about it.
And you have a complete lack of discipline.
So in accordance with our rules, you'll be expelled and transferred!
Don't act like you know me!
Who the hell are you?
You'll be transferred to a high school in Kyoto.
Make contact with this student and learn what you can.
Why me?
The Zaibatsu isn't the only one with access to Mishima Polytech.
G?
Now I believe you know who runs G Corp.
Kazuya Mishima.
And checkmate, my little pawn.
You'll be attending Kyogoku Academy, one of the most esteemed international schools in Kyoto.
Affluent families from around the world send their children here.
Security is air tight, making access to personal records impossible.
The best approach will be by sending in a student of our own.
Tell me, is that spelled with a Y and a U?
But, sir, every seat is available.
The students are busy with the coming festival.
You know, I could care less about G Corp. If he wasn't so hot there's no way I would be doing this.
The challenge is figuring out a way for the two of us to meet.
It would be great if I could just turn a corner and bump into him.
Like in some cheesy soap opera.
I'm so sorry.
Man, running into some girl's not gonna help me.
No uniform?
International schools sure are the way to go.
He should be right around here somewhere, but where?
A shoe?
Oh my god!
What are you thinking?
You'd normally be dead.
Well, I'm not normal.
Were you trying to... it's none of your business.
Twice in the three months he's been here.
So is he actually trying to kill himself?
I don't really know for sure.
It's obvious!
Well the first time, he sort of lunged off the roof.
So, he fell right on you?
Is this guy a friend of yours?
If I get caught, I'm gonna end up in major trouble.
Anybody home?
He did go to Mishima Polytechnic.
Why was he trying to hide this one?
X-Xiaoyu?
Ls that you?
Come on!
See you soon, my fair maidens.
I know you're waiting to send a report, so do it.
What were you doing there?
I'd like to ask you the same thing.
And you were going to give it to him in the shower?
Course not!
You were peeping there, too.
My intentions are far more decent than wanting a peep show.
That is so not it!
If you don't come clean, I'll report you.
Really?
Look, I'm sorry.
This means you're my competition now!
And I will not lose!
So then, I'm guessing you made contact.
Shin used to go to Mishima Polytech.
And he was friends with Jin.
You couldn't have told me this before?
That makes them two years older than you.
What is this?
A mass disappearance?
Out of the blue one day, an entire class suddenly went missing.
But one guy survived, didn't he?
Are you saying Shin Kamiya is somehow immortal?
This means there's a chance Jin might make contact with Shin.
It is built on an ancient burial site where the sacred earth goddess spirit was enshrined.
Thanks, I'll think about it.
Savior?
Wh-what're you talking about?
Not at all!
Hey, wait.
Why are you calling me your savior?
But she does have interesting taste.
A pair of tickets to the Mokujin Exhibit?
What was she thinking?
You dropped this the other day.
That's a big coincidence.
Never thought I'd bump into someone from that school here.
So, it's not a coincidence.
Were you attending Mishima when this happened?
Are we done here?
Yeah.
You mean, Jin?
No, it's been years.
I just hear bad rumors about him now.
Like he's leading the Mishima Zaibatsu with a huge bounty on his head.
You know, it's all too much to believe.
But unlike everything around here, people change.
It could never endure like nature can.
Everything humans do, either good or bad, will eventually turn to dust.
W-wait!
I think it's time we got started.
I mean to try and get Shin to notice me.
A while back, I lost a really good friend of mine.
Were you in love with this guy?
I-I'm sorry.
Hey, I think you're doing fine with Shin.
So do you believe I should keep trying?
Of course!
Using what?
I'm not following.
See there's also a contest for the boys, too.
And the winners of each contest, usually end up becoming a couple.
I know that Shin's a contestant, so if he and I win, I'll become his girlfriend!
Each contestant creates a live broadcast and then all of the students vote on it.
Where is the AV room?
I can't believe they're recording these things live!
I'm Shin Kamiya, and this is my entry video.
What you're about to watch is a bid like no other for this title.
Xiaoyu?
Hey...they're supposed to be recording it live in here.
Don't tell me!
They weren't recording it live.
So what does this mean?
That clip was like a ransom note.
Kidnapped?
Ransom note?
Hey, what's with that voice?
What are you...
Stop!
Just what on earth are you?
There's no data on her at the embassy or with Immigration because she was imported?
Alisa Bosconovitch.
Mishima Zaibatsu?
What?
Imported item?
Not only do you come back a failure, but now you've reduced yourself to petty thievery.
Ugh, Anna.
You knew she was working for the other side?
I wasn't certain yet.
We were just waiting each other out until one of us finally blinked.
Are you mad?
Then find that little girl and destroy her.
Can't...breathe...
The first friend you made at school is now your enemy.
I got your message and accept your challenge.
It was all a lie from the very beginning.
I failed my mission.
Were you lying when you said you loved Shin?
Alisa?
Attack mode!
I have been programmed to destroy you.
I can't believe that you're a robot.
Battle mode activated.
I don't believe that for a second!
He was kidnapped by the G Corporation, wasn't he?
There's either conflicting data surrounding this or once again, you are lying to me.
What good would lying do for me now, huh?
I don't trust you.
Saved by the mercy of a robot?
What a pathetic heroine you are.
Long enough.
Now gimme intel.
I want all you got on the Mishima Group in that tin-can brain.
You don't have proper clearance for that information.
I'll jam a cable in your head if I need to.
Self-defense systems activate.
Must adhere to programming.
Xiao...yu...
Feel free to do what you want, but this will make you our enemy.
Thanks, Panda!
Emergency escape mode activate!
Alisa, this is awesome!
What is it?
Are you sure about this?
About what?
You know they're gonna come after you too, now.
Anna and Kazuya never had my back.
Actually, it would seem I owe you one.
Well if I'm the one who saved you last, then aren't you the one who's in debt to me again?
Isn't that how it works?
That will make it go on forever.
That's fine with me.
Excellent!
This place is like a castle!
This is what you could call the premiere guest room.
Please, make yourselves at home.
Feel free to peruse the closet.
Thank you so much, Xiaoyu.
So it would appear that the G Corporation isn't the one responsible for the kidnapping.
So then, who could it be?
Nobody ever briefed you on this matter?
Guess they felt it wasn't necessary for me to know.
I was simply told to investigate Shin Kamiya and also to gather intel on him and his contacts.
Well then, guess we were both pawns in their game.
Nina?
You ever met Jin Kazama?
Oh, no reason.
It appears she's doing her own investigation now and ignoring our orders completely.
Sometimes in order to succeed, you have to fail.
G Corp will try and hone in on her internal transmitter.
You're on your own now.
All right, let's see what ghosts from the past turn up this time.
So, this was your old school, huh?
If Mishima Zaibatsu or G Corp didn't take him, then maybe some kind of clue from his past will tell us who did.
Yes, but please remember that I lost my net link, and that includes any access I had to the Mishima Zaibatsu's data.
Maybe, but there's more than one way to get info.
Yes, that's true.
We can learn other things here, too.
Like what?
Like embarrassing things you did when you were a student here.
Well they're aren't any.
Now c'mon, start scanning!
Who knew my old school had so much going on underground.
Well it's protected by a thick shielding making it detectable only by active sonar.
It appears to be some kind of research facility.
The data these machines collect would be used for genetic engineering.
Genetic engineering?
Let me give it a try.
Hmm... 78M.
Mutare Experiment?
The term dates back to the 18th century where it was first used in experiments by botanist and geneticist, Dr. Hugo de Vries.
It's from his experiments the term "mutant" was derived.
I can't believe they experimented on students!
So then, he's immortal because...
Because his genetic code contains the rare M-cell.
Like me, Shin is trapped in a body that defies nature.
And he too, is thought of as nothing more than a pawn.
Xiaoyu... what's the matter?
Principal Heihachi Mishima passed away three years ago.
He's dead?
He once ran Mishima Zaibatsu, but then Kazuya killed him.
Grandfather?
So they span three generations.
The Mishima bloodline is all about conflict and rebellion.
Fathers and sons hate each other.
So then that means Heihachi...
What exactly is Mutare?
Go, Rocket Fist!
What is this?
You think you're a super hero now?
Maybe in cartoons it is.
This battle is between humans, so humans can stop it.
Which means if my feelings are honest and true, then I'll be able to rescue Shin.
Yes, but are those feelings real or programmed?
You know for a robot, you're kinda cheesy.
You've been sort of quiet since we got back today.
Did getting soaked in the rain make you a bit sad?
Alisa, it isn't the rain.
What is it, then?
I wonder how much more blood with be shed.
Blood?
Mishima blood.
I'm positive it was Heihachi who kidnapped Shin.
I am so out of my league right now.
So three generations are going to fight each other over Shin.
From the data I can access, there's nothing that describes Jin and Kazuya as father and son.
On the contrary, it seems Jin has actually disowned Kazuya as his father.
There's one thing I don't understand, though.
What is it?
Is it wrong for families to fight like this?
I have a father too, you see.
It's the professor who built me.
Part of my embedded programming is to search for him.
But what if my objective...
I doubt it's to fight him.
Chances are he just wants to see you again.
Listen, they're not even human now.
That's really awful.
Xiaoyu?
Alisa, you're just like a refrigerator.
When I was a little girl, I'd press my cheek up to the fridge at home.
It was kinda warm to the touch and the hum was sorta comforting.
How could a refrigerator possibly feel warm?
Believe me, Alisa, it was warm.
Good night and sweet dreams, Xiaoyu.
Sleep well now, my kittens and panda.
Give her a fighting chance.
You're back online now?
Cross referencing Heihachi Mishima and Mutare Experiment.
Three years ago they acquired a genetic research facility.
Searching for specimen transfer locations now.
A tomb?
The Mokujin Exhibit.
I'm afraid your time is up, kiddies.
Kill them!
Enough!
I'm glad my connection was restored.
But I wonder why the feed was suddenly switched back on.
Shin!
It's him!
Lured them here?
What do you mean?
Thanks to you guys, the time has finally come.
World's first immortal cell.
I'm cursed with a body that refuses to die.
Your organizations have hounded me, vying for this power.
But everyone got a little careless.
Jin!
Shin Kamiya.
I knew you would be searching for this body.
All that you want is to stick me under a microscope, so you can have this power for yourself.
You'll want to control it Jin, but you can't.
Like you want to free the devil inside you.
That's the fate for a Mishima man like you, right?
Get to your point.
Kazuya!
Who knew I'd be coming to a kiddy party.
Shin, what are you after?
I'd be glad to finish you.
The stage has been set.
It feels good to be back.
I thought I'd thrown you into the depths of hell.
It makes my blood boil.
Seems you choose your allies poorly.
Heihachi Mishima, you are finally within my reach.
Shin, please stop!
Just be glad you're alive, boy.
I allowed myself to be used to bring you all here.
It's exactly what I planned.
You let them play you like a puppet just to kill me?
So you'd feel my full wrath before you die!
I've failed.
You'd do well to know your place, weakling!
I don't wholly despise this hatred of yours.
I shall claim my vengeance by spilling the blood of Shin Kamiya!
It'll never be yours!
Shin!
You're still here.
I never got the chance to properly thank you two.
But now I can die a human.
Xiaoyu, there has to be something we can do for him.
Jin, it's up to you now.
Wh-what?
I will put an end to this.
Jin.
Just stay outta the way, Xiaoyu.
Three generations gathered for a wonderful family reunion.
Welcome to the bowels of hell!
Your final resting place!
Say hello to the bowels of hell.
He finally proved to be of some use.
Thanks to him, I no longer have to track you down.
So that's the Devil Gene's true form.
The devil gene acts like a catalyst.
It strengthens his cellular compounds to ten times that of a normal human.
They must have experimented on Shin with Kazuya's blood.
And that's the reason Jin wants to end everything.
Is this all you've got?
Where's that power?
What did you do to her?
Alisa!
What have they done?
She has nothing to do with this!
This is not a fight for little girls.
Jin, stop this!
You're finally showing your true self.
This can't be!
Now the devil's power is mine.
Don't think that this is over.
Are you hurt?
Take her to the relief squad.
Relief squad?
You're letting her live?
Who're you?
This house was once my pride and joy.
Tell me, why bother saving her?
Ending the fun so soon would be such a bore, don't you think?
Hatred can be suppressed with reason.
But you must give in to it at times or it will eat you alive.
I can't believe you feel that way, Jin.
It could be by someone more powerful or it could even be you.
I will gladly be the one to step-up and annihilate you!
It would seem the legend was actually true.
As you can see, the legend has finally awoken from its slumber!
Its hatred is so strong, it makes the devil seem weak!
Now die!
Alisa, I can't move anymore.
I'm sorry.
Why are you waiting?
Hurry up and destroy him!
Listen well, Heihachi Mishima.
We Mokujin have learned something.
They have shown us the bonds that exist between humans and their surroundings.
What importance is that?
There is no room for compassion in this fight!
Does your thirst for power know no limits?
I can't believe how he's using the Spirits.
Why do they keep fighting?
It's pointless!
Alisa!
I have to say I've grown rather fond of all of you.
As your refrigerator, I promise to do my best!
Alisa, stop!
What?
This cursed bloodline must end!
Now!
Jin.
This is the human bond they spoke of.
Who'd have guessed.
Xiaoyu?
Know how to achieve world peace?
We should get the whole wide world to turn into one big amusement park.
So then, your dream is a Global Theme Park?
It's like you're speaking in code again.
If I analyze it then, I might spot a weakness in the Devil Gene.
Oh, I get it.
So...the Tekken Tournament, huh?
What?
They really need those eight airline miles?
Credit cards are the downfall of America.
Well, credit cards and Kim Kardashian.
I like her big ass as much as the next man, but don't go give the damn butt a franchise.
Max, I can take a lot.
Please keep your sex life to yourself.
I handled it when I lost my fortune, and I handled it when I lost my fortune.
You said that twice.
Uh, I wasn't even aware they were still making pennies.
I smiled and bent over backwards, giving them service... all for $1.47?
You might want to remember that the next time you leave a waitress pennies.
Looks like this little tip just lost you the chance to give her your little tip.
Yes, I've been knocked down, but now it's time to fight back and grab life by the balls.
I don't know if life likes having its balls grabbed.
Some guys do, but those are usually the ones who want you to spoon them.
You're a simple tool.
You start with a thin, white board...
Your thin, white, and I'm bored.
I've been making vision boards for years, and I always achieve my goals.
And you think it's that crazy little board and not your father's billions?
I never get a restful night's sleep, and I need a good nine hours.
What you need is a good nine inches.
That should be on your vision board.
It is... on the back.
No, that sounds mormon.
Then I want to install a murphy bed in here.
I'm already being taken advantage of at my babysitting job.
Peach has me lugging things back and forth to help with the twins' first birthday party.
I've been sorting through clown resumes for a week.
Peach is throwing a birthday party?
Did you ask her if we can cater the desserts?
You mock the vision board, but look... here it is, our cupcake shop.
I don't think we can both fit in there.
Max, you have to start imagining what our life can be.
You deserve a cupcake shop, and I deserve a new bed.
All you have to do is dream it.
Who is it?
We got your do-it-yourself Murphy bed.
Your "b"s have turned into "c"s, and for that, I give you an "a."
That should be a tip in your inspirational book, which I'm guessing is called cutting pictures out of magazines isn't just for serial killers anymore.
Now you can give one to Peach and throw our hat into the party ring.
Or it sounds delicious.
And the cupcake on the card has a cherry on it.
My cupcakes don't have a cherry... haven't since I was 13.
I can't afford this.
All they drink is breast milk.
Just remember, at 3:00, the twins have their spray tans.
Well, that's exactly how I envisioned that.
Let me see what you're drawing, Johnny.
No, it's an actual rat I saw wearing a hat.
See, when you tend bar till 4:00 a.m., you see a lot of weird stuff.
And when you waitress till 2:00, you see a loser drawing a rat on a napkin.
Well, I got to get back to work.
Pick up... table ten.
- Why?
- It was like my mouth wouldn't let me do it.
That sounds needy, like when someone asks you to come to their one-woman show.
Look at Earl... he has a CD on display.
This is the best saxophone CD you will ever hear... recorded by our cashier Earl Samson.
His music career derailed due to a heroin addiction, but now he's clean and sober and, at 83, still following his dream.
A little lebanese, but that'll clear up in a day or two.
I'm having the worst day.
Jessica Seinfeld stole the Martha Stewart boy.
I am so upset with her.
I thought we were pretending to be friends.
And now I have no one to do the desserts.
Oh, no... this is not okay.
We're not keeping a mattress on the floor.
Oh, is he going to climb up your long blonde hair and rescue you from your murphy-bed tower?
Eh, I don't want to see Johnny.
I had a weird thing with him at the diner last night.
I thought you guys were friends.
I don't know what we are.
He was fake interviewing me with a celery stalk...
'Cause you're both grown-ups.
- I bit it!
- That is weird and humiliating and hot.
He can't come over here.
He'll think I'm dexter.
Don't answer that.
Yes, I'm selfish, and you're Dexter.
How come I never noticed how many there were before?
Why don't you just ask him what the celery moment meant?
I don't want to ask him.
You don't want to ask anybody anything.
So that's what you do with my art.
Just one, and I put it up there.
Right off my back.
You can't help her... she needs to learn a lesson about doing things for herself.
She thinks we're her daddy, and we'll go back on our word, and she'll get a pony.
Hmm, maybe put my glasses on him... get crazy up in this piece!
When you're out there, ask him what the celery meant.
Well, little lady, I reckon a cowboy'd get used to a pretty sweet setup like this.
It's a hard life out on the trails.
Yeah, it's hard for my people, too, since you stole all our land and gave us blankets covered in smallpox.
Cowboys did not say "dag nab it."
Yeah, they did.
"Someone done gone stole my horse, dag nab it."
I think you're thinking "doggone it."
No, "dag nab it"... cowboy.
Which one of us has assless chaps?
When you put the sss... we should get on the horse!
There's got to be a video with a better voice.
You would think after all these years of riding a horse, man would have evolved to have his balls on top instead of underneath.
Life would be so much easier.
Well, yeah, but I don't see a lot of old-timey ladies wanting to get with the top balls.
Are you thinking about the celery?
No, I'm still thinking about my balls.
Now I'm thinking about the celery.
That was weird, right?
Not weird, really... more, um, intense.
Intense good or intense bad?
Me too.
So take your makeup brush, take your mirror, and you want to comb your eyebrows upwards.
What are you doing?
Out the back?
Yeah, it got even weirder.
Or... he didn't grab my... he grabbed my boob.
I just don't know whether it was on purpose.
But I asked, like you told me to, and now I have a weird boob moment to go with my weird celery moment.
So come on over here, and we'll hammer it all out while we hammer this all out.
Come on, this is where you break down and finally help me build the bed.
No, this is where I go to my already-built bed.
What is happening out here?
That's the kind of pounding that's supposed to happen after you're in the bed.
I'm going to sleep on that horrible couch and get bad tips and cry every waitress day for the rest of my life.
Daddy, please.
We need the power drill, 1/4-inch bit, some masonry screws, and a Bear Claw.
I can't believe we did it.
Yeah, it looks pretty good.
Say anything more, and I'll take it down.
I found your card in my baby's room.
That's enough.
Why don't you tell me some of the other events you've done?
Oh, well, we're a start-up company.
The cards... they worked!
This is so inspiring.
Uh, adjust the springs?
No, that's perfect.
You going commando under those corduroys?
No, Max, I am happy today because diner clientele has finally changed for the better.
Look, two parties of cool hipsters are sitting at tables near wall.
You think those are six hipsters?
Okay, let's go over this one more time.
Hipster or homeless pop quiz, ready?
- Ready.
- Hipsters wear?
- The voices in their head.
- Hipsters have?
- Beard and a blog.
I see sadness, there and there.
I'll handle this.
I told you before, I don't want you kind in here.
Take a trendy hike.
He can take one of his special pictures.
That way, when they come back to get it, everyone will have been stiffed.
It's not gonna snow, Earl, it's 50 degrees.
Oh, it's gonna snow, trust me.
I couldn't tell when my first wife was coming, but I can sure tell when a storm is coming.
You're so white, I'm worried we're gonna lose you.
Yeah, that's snow when you're rich.
The only snow angels you'll see this year are the six crack addicts frozen to our stoop.
I was cold and she thought she knew weather patterns.
Oleg, take a picture of your junk on this customer's camera.
Done.
Aren't you gonna ask why?
Yeah, that might have been my fault.
Kind of a shock seeing it for the first time.
It's winter.
You belong in a special home.
I've done some research, and I found a retreat in the Grand Tetons where newly-divorced women come to hug horses to help them gain back their ability to trust.
The only Grand Tetons Chestnut trusts are mine.
Lady, you gotta get a reality check real quick 'cause Earl thinks it's gonna snow.
Earl also thinks the theme from shaft was stolen from a cassette tape he sent out in 1975.
Max, it's not gonna snow.
I know snow.
We owned a ski chalet in Saas-Fee Switzerland and I think I know more than anyone in this restaurant about living in cold climes.
Snow is coming.
Yo, Swiss miss, you wanna have a conversation about cold climes with Snowleg over there?
Why are you wearing two coats?
Well, good morning, world's worst weather girl.
I have never seen so much sunshine.
Earl wrote shaft.
Max, I know it snowed, you don't have to tell me.
I'm surrounded by so much white stuff I'm like Al Pacino in the last scene of Scarface.
It's the hefty 2011 winter collection.
Look at poor Chestnut.
What is he wearing on his hooves?
I cut up my Fendi cashmere leggings.
I grabbed them when we raided the town house.
I thought ahead for me, but not for him.
What is your problem, snow?
I used to love you!
I know their names.
Day James, night James and black James.
They were out of business and I left a note.
What did it say? "I'm loco, gracias."
No, it said, "Sorry I took your roof, hang in there."
I just need to secure this tarp a little.
Looking back, they had so much more than I have now.
What I'm doing is actually kind of brilliant.
Now I'm worried about those houses you built.
Hey, Peach.
Max, I have the most incredible news.
Lawyer finally found a loophole in your prenup?
I wish, no.
I just got an email and I have made it to the final round of casting for Real Housewives of Tribeca.
Real Housewives of Tribeca?
The producers are on their way over and I want everything to be perfect when they see Brad and Angelina.
She's gained 25 pounds in one year.
Yeah, 'cause she started at zero.
I thought she was your bestie.
She is, but my bestie's a bitchy.
That's crazy bitchy.
So now, I'm looking up handicapped animals to impress the producers.
Oh, you want a handicapped animal?
I got your handicapped animal.
I know a homeless horse with gender identity issues.
What if I told you that this horse was a celebrity horse?
How do you know Caroline Channing?
She's my AA sponsor.
Makes sense.
Well, I'd have to meet Caroline first.
Bring her by on Saturday.
Max, what an amazing idea.
Are you high?
No, I couldn't find my bedroom stash since you moved everything around.
She'll pay for the fancy stable and we'll go and hug Chestnut for her whenever we want.
You just need to go meet her and it's done.
Why is getting rid of Chestnut so easy for you?
Didn't you ever have a pet as a child?
Look, pets are not my thing, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right, I should be more positive.
I don't suppose there's any way you took a giant dump on your dresser?
After wearing your leggings, he's getting ready for his fame audition.
He's a maniac, maniac on all fours.
It says on their website that their horses are featured in commercials and films!
Can you say Chestnut, star of the war horse sequel?
Did you take the weed from my bedside table?
Honestly... a little.
Close that and go to sleep.
No, I'm still reading.
Oh look at that, I just pulled down your browser history.
Interesting list.
Kitten plays a keyboard, kitten sneezes and farts at the same time?
It's a kitten ringing a doorbell!
He's trying to get in like people.
You have a secret soft spot for animals.
No, I'm just into freaky kittens.
There's one who puts on a snakeskin suit and goes on a business trip.
You're gonna miss him when he's gone.
Damn it, turn us around Max, we have to enter again.
This is the third time.
Like I haven't done enough for you.
Well, here he is.
And as we discussed, Chestnut is a champion jumper his dressage is impeccable, he's ribboned three times at the Hampton Classic, and he comes from a historically elite line of distinguished show horses.
And he pees like a civil rights fire hose.
Max, step further back.
Come on, let's cut to the chase.
He's nice, brown, he looks sick in leggings, and he's free, so take him or leave him.
When'd you say he was a jumper?
From 2005 to 2010.
He was in a class by himself.
Well, maybe he was a jumper, but he isn't anymore.
Well, you have a gut.
He's the one who's getting personal going after Chestnut like that.
Okay, you tell me, when's the last time he's exercised?
When's the last time you exercised?
Wow, show business is rough.
All right, it's Tony, right?
Last time I checked.
All right, Tony, you'll have to forgive her.
She really loves him and wants this to work out.
Bottom line is, even a free horse isn't free.
I still have to feed him and take care of him and truth be told, this horse isn't gonna make me a penny.
If my film guy comes in here, he's gonna pick that beauty over this one.
Come on, let's go.
You know, maybe next time before you let someone ride five Miles across Brooklyn in a toxic, Russian, cologne-soaked rent-a-fur, you should be clear that the film business, even for horses, is ageist and elitist.
And, yes, we may have seen better days, but with hard work, determination and a little luck, one day we'll be back on top.
Yeah, and I'm not impressed by your big star pony over there.
Besides, she'll probably think it's a look.
All right, I know this one on one with Peach isn't your ideal scenario, but it's what's best for Chestnut so man up and face reality.
You might be ready to face reality, but are you ready to face reality TV?
Are you kidding me?
Fabulous, this is awesome, just awesome.
No, if I made Chestnut parade around and be humiliated in public, then I have to be willing to do the same.
Here, hold my coat.
You always have those with you?
Yes, I'm from Manhattan.
Thank me for coming, that's what people did all the time when I was a billionaire.
Thank you for coming.
No, thank you for inviting me.
Wow, that's so cool.
Rich people always pretend to know each other.
Caroline, thank you for coming.
No, thank you for inviting me.
I'm proud of you.
No, I'm proud of you.
I just got the chills again.
He likes this place.
Yeah, it's almost worth you being humiliated on reality TV.
What?
Old money don't sign.
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
Maybe I should come home and live with my best friend, Max.
What about Caroline?
She can sleep under the tarp.
So I guess you found your weed.
Okay, I'll see you soon, Chestnut.
This is way more than most horses get out of me.
I wasn't even this upset when they discontinued tan mms.
And when everything sucked, you were the best thing we had going.
Max, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'll always be fine.
Are you crying?
Yeah, I'm crying, 'cause I wish I could live here.
Don't worry, we'll come visit, and we'll find a way to bring him home in the spring.
You know exactly what to say to cheer a broke sista up.
And when we get home, I found a video of a kitten singing Bruno Mars.
Max, feedback from customers is very important business tool.
Earl, here's your brandy.
Okay, we're good now.
Max and I still have to get home and bake cupcakes for tomorrow.
"dark-haired waitress..." - hey!
"I'd like to ride the blonde waitress like a tilt-a-whirl."
You are lying.
So this is how you tell me what you think of me?
You hide behind outdated method of feedback?
What, I should've posted twitpic of my face like this?
Maybe I will send you a twitpic of my meatloaf.
Do not tell me what to do.
Now this is starting to sound like earl time.
I didn't know baking cupcakes was an extreme sport.
It's like the deadliest batch.
Only mexican girls would talk to me.
Then he'll ask us stuff like "who are you?
We're so poor I have a sock that I refer to as my good sock.
Wait, it's other people's money.
What?
Uh, yeah, you're not the only one with a secret stash.
That's right, I said purple.
Great, we'll get this one.
I think the funny gas is gone.
- Did it light?
- No, but my foot is on fire.
Let me see, which ring should I sell?
I got this one when I was 18.
Sal!
I know how to get the full value of the ring.
The customer asked for crust off of a turkey club.
Why don't you see for yourself, ratatouille?
Every woman knows size doesn't matter.
I like your shirt.
Reminds me of the side of the van I lost my virginity in.
That little man disrespect me.
He insult my food, my english, my "hyjane."
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
A hug would help.
You did.
- Hate you!
So jealous!
- Thanks!
But I couldn't take it back without a receipt.
Caroline, it's not your fault.
That's awful.
Surprised to see me working here?
It's halfway there.
Oh, can I see the receipt?
You wouldn't want me to lose my job again, would you?
I got this, donna.
- You don't know what a pop-up sale is?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
What are you doing, beautiful mind?
- Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.
hold the elevator!
Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.
Hard to forget such beautiful names.
Come on, don't waste my time!
- I don't know, it just is.
Are you here for the pop-up sale?
Caroline?
We have lunch reservations for five at Four Seasons at 3:00.
Why are you asking me?
Where is she going?
I thought you two were a team.
Apparently not.
Because I could've sworn you didn't know me.
I didn't want those girls telling everyone that Caroline Channing was in a bathroom selling her jewelry.
Max, I am in this for the long haul.
- You lit the pilot light?
What the... how did it get...
Spent it on the oven, next-day delivery fee and installation.
So I went to every gold store in Brooklyn, leveraged their offers against each other until I got enough to buy the Bluestar.
You didn't have to do that.
And our future means more to me than rings from my past.
I told you, I'm in this for the long haul.
For the record, I hated lunch with those girls.
If you unzip my shirt, I'm gonna be pissed!
Impressed, but pissed.
Again.
It was coupon night and I was trampolining your wife.
You're a real comedian, aren't you, Snow?
Well, I guess that's why they call it the punch line.
You don't like me, do you?
What happened in that room in New York?
What happened in that room?
- Yeah, he was Asian.
I can have Rupert bludgeon you all night.
I'm being beaten up by a guy called Rupert?
What happened with the Colonel?
Shit.
And that's when you showed up.
We had the Colonel under surveillance.
Did he tell you this before or after you killed him?
- That's not what happened.
Nah, I'm trying to give them up.
Shoot Langral?
- Anything else?
Tell me who the backup guy was.
Well, I guess this conversation's over.
It's good to see you.
They check this damn thing five times a year.
So, what have we got?
He claims he was set up.
What a mess!
So what do you want us to do about him?
M.S. One has been a very successful experiment with the first 500 test cases serving time without incident.
M.S. One is the only Supermax facility in existence where there is no physical or sexual abuse, breakouts or riots.
Because you put the prisoners to sleep?
It's called stasis.
Of course, but there are a few issues with stasis, are there not?
Aggression due to damage of the cortex, dementia, psychosis.
Those were early teething problems.
The defense system is automatic and solar assisted, oxygen-fed, auto lock, 100-millimeter pacifiers made by Milland aerospace.
LM22, please transmit clearance.
What are they doing?
Parts of M.S. One are still under construction and need constant maintenance.
In the event of a problem, they will beep and flash yellow.
Would you please take the elevator to the third floor?
Mr. Barnes, isn't M.S. One's true purpose to test the effects of deep space exploration on humans?
I've heard that urban legend.
Of course.
But is it purely coincidental that one of the main sources of funding is a deep space exploration company?
We're going to put on a little show.
And let's just hope that when you sign off on this place, we can all get back to making the world a better place.
After you, ma'am.
This is General Population.
Jesus.
I'm here to tell you the good news, Snow.
Yeah, I'm dying to.
And nothing about a constitutional right to a fair hearing?
I'm looking forward to it.
Sweet dreams.
I don't know about you, but I can't drive home.
Are you experiencing any disorientation?
I can't see out of that eye anymore.
And what happened to your face, did you burn it?
Fifty-three counts?
I've a very familiar face.
You're wearing perfume, aren't you?
He's got a gun!
Stay there.
No.
Easy!
Leave it.
Sorry!
She's fine, according to her telemetry, but the situation is critical.
We can have special forces up there on site within six hours.
To do what exactly?
I just mean, what order do we give, Mr. President?
Now we can send in the Marines, but we have no real idea of the whereabouts of your daughter on board.
I'd rather castrate myself with blunt rocks.
Wait.
Frank's lighter.
Here, put this on.
How do we know she's not dead already?
It'll guide you to the pod and give you the access code.
The pod will take the two of you off M.S. One.
- What's that for?
You join those two ends, you got a nine-second charge.
It's grade two, for opening heavy secure panels or bulkheads.
Bulkheads?
I gotta get out of here.
Anyone else?
I'm gonna need a doctor to get this stitched up.
Thank you.
Stitch it up.
We're taking over.
And who are you?
Secret Service.
I didn't hear anything about this.
That will be why they call it secret, right?
What's happening?
This is Special Agent Scott Langral and I'm in charge of this situation.
Let me know when you've picked up on it, won't you?
When I want your opinion, I'm gonna give it to you.
Far be it from me to teach you how to suck eggs, but you'd think they might have said something.
He was about to say something.
He was about to say something like...
Hey, tell me you are not still thinking of negotiating with these psychos.
Hey, easy, easy, big guy-
For the time being, sure.
Can I talk to you privately for a minute?
Now, you look like a smart guy, so I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
You, maybe five or six others, can get out of here.
You know why they really ask for a hostage, don%you?
A wounded woman's always popular.
Okay, we got eight principals, four low-vel riot shotguns, three Berettas, low-vel semis.
You choose.
Honey, you'll be fine.
Don't say that.
Bring them back inside.
Come on, Emilie, let's go.
Why don't we just kill that lunatic?
Because he's my brother.
You need to look around and you should see a sealed port.
Snow, can you hear me?
Warnock?
There you are.
Come on.
Snow, what's going on?
Actually, bring me two.
So, I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.
You all right?
No.
Hopefully, this will short-circuit me the inevitable "it can't be done" discussion.
I need this door open.
Yeah.
Okay, I need you to take it.
And then, when you're over, you gotta go straight ahead.
And here's where it gets a little bit tricky.
What do you want me to do, fly?
'Cause I think I left my cape at home.
Snow, there is no time for hanging around.
What is that?
Snow, can you hear me?
Reactivate the torsion.
What is that?
- They're trying to get it open.
- Can they do that?
This may take a bit longer.
That really is unfortunate.
Okay, so that was easy, right?
Your two minutes start now.
Shoot me if you want, but I can guarantee this open if you give me five minutes.
Good sales pitch.
Okay, Emilie, listen to me very carefully.
Nitrogen is lighter than oxygen, so there will be more at floor level.
I'm sorry.
Hot girl on the floor, big hole in her leg.
Fifteen seconds.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, and so far I think I prefer you that way.
Shit.
Watch your head.
Take the next left.
Okay, this way.
You're almost there, buddy.
Find a way to get me back in because we're flying blind here.
I thought you said you were sure.
You're really a lot of fun, you know that?
Asshole.
So, well, we lost them, huh?
Right.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Who sent you?
What did he say?
About my father.
Oh, yeah, I made that other bit up.
Are you the only type of jerk they found for this kind of mission?
I came here to rescue you and mission accomplished.
And quite well, I might add.
Are you just thrilled being yourself all day or is it a part-time job?
They will die if we leave them.
We are not leaving them.
Listen, it's really very sweet of you, but there's not a lot of room for anybody else, okay?
It's kind of a VIP deal, get it?
This is the plan you agreed on with my father?
Which way's north?
Thanks.
You're doing great.
Can I have your attention?
Watch everywhere.
Here, give me the map.
North.
- They don't come in pink.
You can't walk past 500 whack jobs dressed like a chick.
You can't smoke in here.
All evidence to the contrary.
- What's your name?
- Snow.
Your name is Snow Snow?
Engine oil, coffee, some water I just got out of the toilet.
And just what do you plan on doing with it?
I plan on putting it in your hair.
Not on your life.
God, stop!
it stinks!
Wasn't that fun?
- You're a pig.
- Thank you.
Yeah, you look good.
Don't know what you're talking about.
You tell Warnock that we have his daughter.
And unless we get what we want, you tell your boss that I've got 500 pent-up convicts all too eager to educate his little girl.
We're going on a hunting trip.
Nothing.
And what if this doesn't work?
Well, then we're probably gonna die.
That is hardly my fault.
Dude, you're a dude, okay?
Like the spray?
No, not like the spray.
Shit!
Can I help you?
You don't know the password.
Then there's a penalty.
The door's jammed!
Here, shoot them, will you?
Jesus, I thought you were a Democrat.
Come on, he's like 35.
Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby...
Shit.
I need you to get me something.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
Okay, come on.
- Oh, God!
God damn it!
Well, that's that then.
Looks like your little PR trip got all screwed up.
I came here to ensure that people were being treated fairly and decently, unlike yourself.
You know, it's easy to be a saint with nothing on the line.
You wait till you've got a serious sacrifice to make and then you'll find out who you really are.
But not you, right?
It was controlled by a geo-orbital technician.
They blew him out an airlock.
What's the bottom line?
Can you get me a secure line to Jack Tallis at Justice?
Bingo.
That's not a rescue mission.
Come on.
I thought you said there were two seats.
- Where's the other one?
- We don't have time for this, okay?
- You are going in the other pod, right?
- I'll be right behind you, don't worry.
Promise me.
Yeah, okay, I promise.
What is your first name?
Your deadbeat friend did it.
This your idea of keeping a promise?
My father won't authorize an attack with me still here.
Have you actually met your father?
Mace told me where the case is.
- Bullshit.
- It was the last thing he said.
Really?
So where is it?
You help me, I help you.
Come on!
Or are you all mouth, no trousers?
I'm a lot of trousers, okay?
Emilie, don't.
Stop killing people.
Level three.
Thank you.
I just needed you to help me.
Liars everywhere these days it seems.
Don't move.
God, I hate that.
Hello, you two.
Do you know what you've done?
Turn on the comms.
Did we manage to make contact with our friend?
Or I will set my brother onto you.
Dad?
Everyone's dead.
So be it.
Promises, sweetheart.
Leave her be.
That's it, then.
Sir, you need to authorize an assault.
Emilie's still on the station.
I know this might be difficult, sir, but she's just one hostage.
Then you know that I cannot authorize that.
Already signed.
You son of a bitch!
You said that was your promise to me!
We've a serious problem and you're shouting about this?
You made me look stupid.
Every time I dig us out...
Mommy said you speak too much.
Who's gonna look after you now?
You're back.
Yeah, well, I wasn't busy.
Take a right!
I really hate heights.
Now you're asking a crazy man where he hid a briefcase.
That's not what happened.
There's something that we need to do.
I'm good.
How's the girl?
And that you didn't get the thing you needed.
No, no, I got it.
No, I mean the briefcase.
I don't understand.
Right.
Does the number even matter, Snow?
I hope they put you away for a long time.
You know, I don't think they will.
You of all people know that they like to keep all these kind of things on the down-low.
That was from Frank.
So, all this trouble for an empty briefcase.
Good job.
I know something about you.
Amazing what you can find out as First Daughter in old Army documents.
My old man was a big John Wayne fan.
Must have been tough on the playground.
That's why I'm so lovable.
Looks like you're a free man.
Thanks to you.
What kind of Robin Hood would I be if I didn't stop to rescue Maid Marion once in a while?
What the hell was that for?
I owed you that.
I really feel we need to continue this on an equitable basis.
You know, for a minute there, I thought you were going to kiss me.
Where's the entourage?
Gave them the slip.
- Have you to thank for teaching me that.
You know, I've got this feeling your old man's not going to approve of this.
Oh, no.
And that is how a baby antelope comes into the world.
The window, obviously, would be...
Oh, hey, Principal Betcher.
You were serious about that?
Oh, yeah, dead serious.
- That was 10 years ago.
- Feels like eight, though, right?
You got bus duty today.
Not true.
Yesterday was Sunday.
Just get to work, okay?
Mr. Voss?
Yeah, that's some very advanced, college-y stuff.
Look, if you're done with your work, just go sit down and draw on your desk like Martinez.
But I want to know.
And I don't know if you heard Mr. Betcher or not, but, technically, this is my vacation time now.
So I'm going to shut her down for a few.
Bonus.
Here we go!
Second violins, don't overpower the first violins.
That's why you're called "second".
I hear improvement coming in the door.
Nice and subtle.
And you're done.
Mr. Streb.
Oh, right, the quote of the day.
"Without music, life would be a mistake."
You were great today.
Listen, I have a huge favor to ask.
I have bus duty, and I was...
See, the thing is, my Aunt Cora, she threw her hip out again.
It's a nasty hip-out thing.
And these pins and rods, they're not even connected to anything, they're just loose.
Well, it depends what she looks like.
My wife is pregnant.
How old are you?
Old.
It's beautiful.
Can we take our seats, people?
Please take your seats.
How much food do you think is stuck in that beard?
I don't know, but I can see corn from here.
You asked me, and I said no.
- You said three.
- Yeah, but, you know, actually, it's pretty hard to see your watch when you've been crying.
Okay, giving you one last chance here.
You've already given me 15 last chances, Scott.
Starting immediately, we'll be freezing all supplies, and, unfortunately, we have to roll back to last year's pay scales.
Also, despite best efforts, we are cutting all extracurricular activities, which includes the debate club, the music program, the annual senior class field trip...
How about all the money we raised in the car wash or the silent auction?
"Verbis defectis musica incipit."
That's Latin for, "Music takes us where word cannot."
I mean, what about the athletic program?
Those football players, they get new jerseys every year.
Are you aware that the Booster Club alone accounts for one-third of our charitable donations?
This is a budget question.
And I just need a little bit of that budget.
I've got 60 kids with dented instruments.
Excuse me?
Why don't you not tell me how to do my job?
Okay, and then why don't you tell him the truth?
This is how we got thrown out of softball.
Oh, and what would that be?
You are wasting everyone's time.
Bring it.
Really?
No, I'll tell you what's crossing the line, firing a man who's having a baby.
They don't know that I'm talking about you necessarily.
Congratulations.
$48,000.
So, as I was saying, we have no choice but to make these cuts.
Yeah, or raise the money.
Oh, and who's going to do that?
We will.
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.
My mind was racing.
And I bought you a coffee.
That's great.
So, what do you think about this?
Is that too risqué?
You know, I think we should probably just wing it.
Well, the meeting doesn't start till 5:00.
It's 5:15.
Well, then you're late, like everybody else.
Where do you think they are?
You are, absolutely.
I'm feeling good about this.
There's no one in the cafeteria, is there?
Just that janitor that talks to himself.
I guess it was unrealistic to think that anybody would show up when everybody has their own problems.
You showed up.
You shut up.
I said, "You showed up."
But I got to say, it's really nice what you're doing for Marty.
He's so passionate about what he does.
This school needs more people like him, not less.
So, what exactly is the plan?
But we have a plan, we go, "We got to get to here by then."
Not a chance.
You dunk a basketball?
Where are you going?
Nightmares.
0 for 17.
I'll tell you, this chili is amazing, guy.
It's got an incredible kick.
So, listen, you really have no extra work?
- No, no one's hiring right now.
Eric, tell Mary Shannon to get off the freaking phone!
Mary Shannon, get off the freaking phone!
I could have done that!
And where the heck is Peter?
He was supposed to be in the tub 10 minutes ago!
Dad, can I watch The World's Deadliest Car Chases?
Sorry, buddy.
I got some money stacked away that she don't know about.
Look, I appreciate it, but I need a lot more than that.
Mom, Dad's betting again!
All right, guess who's not getting a hamster.
What about that citizenship class you used to teach at night?
You, middle one, upstairs now.
Hey, and stop putting Raisinets up your brother's nose, okay?
Dad says it's funny.
What are you doing?
You disgust me.
- Mission accomplished.
Okay, question number three, "Women such as Susan B. Anthony
You know what, let's let them finish up the Serenity Prayer.
Living one day at a time...
Miguel.
To be in pain?
No, "suffrage" is the right to do something.
The right to not feel pain.
We are definitely off track here.
The right to vote?
I'm sorry, you got something to say?
But let's give it a shot anyway.
Okay, good.
Sure, what's up?
Niko!
I'll move some things around and maybe we can sit down later tonight, all right?
You are the best!
There he is!
- Koen, Nard, this is Scott.
The ferret, the ferret.
Hang your coat right there.
Should we study or...
Since the first day he entered the Octagon, we knew Ken Dietrich was something special.
My partner as always, Joe Rogan.
You hold for bets.
Did you ever fight?
No, no, I wrestled in college.
And it is all over!
He took his 10 grand and ran off like a Shetland pony!
- But he lost.
Yeah, if he won, it would've been 50.
Okay, next fight.
Mixed Martial Arts?
Do you even know how to do that?
I was a really good wrestler in college.
Lose.
This is the best chance you got.
But don't worry, next week, you're gonna be in great hands with a new teacher, and he's gonna be...
No, I am new, okay...
So, I'm citizen?
Man, I can't believe you would quit on me like this.
I'm citizen.
You know how important this is to me.
You're kidding?
But there are guys that run marathons well into their 80s.
Not when they're being punched in the face.
Come on, you said it yourself, wrestlers make great fighters.
And you know, when I was younger, I took judo.
There's no way you can fight.
Look, you don't want to train me, that's fine.
But we started this thing and we're not gonna stop until you're a citizen, okay?
You start in the cage.
There's a small-time show this weekend.
His name is Sergio, but I'm going to switch it up.
- Something wrong?
Okay, hold it for a minute.
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna learn any of this stuff.
Okay, so based on your limited experience fighting girls, how?
That's why all the gladiators entered the Colosseum with all that thundering music.
Actually, they do that in the UFC.
Exactly.
And you're gonna follow in the footsteps of all those great warriors.
Every one of them had a distinctive musical theme that put fear in the hearts of their opponents, which rendered them defeated even before their match began.
- No, I know what I'm doing.
Change behind the tarp.
No, no, no, I'm doing this for you.
Is that a chicken?
This looks like a Civil War hospital.
Lookie, look who showed up.
You're not as smart as I thought you were.
Hey, this is bottom-level MMA.
No, but I want to be clean.
You ready?
You better be, because you're next.
Watch this.
Intimidation!
Come on, guys, you ready?
Fight!
Is this the best plan you could come up with?
Fighting in a cage?
As much as I enjoyed teaching future Americans for eight bucks an hour, it wasn't getting the job done.
You smell really good, by the way...
Gee whiz, what's with the...
What would I say to Marty?
He'll understand.
He saw you get knocked out cold.
I wasn't out cold, all right?
I'll talk to him.
Hi, can I help you?
You must be Molie.
And I didn't see him after school, and I was wondering if he's around.
No, he had a private lesson.
We're turning the music room into a nursery.
That goes right in the vault, by the way, and it's like a, it's like a vault, locked down, Fort Knox or some sort of prison.
He didn't tell you?
No. ls there something wrong that's going on at the school?
No, no, nothing bad at all.
Last week, they installed a metal detector in the teachers' lounge, 'cause...
Well, is there a message I can give him for you?
- Nice meeting you.
Tell Betcher not to cut anything.
We're saving Marty's job.
That's 750.
That's the first installment right there.
- Scott?
I played French horn in the marching band.
I loved wearing that big hat, shiny white spats, the smell of the grass.
Those were some good times.
Worthy attack, everybody!
No, that was Disco Street Fighting.
Don't worry, with you, we're gonna do the real stuff.
Let's work on some takedown defense.
I wrestled, I think I know how to stop a shot.
Ding, ding, boom, boom, elbow, elbow, boom!
Liver shot, bang, bang, bang!
You got the point.
We need to keep you out of dangerous situations.
Now, to escape the Rear-Naked Choke, you want to break the grip, pull the arm down and move to the side.
Escape.
Escape!
Wrong way, wrong way.
Okay, you're vulnerable like a puppy.
I'm out.
I'm free.
I'm bored.
No helmet?
Hey, it's okay to be afraid.
That last knockout, never happened.
Three migraines a week say you're wrong.
It is weird.
And now, my friends, let's meet his opponent here at the pier.
- Time-out?
There's no time-outs, guy.
Come on, let's go.
Put your hands up!
Come on, defense!
Ref, take a point!
Would you come on?
Man, are you okay?
He just kicked my left nut into my throat.
Where's my stool?
We didn't have a stool last fight.
I didn't make it out of the first round last fight.
I can't do this.
What are you doing?
Yeah, that's exactly the message you're sending him.
Hey, you can't lay down, man.
- All right, let's go, fella.
Next time, bring the stool.
Keep those hands up!
Watch out!
Pull him in close.
Okay, that's right, push him away.
- I'm trying.
Defense.
Okay, it's raining. it's over.
- This is stupid.
Fighter, are you ready?
Are you ready, chief?
Perfect.
All right, pencils down, people.
When I moved here, I didn't know English.
I had to learn everything all over again, you know?
So I used songs and stuff to learn.
Besides Filipino, the only language I knew was music.
Malia, it makes perfect sense.
I don't want to quit it.
Then you got to tell him that.
But it's not.
Come on, Mr. Voss.
You said it yourself.
Learning this stuff doesn't matter.
I got to go.
Okay, what are the three branches of government?
The thing is that it's not here.
No, no, no, no, no, don't count that.
Wait, wait, you forgot my oatmeal?
Well, I brought the stool.
- I got to eat, man.
Yeah, three branches of government.
You see it back there, Niko?
- It's on the back.
- Yeah, yeah, got it.
Come on, three branches of government, buddy.
Is there cinnamon in this?
No.
Not even close.
No!
- All right, here we go.
They didn't come for us yet.
Let me see what's going on.
This is my song.
This is him. it's his song.
Hey, he's got the same song.
Well, tonight, he's bringing the boom.
Look, we both can't have the same song.
Come on, we got to get ready, guys.
No, no, you gotta get me another song.
- I got it.
Okay, again, not close.
What the heck is this?
Holly Holy, Neil Diamond.
Went platinum in 1969.
Who cares?
Everybody up!
It's the Scott Man!
No, no!
Defense!
Come on, Scott!
Don't grab the fence!
I'm not even grabbing the fence!
Defense, buddy!
Come on!
- It's legal. it's legal.
Sit down.
Tie this guy up.
Protect yourself.
Keep your hands up!
Come on, close the gap, buddy!
I'm so sorry.
Who leaves applesauce on the rear dash, out in the hot sun?
You know, better question, who among us who isn't Amish makes their own applesauce?
We did it.
It's unbelievable!
Okay, everybody, just take your seats.
Can you keep it down?
You're famous.
What?
Everybody in the music department is talking about it.
Mr. Streb told us that you were doing this for us.
And I got to say, you're a hero.
Hero?
It's not sprained. it's just a bruise.
Good, 'cause I gotta fight tomorrow.
I'm going to have to start charging you.
So, how much money have you made so far?
Three grand.
What's this?
$72 from my bake sale.
I had to do something.
I got to give it to you. it's been a long time since I felt any kind of energy in this school.
Yeah?
We?
Oh, so it's the system that's creating teachers who just don't care.
It was so stupid.
No, it's not.
I think I would have liked you better when you were that stupid.
- Why do you always turn me down?
Do you even know that every time you've asked me out, you've done it from a seated position?
- It's too dangerous.
- Fast.
This is me seeing if you're worth my time.
Is it hot in here?
- You good with that?
- Both.
- Come on, I can't fight two guys.
Your boy is good, but he's got no offense, man.
You know, he's a wrestler, and he picks up fast, and he's tough.
This is going to be funny.
Yeah, those are hits.
Come on, give him a break.
All right, boys, that's good.
Boom, there we go.
From Genesis 32:24.
Jacob was tough, man.
By sunrise, he had won the Lord's respect.
Let's eat, boys.
That Superman Punch, Mel, that was awesome.
I can't lift my arms.
Last time I went to the hospital, it actually cost me more than I made in the fight, so you got to help me.
But I would have to reset it.
- Easy, okay?
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.
That was fun, no?
Good night, Scott.
Come on in.
Close the door.
Sit down.
I'd like you to meet Malta's father, Mr. De La Cruz.
How are you?
Who the hell do you think you are, Mr. Voss?
Telling my daughter to disobey me?
What's this all about?
It's about our teachers not promoting dangerous situations.
And believe me, I wouldn't be doing it if you'd been doing your job.
Did you really think that you could save the music program by doing this?
You know why I did this in the first place?
I'm not even that good of a fighter.
I'm out there getting my ass kicked.
Believe me, this wasn't Plan A, but I don't know what else to do.
And that is the problem.
And then I got to roll around with a sweaty guy from Holland.
What's going on, Mr. Voss?
Biology, Derrick.
Fair enough.
Anyone know what happens to a stagnant cell?
Malia.
It's not good.
Did you hear that?
It ain't good.
And here's the good news, all that decays can be restored.
Is this hitting anybody?
Like how a cut heals.
Brian, my man.
"Hey, don't do that!" "Hey, that's my friend."
"You don't even know him!" "You don't know me either!"
So now, even if the entire system is close to dead, what happens?
Come on, man.
What do you say?
If all the cells work together, what will happen?
The entire system is healed.
Exactly.
You look as good going as you do coming.
And you, my friend, sat in gum.
Please be gum.
Okay, so how many years is a term of the president?
A president serves a term of two years?
- Okay, what's your favorite song?
- My favorite song?
Faithfully.
The Journey song?
Yes.
They don't make them like that anymore, right?
- Yeah, right.
You are unbelievable.
Oh, nice head movement, yeah!
Don't lose your grip!
One voice.
So if I was to let you cook for me, and I'm not saying I am, what would you cook?
Hey, which one of these should I go with?
Volcano or Enigma?
Hey, what are you doing?
You know what, I'm just gonna go with both, let 'em fight it out.
Fight, boys!
I haven't seen you like this in years.
- What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
It wasn't my dream.
You got to go after your dreams, Eric.
I mean, if you don't make an effort, nothing's ever gonna change.
You think?
Absolutely.
You got to find your passion and then let it guide you, let it envelop...
Here you go.
Wow, this is beautiful.
You know, you picked a very delicate dish.
The sauce there is extremely, it's delicate.
It's incredible.
Coq au vin is of Turkish descent.
No. it's French.
No, the name is French.
Hence the name, Turkey. it's all fowl...
If I didn't tap out, he's gonna break my arm, so that's what you do.
Good night, Scott.
Yep, okay.
Well, this was a nice dinner.
Sorry about the lamp.
I got something for you.
I had a situation!
You're a situation!
You got to wash your face first.
Hey, what's up?
It's 10 grand.
To lose?
He what?
Relax.
Hey, why would you pass on the UFC?
You're not ready for a fight like this.
You realize we're six grand away and the semester's almost over?
You know, maybe we should...
You're a schoolteacher, Scott!
I devoted my whole life to fighting.
And you should've been given this shot.
I was good, Scott.
And during training, I just destroyed my neck.
That was it.
Over.
Look, if you don't think I deserve this fight, you know what, I'm not gonna take it.
No, you deserve it.
It's just me. it's...
I'll set this up.
I want to thank you for your help.
Business has never been better.
I showed Dana White some of your fights, and I was there at the Romero fight.
Great job when you put him down.
I have created some delicious lettuce wraps, prepared with very little oil and a hint of ginger.
Thanks.
Actually, best eaten while hot, so...
Yeah, we're gonna...
Get out of here.
The UFC had a fighter fall out last minute in an undercard fight against Ken Dietrich in Las Vegas next week.
Dana's a little worried you might throw up on him.
No, no, that was a one-time deal.
I'm telling you, it was some bad applesauce that got away from me.
And I think what you're doing is awesome, and the UFC agrees.
We'd like to give you a shot.
Now, Niko, you had some concerns?
He's ready.
Okay, good.
I'm gonna grab one of these lettuce things, and I'll see you boys in Vegas.
- You got yourself a fight!
- I really do.
Sure.
He's my hero.
Mine, too.
Thank you.
All right, you gonna wish me luck or what?
Please be careful.
Niko says this guy you're fighting is really dangerous.
Look, I'm going in there, I'm gonna lose the fight, get my 10 grand, and I'm getting out.
So, bring it in.
What is that?
Cherry cheesecake, guy.
You eat this crap and you'll be lethargic.
Look, we represent the UFC.
Let's act like it's not our first time to the dance, okay?
No claws, no claws.
Elkins was arrested today.
What?
Oh, it's horrible.
He took it, Scott.
There's nothing to fight for anymore.
Nothing to fight for?
I mean, everyone's quit on these kids.
I don't want you to get hurt.
What am I teaching them if I don't?
Bye.
Okay, bye.
Joe Rogan, my partner, that is a great fight.
Fantastic matchup.
We also have a very interesting UFC debut tonight.
Scott Voss, a biology teacher from Boston.
Now, here's the good news, he was a Division 1 college wrestler.
Here's the bad news, that was 20 years ago, and he's facing Ken "The Executioner" Dietrich.
Let's get UFC 176 under way.
Voss and Dietrich, what a great story.
It sounds different.
Yeah, it does sound different.
Come here.
You're not gonna believe this.
Be safe.
Good song, man.
Good song. it's a scary song.
You go first.
Ladies and gentlemen, this fight is three rounds in the UFC Heavyweight Division.
Introducing first, fighting out of the red corner, out of Boston, Massachusetts, Scott Voss!
And when the action begins, our referee in charge, Herb Dean.
Hey, take it to the ground as fast as possible.
How much do I get if we win?
What are you saying?
Holy smoke.
Let's do it.
Here we go!
Oh, huge Superman Punch right out of the gate!
Cover up!
Big hooks to the body and the head!
Dietrich is swarming him!
Cover up, Scott!
Dietrich is lethal on the ground.
You need to get on top, Scott!
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
Scott Voss is in pure survival mode.
Oh, my goodness!
No question about it.
I'm having a crazy month of meeting people.
Man, so you want to fight in the UFC?
Everything you taught me, he knows better.
And, Joe, Scott Voss has got to do something different.
Fight!
Round two under way.
Big counter.
Checks the kick.
Oh, Showtime Kick!
The Executioner may finish this fight right here.
Get out from under him!
Come on, Scott, pull him on you!
Dietrich clearly is trying to get him out of there early, but I am just amazed that Voss can take all this.
Wrong corner, guy.
Scott, listen to me, you've got to stay away from him.
Okay, he's got to go back to the ground.
I'd really like to say something.
- It's the lesser of two evils.
You've already done it.
I got to be honest, it's a little blurry right now.
Then let me tell you what you would see.
You would see a bunch of our students witnessing complete resolve in the face of an unbearable obstacle.
They are invested.
Scott, they're inspired.
That's what we're supposed to do as teachers, right?
Inspire.
You can quit right now, and everything that we worked for will have been accomplished.
Third and final round.
He looks really comfortable here in round three.
Dietrich reverses him here.
Oh, he kicks him off!
Dietrich is in trouble.
Oh, now Voss is in trouble!
Put him out of his misery!
Oh, they are exchanging like Don Frye and Takayama!
Dietrich is hurt bad, Mike!
He's got him up!
This is crazy!
Landing punches on Dietrich.
Oh, Voss is in trouble here, Mike!
This is not good for Scott Voss.
He's got to keep those hands clasped together.
He can't let go of that grip.
Hold on tighter!
No!
Oh, Voss is in a lot of trouble here.
He may tap.
Oh, he's got him up!
Scott Voss by knockout.
When you think about the dedication this guy has shown, the sacrifices and the risks he made, all for those kids, that guy is a hero.
I am.
One down.
Go down one, this one.
You are powerful!
Is there anybody better?
Thank you, Scott.
Your donation was more than generous.
It's going to keep our school in the black for quite some time.
Hey, could I get that vacation day back?
Not a chance.
I citizen!
I citizen two times!
And I'll still be in love with you.
It's that way that you....
It's the way that you....
-No, I don't know.
We'll finally find one, and we'll get here and we won't know anybody so we just stand around and eventually leave go look for some other party.
-Who?
-Why?
So why aren't you in there right now putting moves on some waifish sophomore with low self-esteem?
-Jane Nussbaum?
-Harmon.
-Dave, I'm Aubrey.
What is that supposed to mean?
Am I not mature enough for you?
It's just you don't have that look in your eye, you know?
-Not sure I do.
So this girl Jane, she doesn't like you back?
I think she's gonna hook up with Brendan Meltzer.
My friend hooked up with Brendan once.
What are you doing to me?
I'm just saying I wouldn't get my hopes up.
Well, trust me, they're not up, okay?
Yeah, actually.
I should get back inside before, you know, they leave without me.
Do you think it's possible there's something I could say to this girl just some way I could tell her how I feel in a way that just would make her fall for me?
"Jane....
Janey lately I've been feeling like there's so much noise.
Teachers, parents, magazines.
What's in, what's out, who's cool, who's not cool enough.
And all this shit just gets so loud, I feel like I can't even hear myself think.
You know, I just wanna get in my car and drive.
But then I see you.
I see you across the hall, leaning against your locker in that jacket that you love so much and the way you tuck your hair back behind your ears.
And you see me and you smile you just smile, and it's like all that noise fades away.
And the only thing I can hear is the sound of your voice when you call out my name."
I mean, even to you.
She doesn't really care about that shit, you know, the noise and the magazines.
She doesn't wanna hear how beautiful you think she is when she tucks her hair behind her ears.
I doubt she really wants to hear anything.
All she wants to feel is a little less freaked out than she already does which, you know, is probably very.
But if you can't then you're not gonna be her dude.
-I'm never gonna be her dude, am I?
-Not with that attitude, my friend, no.
And you're a senior, so I'm pretty sure that ship has sailed.
Well, you should probably get back, huh?
If you're worried your friends are gonna leave....
You asked for my opinion.
No, I was just gonna say you could catch a ride home with me.
Yeah, those whores won't leave without me.
This song is amazing.
-Yeah, this song is amazing.
Wanna dance with me?
Look, it's just I don't dance publicly.
Okay, well, first of all, we're all alone here, you know.
Second of all, I mean, I was just talking about one dance, you know.
Well?
All we need now is for it to be raining.
Your balls are vibrating.
What should we do?
Yes.
-Where are you gonna go to college?
No, I don't know about "Smartypants McGee."
Any idea what you might wanna do?
Then probably developmental psychology.
I have no idea.
-The average amount, I think.
Yeah, do you think of yourself as a reasonably happy person?
-Content or what have you?
You've still got another year.
Are you a happy-go-lucky kind of kid?
Because I'll slap you if you are.
Well, I am right now, which is surprising.
You know I'm dating someone?
Don't apologize for who you are or are not.
-That ought to be on a T-shirt, right?
-You guys know where this party's at?
-It just got broken up by the police.
-No, dude, the one on Chestnut.
But, hey, you guys want a ride?
Well, this is me.
-Well, hey.
What were we just doing?
I don't know, I just meant--
-You asking me for my number?
Do you wanna come in for a second?
What about your boyfriend?
-I'm not gonna doink you or anything.
Do you want something to drink?
Sure.
What do you want?
I'm gonna have some wine.
Yeah, works for me.
Oh, shit.
This is really very cool.
Not really.
Then why...?
You know, most of them are my dad's.
You wanna know when I'm really happy?
Four o'clock.
And I sit here cutting out pictures.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I mean, I'm not alone much, definitely not in my house but I have my car.
Some nights, I just like to drive around, music up, windows down, just--
Have you had sex yet?
-What?
-Just asking.
-Honestly?
-No, lie to me.
Not yet.
I mean, not that there haven't been some opportunities.
-Girls lining up to have sex with you?
-No, that's not what I meant.
You wanna have sex with Jane?
I guess, yeah.
But I don't like to fantasize about....
I fantasize about holding her hand and kissing in the rain.
You know, all that cheesy, tired romantic shit that you're such a fan of.
And I fantasize about having sex with Casey Flynn.
-Is that an actress I should know?
-She's a girl who goes to my school.
She's the girl that everyone wants to have sex with because she's mean.
Jane's the girl that you want to be your girlfriend.
Have you done it yet?
None of your business.
It's all just so safe and convenient.
Homogenized.
Then with one click we too can realize our dream of boning someone exactly like us.
Get married, give birth to two and a half babies.
We can all post the pictures on Facebook or Twitter.
I wanna meet a man the old-fashioned way, you know like in a bar.
How about a dark alley?
Crazy guy who talks to himself?
Give me your hand.
Which one am I?
The virgin or the skank?
I've never met anyone like you before.
That's a pretty good answer.
I have trouble sleeping with someone in the room.
It's just, sleepovers, camp, I always hated them.
Not because I minded being away but because there was always some mouth breather next to me.
Maybe we could lie here for a minute.
And I could just close my eyes, see what it's like.
Is that okay?
Okay.
Sorry.
It's cool, Hodgman.
-What?
-You're a sweet boy, you know that?
-Shut up.
-No, you truly are.
-It's practically in the manual.
-I believed her.
If she says "boyfriend," you know she didn't like you.
But you can always tell yourself, "Hey, she has a boyfriend."
You know? "It's not me." It's a good system.
I thought you said she had a tight little bottom.
-Because.
-Because of Jane?
Seriously, David, that's never gonna happen.
She didn't give you her number, did she?
She started to.
She typed in the first few digits, and then we....
But I did get those first three digits on my phone.
How many possible combinations of numbers could there really be?
Ten thousand.
Plus, I don't even know her parents' first names.
And Lashanda says there's like 337 Millers in Deranja County.
What's a Lashanda?
The lady I talked to when I called Information.
You know where she lives.
-Find her on Facebook.
-I don't think she does Facebook.
-She doesn't believe in that sort of thing.
-She doesn't believe in it?
This girl sounds like a ginormous ass-ache, my friend.
Like a huge ache in my ass.
I'm telling you, I know the type.
The alternative rock indie chick who only goes to art films smells like vegan food, can't be bothered to shave her pits.
Eventually falls in love with a bull dyke named Harley.
-What are you jabbering about?
-What do you want?
-Whatever gets you through the night.
It's Hodgman.
-Miller, Audrey....
Okay, how about an e-mail?
Just the home number.
You want it or not, Dave?
Yes, give us the number.
We're gonna see that movie tonight, 7:15, Old Orchard.
-What movie?
-Where the world ends in five days.
-Three days.
Look, it goes without saying, leave it a few days before you call this girl.
Let's give the illusion that you have a life.
Of course.
We'll see how I feel by the end of the week or something.
Or in a couple weeks.
-Hi, yes, is this Mr. Miller?
I'm actually a friend of your....
-Only got the one that I'm aware of.
Yes, well, may I speak with her, please?
-Well, hey, it's Dave.
You know, that everything was cool with, you know....
Yeah.
Well, hey, I also wanted to say-- Well, or ask you what are you doing later?
But we're going to Old Orchard.
Well, that's where I'm going.
Later.
I think that went pretty well, right?
You stick to your area, and I will stick to mine.
But let me just say this:
We all knew at some point I was going to have a drink.
It's inevitable.
Really?
You may go.
Good.
It was a good talk.
How you doing?
Well, you know, I've been better.
I've had a really rough week, emotionally.
And I'm telling you because I might not be, like a ton of fun tonight or....
Anyway.
How are you?
Fine.
She's gonna think I'm stalking her like some weird, creepy nerd.
Poor bastard was never heard from again.
Then again, I don't plan on raping anybody.
-Jane.
B. Where did you disappear to last night?
-I was looking for you.
-I was around.
I wanted us to have one of our late-night talks.
-So, what are you doing later?
-I don't know.
-Daldry, what are we doing later?
-We're keeping our options open.
-I may have a lead for a party in La Mesa.
-We could go to my house.
The parentals are in Cabo and I told those losers I may have people over.
Her boyfriend, Ronny.
This is Brianna, Erica, Big Corporation.
Wait, sorry?
-How about you guys?
-The new AlmodГіvar film.
Is it cool if we see something else?
Whatever you want, my little tiger cub.
You wanna see a dumb movie, that's fine.
Really wonderful film, huh?
-Hey, listen--
-Give me your cell.
Okay.
And she's sitting next to you and she's holding your hand.
A female chooses her mate so her offspring have a greater chance at survival.
Although I suppose he's selling something too.
Well, I'm not sure I'm the strongest mate in my particular gene pool but I guess we can give it shot, right?
Well, hey, Ronny seems like a cool guy.
-Does he?
A bunch of us were gonna go to that girl's house after, to Brianna's.
I guess some other people too.
I wanna travel.
As a career?
Last summer I got to visit my uncle and his boyfriend in Madrid.
One day I was walking around and I got lost.
And I realized I had been so focused on where I was going and getting back that I hadn't even noticed where I was.
Eventually, I found my way back, but those few hours were the best.
What?
Let me tell you guys something.
Something you don't know, because you haven't been in the world.
But when you get to my age, you'll realize that you know, everything is just bullshit.
Nobody cares about anything except making money.
Dollar, dollar bills, y'all.
So some glorified little office boy, junior-executive prick tells the Joan Cusack Experience our stuff isn't commercial?
-What is the Joan Cusack Experience?
-I think it's the name of his band.
The simple intricacies of life.
-I'm Jane.
No, I'm with that guy.
He is gorgeous.
No, Dave is amazing.
He's one of my best friends.
Definitely my best guy friend.
He's always been there for me, through all my terrible relationships and I can tell him anything.
You should see him with his sister.
-His sister?
-Yeah, she's 5.
And he's super involved in her life because I guess the dad isn't really around or whatever.
Where is he?
Most guys our age are completely self-absorbed, you know?
-Never, right?
God, I am so sick of these arrogant jagweeds with their big stupid mouths and their tiny little penises.
Like, officially.
Because I've heard about every girl he's hooked up with, so why would I--?
But anyway, I don't know.
All I want is once for one of these boys to just, like ask me a question, you know?
Like my opinion or how I'm doing or really anything.
Because at this point, if one of them were to, like, open the door for me or offer to buy dinner I would be so frigging shocked, I would probably fall over.
You know sometimes it's just the guy that you....
Sometimes what?
No.
You.
So where did you meet my lady?
-She's pretty great.
Yeah, she is.
But this one you know, she's inspiring.
I'm actually writing a song about her.
Well, about her knees.
We're gonna have sex tonight.
Sure.
I'm not gonna lie, Dan, it's been a long time coming but we're finally doing it.
Gonna do it to it.
So where is this taking place?
Shit, I gotta move that kick drum.
Well, Ronny, that sounds unforgettable.
Pretty, pretty unforgettable.
I'm gonna go drain the Lil Wayne.
You never told me you have a sister.
I guess it never came up.
She's my half sister, technically.
Her dad's not really in our lives anymore anyway, so....
What about your dad?
He's an endodontist.
Gives one hell of a root canal, if you're ever in need.
Stupid to think I knew you after one night.
Please don't have sex with Ronny.
-Why not?
-Are you kidding me?
It's not some beautiful thing.
It happens, and it's a little gnarly and kind of uncomfortable but one day it's gonna be terrific.
It's gonna be crazy porno-sex terrific.
I just gotta get from here to there safely and on my own terms.
And I know Ronny is safe because I have my own copy of his test results.
So would you please, please just tell me why I can't go and get it over with?
You know what, Dave?
I'm on a first-name basis with my dermatologist.
Why are you smiling?
You dig me.
Oh, so, what, you're like this confident, cocky guy now?
I think that you know my name is actually Dave.
I'm gonna kick the living shit out of you.
-I'm gonna go with him.
Ronny.
Goodbye.
Not quite.
Well, I am a little tipsy.
Yes, I am.
Hey, so that girl, your friend she's super cute, right?
Yeah, super cute.
-Is she still here?
-No, they left.
Who is a hottie, by the way.
Especially the hotties.
Yeah, you've said that before.
No, this time I mean it.
Last night I did the stupidest thing ever.
I was so wasted, and we couldn't stop laughing about this thing.
Anyway, the cops showed up, and he asked me if I needed a ride home--
Do you know what "homogenized" means?
It's a kind of milk, isn't it?
Homogenized milk.
What's going on with you?
Something's weird.
What?
Jane....
Janey....
I'm gonna go.
What?
But I was just telling you about....
Don't you wanna talk?
No, not tonight.
I'll see you on Monday, okay?
Okay.
"You dig me."
I broke up with Ronny.
Well, I guess, then, we're just gonna have to drive around all night.
I could be into that.
Oh, my God.
Those kids.
I think I might be sick.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm....
It's scary stuff.
Sometimes everything seems really harsh.
I don't think I can handle it.
Or I don't know if I'm gonna be you know, strong enough to be on my own.
What?
I mean, you've got your family and you've got--
-I think you should too.
-All right, then, go.
Or, like, don't go out of your way or anything.
Okay.
I thought you had calculus homework.
I wasn't gonna bug you for at least another 15 minutes.
Yeah, maybe I could....
No, are you kidding me?
We've never been apart for that long, so it'll be an adjustment, definitely.
I mean, but I'll be back all the time, and she'll come out a lot.
Where's her father?
We just don't really know.
He had a drug problem.
Got himself into debt, took off.
It was a real mess.
The worst part Stella really liked him, and he just completely bailed on her.
That's part of why it's hard, you know, leaving.
I don't want her to worry that I'm not gonna come back.
Dave, it's....
No, you're right.
It'll be fine.
What are you two talking about over here?
-We were talking about roller coasters.
The benefit.
Are you listening when I tell you these things?
You should eat it, because we're gonna be late, okay?
-As would I. Let's go.
-Coming.
So here's the thing.
-My parents are gonna go to this benefit.
-You should come over.
-Really?
Like 45 minutes-ish?
No.
No, because you're not that guy.
You're not that guy who walks around with a condom in his wallet.
You're not.
Can I put this down in your room?
It's deceptively heavy.
Thanks.
-What you got in there?
Well, now I know that.
I should have gotten you a box of flowers.
You shouldn't have gotten me anything.
I don't know why I'm telling you about my action-figure collection, but--
You are just completely ridiculous.
I dig you so much.
So much it, like, freaks me out.
I told you.
I want you to hear this song I downloaded last night.
I was maybe gonna put it on a CD with some other stuff for your car.
So, what do you wanna do?
I'm pretty sure there's quite a few movies.
I'm pretty sure I've seen them all.
Okay, then, that's out.
Yeah, so, what's the point?
We could play a game.
You know, like Chutes and Ladders or Boggle.
I'd wipe the floor with you if we played Boggle.
Seriously, I'm amazing.
I could have gone pro if I hadn't blown out my knee.
Really.
What?
And I don't wanna do anything that might screw it up.
Yeah, we should just, you know, take things slow, not rush things.
-We don't wanna be clichГ©.
-ClichГ©s are the worst.
-We are not bunnies.
We are capable of making intelligent, rational decisions.
Fuck it.
Well, did you bring a condom?
I have one.
-What?
-A condom.
Should I get it?
That's a thing you could do.
Holy shit.
All right.
You can have it.
This is for me.
And it hasn't expired yet.
You know, still got a good 18 months on this guy.
Not that I have that kind of stamina.
"Spermicide" is an ominous-sounding word.
-Sounds like something Nazis committed.
Do you want me to, you know...?
Don't wig out.
At least the condom didn't break.
I think that it can be better.
But it wasn't your fault.
-I didn't think it was.
-And you think that that's us?
-I don't know.
But I don't think that's how it was supposed to go.
You know, even if you've never....
It didn't feel right.
I mean, maybe you weren't turned on enough or something.
But with girls, I just-- I had no idea it got so complicated.
There are plenty of venereal diseases that you can get without intercourse.
This happened really fast and we got carried away and we made a mistake.
And, you know, it's-- Look, it's not that big of a deal.
Not the end of the world.
I guess I'll just do about anything to put off my calculus homework.
Yeah, well, I should probably go.
Or I'm gonna have to jump off that roof when your parents come home.
Wait.
He said he wrote this song that he wants me to hear.
I know you wanna spend as much time with your sister as possible before you leave for New York so this probably isn't a great time for you either.
Anything.
Practically what?
Come on.
Shit.
Sex is so much better before you've had it.
Because before you've had it, it's everything.
I mean, your entire world is, like, consumed in this....
Well, you guys know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, Friday.
Seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?
I'd do it all different.
I'm gonna ask you a serious question and think about it before you give me the answer.
Is it possible that the problem was that you're actually, like huge?
And you've never realized it, because you never had anything to compare it to.
What?
And in a couple of weeks, it'll be prom, then graduation and before you know it, you're on a plane to JFK.
So it was never gonna last anyway.
And now it's done with.
And that's it.
-Well, I mean, it was a pretty major bump.
And I don't mean in no bullshit way, like you're tough or you're a dick.
All right, let me ask you this.
And now I just wanna know, before we go full commando here what is it that's so special about this particular girl?
Anyway, I guess I'm just trying to say I'm sorry.
-What?
-To have sex.
Whatever it takes.
It's late and I'm really tired.
I have to get up for school in like four hours.
We're definitely not together.
I don't think I can have this conversation right now.
Nobody gets me, I mean really gets me, the way that you do.
I love--
Slut.
Morning.
I met a boy.
Honey, I'm sure you didn't.
No, I did.
I'm never gonna see him again.
Oh, sweetheart.
I love you.
Anyways, I should go before I miss the bus.
I want you to remember every detail of what just happened because it's never going to happen again.
I don't know much about relationships.
Neither do I.
I definitely don't know anything about love.
I can't believe I talked like I did.
All I want, like, in the world, is to just keep talking to you.
I wanna know how your day was, where you wanna eat and I wanna argue with you.
And I wanna hear all your theories even the ones that are just completely, you know, wrong.
No, I really believe that if you'd just be willing to continue having this conversation with me then we can figure the rest out.
I'm gonna be late for school.
All right.
Nope, not that one either.
You know, none of my theories are wrong, by the way.
And as far as what you said before about wanting to keep talking I'm obviously totally into that.
But I would also like to work on the sex thing.
-I actually had a few ideas about that.
-You're ridiculous.
-Well, deal with it.
-Hey, what's up?
So...?
So, what?
So do you wanna pick me up after school?
If you make a crack about the fact that I'm in jazz band, you'll regret it.
Be right here.
Later.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
You--you just wanna take away something that matters to me?
Did you even care about Dan?
I have something I think you'd like to see.
What's it like being a book agent and working with my good friend Dan?
Why was Ivy Dickens here anyway?
Mrs. Rhodes is up right now if you'd like to talk to her.
You shouldn't have sent that video in to "Gossip Girl."
I didn't do it.
February is the shortest month, but the bitter chill makes it feel the longest.
The smart ones, like me, escape to more tropical climates, while some of my Upper East Side friends use the time to hunker down and finish their work.
Others snuggle up in bed with their agendas to keep them warm.
And then there are the homes that feel even colder inside than it is out.
Hello?
You did not have to buy me a gift.
It's gorgeous.
It'll look even more gorgeous on you.
Lunch today so I can see it?
Uh, I can't.
So what about after you're done?
Which is here because...
Lily hates it, and she'd throw it out if she got her hands on it.
Well, you might wanna listen to a woman with taste.
That reminds me, how's everything going with Blair?
That's a nice transition, but we haven't really spoken.
Nothing good could come of us hanging out right now.
So if we're not gonna be more than friends, it's too hard to be... just friends.
Yeah, I actually feel really good about it.
Hey, would you mind waiting, uh, for the messenger to come pick this up?
'Cause Chuck invited me over, and I'm gonna stop by on my way to the library.
He's not still mad at you for running off with Blair at the wedding?
Uh... well, I guess neither of us is letting our feelings for Blair keep us down.
Why does everybody hate this jacket?
I told you that I'm sorry.
Oh, so that's your excuse-- multiple personality disorder?
Mm, looks like we're all out.
I go get more.
Oh, why don't you just take mine?
You don't seem to have a problem doing that.
You not coming out until you work this out!
I don't care if it takes all day!
So what have you been up to since the party?
Oh, I'm supposed to be doing schoolwork, but I'm really just procrastinating.
Do you not like her or something?
Oh, actually, I'm performing it at the Upright Citizens Brigade.
It's this improv group, and they have a book night where they read excerpts from current novels.
We're taking monkey for a walk.
I thought since he's the reason I'm saddled with the mutt, he can freeze his ass, too.
Of course.
Losing Blair was tough on us both, but it's not your fault.
So you're not mad about what happened?
Because she used you as her getaway driver?
As for monkey, I'm afraid he'll have to wait.
Nathaniel's new friend would like to speak with you about "Inside."
So what's this I hear about my book?
I'm married.
And I haven't seen Dan since Valentine's Day.
By hanging out with him all day.
Why don't you come with me?
I'm not spending the day with you and Dan.
And what would that prove anyway?
That he and I are nothing more than old friends.
Yeah, of course.
Thanks.
Not really.
It's... complicated.
But I swear, I am not doing anything to hurt you.
And apparently, one of her extracurricular activities is partying at Nate Archibald's.
How could that happen?
You haven't called the family, have you?
Now let's get you back to bed.
I need a taxi to take me to the train station.
Thanks.
I'll be right back.
Is everything okay?
I think we need to get her to the hospital.
Then we need to go against her wishes and tell the rest of the family.
You know, I think it'd be best if you call them.
I get confused with all the medical terms.
All right.
What are you doing here now?
I couldn't wait.
You should send it now, because what I have in mind is going to take the whole... afternoon.
Oh, that's, um, that's not how the process works.
I did read an... earlier draft, and it was in excellent shape.
I'm sure all he's done is changed a few commas here and there.
I should, um-- lock the door?
Already done.
Hold all my calls and messenger Dan's proposal on to Jonathan Karp.
Oh, this is our director, Connor.
Just be a good sport and get ready to be mocked.
So we're starting with the deb ball and the destruction of the gown scene, right?
I charged it.
If you wanted Charlie's number, you could've just asked.
She's in--she's in a closed door meeting?
Oh, well, I saw you on the "Gossip Girl" "Spotted" map, and I-I thought I'd come by and drop these DVDs off.
Can't a friend stop by to hang out with another friend to do... whatever it is we're doing here?
We can get past that and be friends, just like old times.
It's challenging, but it really gives you a feeling of peace, especially because I miss Charlie so much.
I heard Nate had a terrific Valentine's Day party.
Did Charlie seem okay?
She mentioned that Nate might be dating someone.
Uh, yeah, I think a girl named Lola, but I don't really know what's gonna happen with that.
No, believe it or not, it's actually a good thing.
Oh, no, dear.
Clair's a dictator, and you don't even have a doorman.
Friends aren't afraid to be with each other or feel awkward together.
So in the scene where Clair kisses Dylan, is that, like, a passionate kiss or is it just a sweet one?
First off, if you had done your homework, you would know the answer.
I mean, even Gossip Girl knows that.
Who's Gossip Girl?
I thought this theater company was professional.
Have you never heard of research?
Log on and learn everything you need to know about me, stat.
But you can skip my entire freshman year of college.
Secondly, Clair would never kiss Dylan passionately ever.
If she had to kiss him at all, it would be perfunctory, like shaking someone's hand or petting a dog.
Are you intentionally being obtuse?
I mean, a Clair-Dylan kiss would mean nothing.
It should look like this.
Hey, you guys know what happened to Serena?
Look, it wasn't what it looked like.
Please, just stop.
We're not servants to our emotions.
We can control them, suppress them, stomp them out like bugs.
You know, I-I can't do this anymore.
I can't stand here and listen to you lie to me and--and lie to yourself.
Hey, mom, can I call you back, please?
You are trouble.
Oh, my God.
You made me miss four calls from Jonathan Karp.
I wonder what's going on.
Yes, it's Alessandra for Jonathan.
You read it?
You look like you have your hands full.
I'll just leave you with this.
I'm sure there must be some explanation.
I'm in the middle of something here.
But Serena's mad at me because of the kiss, and I-I keep telling her it doesn't mean anything but--
Or I can go.
I really need a friend right now.
I want you.
And if you don't feel the same way about me, then I don't think we should be seeing each other anymore.
It's just this really weird situation, and I don't want to get you wrapped up in it.
Spotted--Charlie Rhodes entering the hospital.
Here's hoping it's for a checkup and not that she's being checked in.
Okay, I'll just wait here, then.
We--we think she has a blood clot in her lung.
Her doctor's waiting for her inside.
Charlie, what are you doing here?
I, um, I just went to visit grandma and, um...
She's been such a solace to her.
You've been taking care of her?
Dr. Glassman, what is-- what's going on?
What do you think you're doing?
Look, I thought we were taking her to a hospital in the Hamptons.
Looks like the heat just got turned up on our Upper East Side's favorite impostor.
There you are.
You mean the one you plagiarized?
It's a--it's an alternative history of Manhattan as a--as a monarchy.
Yeah, I may not have technically read it.
Okay, let me check my computer and just make sure that you got the right one, and we'll make this go away.
House opens in five.
I have been looking for you everywhere.
I was just trying to stay out of the way, give you and the family some space.
Which makes sense since you're not family.
You were supposed to disappear months ago.
I don't wanna hear your sob story.
Well, I can't leave now.
I promised Cece I would stay.
Besides, what would everyone think?
Well, you better hope that they don't.
I don't understand.
Dan, is this some sort of cry for help?
That's a nice scarf.
I'm gonna go back to the office and try to convince Karp this was a mistake or a practical joke.
When did you forget who you are?
You wanted to be the most powerful woman in America.
"Not just America."
Really?
I don't know who I am without him, Sabrina.
You guys are doing a really good job here, making fun of this.
You never used to.
You're Clair Carlyle.
You're in control of your own destiny, and most of Manhattan's.
How did you get so smart?
Dylan?
We might be best friends, but Dylan and you have something that even you and I don't have.
Remember when you won that essay competition, and your mother was too busy to even show up to watch you get your award?
Who came, even though you treated him so terribly?
No matter how you treat him, he cares about you, not in spite of who you are, but because of it.
Yes, Dylan does.
Oh, my gosh.
I-I've gotta go right now.
Apparently, her cancer, which we didn't know had returned, was responding well to chemo, but then this--is just such a nightmare.
Mom?
She's, uh... my daughter.
That's the Upper East Side turning their backs on you and tossing you out into the cold.
Ivy, don't say a word.
Your mom hired me to be you.
Why would you do that?
To protect you.
I was supposed to gain access to your trust fund for your mother, which I did, and then I went back to my own life, then I ran into you in L.A...
So you did all of this for money?
You hid an entire family from me for money?
You don't know these people, what they're capable of.
Lily, Rufus, and Serena, I understand that you're mad.
Look, I'm sorry.
Charlie... don't.
Why would you do this to me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I thought that was a nice touch.
I'm impressed you know the value of quality.
You've learned so much from me in such a short period of time.
Whether it's true or not, you will be tainted, and your publisher will drop you for good.
You see, you can't win against me, Humphrey.
So this is about Blair.
And up until this moment, I wasn't sure if I did.
So thank you.
I never really had a family.
You were so good to me, like a big sister I never had.
I really care about you guys.
I'm not leaving.
You're nothing to her-- a stranger, a nobody, so get outta here before I call the cops.
I go by "Lola" now.
My whole life, you told me it was just us.
What is so terrible about those people that you didn't want me to know them?
Or is it that you didn't think I deserved to know them?
Everything I have done is to protect you, to--to protect us.
After today, there is no us.
Bye, mother.
And that one has to hurt.
Thank you for telling me about Cece.
I'm a little afraid to go in.
One of my specialties-- warped logic.
Well, whatever this is, it will have to wait.
So it seems you were right.
I do have feelings for Dan.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be.
But I won't see him.
Not because I'm in denial, but because I care too much about your friendship.
You come first.
And if our friendship is real, which I know it is, then we can get through this.
You two are gonna face a lot of obstacles, but I'm not gonna be one of 'em.
I don't wanna get in the way of you and Dan.
I'm really glad you're here, though.
I guess so.
What do you mean that cater girl is your cousin?
Oh, there's a lot going on here.
You ready to face the mayhem?
I need to make a phone call first.
Chuck, stop trying to hurt Dan.
If you wanna be mad at anybody, be mad at me.
Dan has done nothing to you but be a friend.
You made it seem like you wanted me to wait for you.
I-I need some time to figure some things out, and... if you target him, then it'll just push us closer together, and I know you're too smart for that.
You're better than that, so please.
Blair, don't...
And the signs are clear-- a ray of sunlight that cuts through the darkness.
Yeah.
Oh, well, let me get you home.
I'm gonna head home.
I'm gonna stay.
Serena needs me.
Turns out tropical islands are boring, and the lack of scandal is getting to me.
So I've decided to turn up the heat from afar.
I have a certain e-mail from Lonely Boy that will make Chuck Bass' blood boil.
Humphrey, you bastard.
But if you think winter's over, think again.
There's sure to be another cold snap... and sadly, some won't survive the winter.
I don't have good news.
Cece had a stroke as we were prepping her for surgery.
There's nothing we can do.
You need to go in and say your good-byes.
So come out of the cold, my Upper East Siders... and into the cozy warmth of my home.
My doors are always open.
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.
One, two three, four, five, six, seven eight, nine, 10.
That was better.
- Don't say anything yet.
Oh, my God, you are so sexy when you make secret plans.
Thanks, sweetie.
Seriously, no bus.
And you wonder why I love you so much.
Hey, you wanna go see that instead?
Dad said no way.
- Come on, let's do it.
You're gonna have to hold my hand during the really scary parts.
I'll hold it the whole time.
- The big park.
Love you.
- Dude, what happened?
- I went through a door.
I can't believe you missed that part.
Um, excuse me, that was our exit.
Well, I would, but now I'm not getting any service.
I think if you just keep going straight, then- okay.
Hey, listen, um...
Mom, is everything okay?
This is scaring us.
Damn it!
Let us out of the fucking car!
Motherfucker!
- He's getting out.
- What is happening?
- No, I'm not leaving without you.
It's gonna be okay.
Mom, are you okay?
Oh, my God.
- We're gonna be okay, all right?
Leave her alone!
You look like your mother.
My dad's gonna find you.
If- if that's what you believe.
That is the last free shot that you will ever get.
You will skip dinner.
I want my mom.
Well, she's not coming back, ever, so get used to it.
You smell like piss.
You will have one job.
You do what I say.
You clean up my house.
Garbage bags, mops, bucket, broom- they are your tools.
Breakfast.
You will serve me breakfast every morning for the rest of your life.
You will not eat or drink anything without my permission.
You only eat after I have eaten, and only what I have left on my plate.
You hear that?
That means that I'm bringing one back.
You have 10 seconds to open these locks.
Every night I bring home a newspaper.
After I finish reading it, I want you to try and find stories about missing people.
There is no phone in this house.
The TV is off limits unless I offer it.
If someone knocks at the- well, no one's gonna knock.
If you steal from me, you get a beating.
If you try and escape or you don't keep the house clean, you get a beating.
If you make me nervous or get in my way at all, a beating.
From now on, this is your world.
It is only you, me, and them.
I will call you Rabbit.
On page 12, there is a nice piece about you and your mother missing.
Put it in the scrapbook.
You going somewhere, Rabbit?
You get an A for effort.
I know every move that you make.
Help!
Everything you do I let you do!
Go ahead, let it out.
Help!
- That's it.
- Come on.
You are so fucking predictable.
Help!
Come on.
Come on, Rabbit.
Hey, Rabbit, what are you gonna do with that?
Don't be a quitter.
Rabbit, you have to follow through.
Following through is the key to life.
Come on, kid!
Come on, give it all you've got.
You're a paper doll.
Thanks.
2314 Grafton.
I'm... real sorry, Dad.
I've known you all your life... and you're nothing special.
You're nothing special.
Did your dad toss a ball around with you in the backyard?
You know, after school, like- or Sundays?
Because it's important as hell to know shit.
Otherwise, people will- they will walk all over you.
You are not going to be ignorant.
You're going to study and you're going to learn.
- About what?
- People- what makes them tick, what makes them work, what's in the gut and the head.
Why?
Because without education, you're fucked.
You ever do a puzzle?
You know, the kind of puzzle that has the picture on the outside of the box?
That's what people are- pictures on the outside, pieces inside.
This book is about the human puzzle.
You study this, you learn it, and you know how to take people apart, put them back together, understand them.
So study it and- just study.
You don't want to be shackled to this house for the rest of your life, do you?
There's hope for you yet.
So, study hard, and then maybe you and I can work out a deal.
A deal for what?
Some freedom.
You know, get off the chain, get out of the house, get a girl.
You're older now.
I think that... you should have a taste of a woman real soon.
I give you a gift of knowledge and you fuck it away!
You are looking to be shackled to this fucking wall for the rest of your life, mister.
I wasn't gonna show you this, but now that you're being a shit...
That's your dad.
Dad.
He's got a new wife, a new life.
You see this, kid?
That is not someone that misses you.
You got me and no one else.
Here, have a beer.
No, thank you.
That's good.
- Give me an answer.
- I - I'm not sure.
That's not the answer I'm looking for, not by a long shot.
But I'm not sure.
If we gotta stay here all night, then that's what we'll do- we'll stay here all night.
That's good.
How do I get out of here?
Which way?
Which way is out?
I'll take you with me.
I don't want your fucking blanket!
Please!
I just wanna go home.
How the fuck do I get out of-
Go.
That's what you want in a girl- some fight.
There's no sport in easy.
- You thinking stupid thoughts?
Good.
Listening is good.
Come on.
She was quite a ride, too.
She sure could run.
Hey, let's play.
Come on.
Ellen Rand.
22 years old.
February the 19th.
Lied like a rug about her weight big time.
Thank you.
Jennifer Elizabeth Wyatt.
1642 Melvin Road, apartment 7.
And you said that she was honest about her weight.
She put 126.
I don't know about weight.
Well, you will.
You'd better go in.
Well, there they are now.
Your mother's been worried sick about you boys.
Lying sack of shit!
You think you're better than I am just because I got laid off?
Aren't you, Bobby?
Big man making money.
Get your fuckin' clothes off, Bobby, now!
You're a fucking whore, Joanne.
Get off me.
I need to pee.
Which way?
I gotta go.
Please?
I gotta go.
Show her where the powder room is, Rabbit.
Show me.
Not that powder room.
The other one.
You're gonna tie me up?
You guys.
That's not cool.
You'd rather I didn't?
That's what I'm gonna do.
Remember I saw you dancing?
- Yeah.
- Remember?
I love dancing.
But you didn't dance.
I think I'm too drunk.
I'm drunk.
Don't be silly.
Everything will be okay, right?
- It's okay.
- Now come here.
- Carotid artery.
- Yes, carotid artery.
Mary.
I got something for you.
This is a school yearbook.
You see?
It has...
Tell me when you see something you like.
Pick it up.
I don't want it.
Pick it up.
Where do you think that you are right now on the food chain, Rabbit?
I won't do it.
No kid of mine is gonna grow up uselessly educated.
I'm not your kid.
The fuck you're not.
Pick it up.
Look around.
What do you see?
Do you see anything that says that you aren't my kid?
That we aren't family?
Do you see?
Now pick it up.
Good.
I don't wanna hear a sound out of you the rest of the night.
I don't wanna know that you exist.
Thank you.
We made the news again.
They don't know anything, the cops.
We are a mystery.
It is a good day to be me, Rabbit.
I'm done with this scrapbook.
It's full.
Well, I will get you another one.
It's good to keep a record.
Why do you do what you do?
What the fuck?
I asked why you do what you do.
- Why do you do what you do?
- You make me.
Well, that is a good answer.
Them... under the dirt, in the book.
They never asked to be murdered.
Oh, you are growing a pair all of a sudden.
And they did.
- They asked.
- When?
The day that they were fuckin' born.
I don't understand.
You are f- are you trying to make me fucking insane?
Do I have to spell it out for you?
They are all fucking whores!
They are all fucking sluts!
They seemed like nice people to me.
"They seemed like nice people to me. "
Oh, you are- oh, you gotta get laid.
You are getting fucked up in the head.
Gotta get your taste of a woman for sure.
Nothing like the taste of a woman to make you clear.
Did you find one yet?
We'll see.
Somewhere...
Somewhere in here there is a Mrs. Right.
Somewhere in here.
Pick one.
Don't be shy.
I think that's a good choice.
Oh, yes.
She's ready.
Come on.
Rabbit.
You're scared.
That's okay.
You said to me that you didn't want to be chained to the wall your whole life, didn't you?
Come on.
Let's go.
There's only one real way out for you to prove to me that I can trust you.
And there's only- there's only one way to do that.
Let's go.
Be quiet.
Quiet to keep the mood.
Quiet.
It's his first time... so he's a little shy.
You remember what we talked about?
If you can't do it, I will.
And you know how that will turn out.
So you keep your head straight.
Have some fun.
I'm Angie.
I'm 18.
What's your name?
I'm Rabbit.
Are you gonna hurt me, Rabbit?
I don't want to.
But he's expecting you to.
But you have a knife.
Can't we- can't we just get out of here?
We can't get out.
How long have you been here?
Since I was nine.
I'm sorry, Rabbit.
He hurts you, doesn't he?
When he feels like he should, yes.
If you- if you wanna have sex, I'll have sex with you.
I'll do any- anything you want.
I don't want anything.
This isn't about sex.
Then- then what is it about?
I guess it is about sex if sex involves killing.
Oh, shit.
But I haven't done either.
Have you ever touched a girl?
You can touch me, Rabbit.
You can touch me however you want.
I already know how your body works.
You can have me.
We will do whatever you want.
Am I hurting you?
Are you okay?
Rabbit.
Go away!
I want to hunt.
God damn.
Look who's all grown up.
What do you think?
- Mine?
- Graduation present.
- It's good.
We are in a cab and we're on our way home.
Love you.
Um, so you have to tuck down until we get into town.
I feel energized.
At night is the best time to hunt.
My vision is clear.
I'm good being here with you now.
This is good.
You're a good kid.
The first thing that you have to be clear about is your type.
If you're into prostitution, maybe get a few of them under your belt, and then move onto something else.
If you come across one like that- look at her, all buttoned up like she's never sucked on a cock before.
Where next?
- Like Angie?
- Yes, like Angie.
Maybe this is too much too soon.
We'll go back home.
We could watch the movie of your first time.
You made a movie of me and Angie?
I told you, I will watch it, and you will watch it with me.
It's important.
You can't do it wrong, Rabbit.
I'll drive by the college campus, then we'll go home.
Get down.
What did you do?
Shut up!
Have some fun.
- Am I hurting you?
- If you can't do it, I will.
Go away!
You stabbed me.
I know.
I had to or he would have.
I tried to miss the vital organs.
I think I did okay.
I know how your body works.
You'll be okay for about two days, and then you're gonna get really sick.
Two days?
Dead girls don't make any noise.
I've seen a lot of dead girls.
You need to fix this, Rabbit.
I'm really disappointed.
You need to make it right.
And don't further insult me by pretending like you don't hear me!
You fuck her?
Probably not.
I mean, you could have at least fucked her.
I gotta do it now anyway.
I don't like that you fuckin' lied to me!
How are you doing, young lady?
- How're you doing, Ange?
Angie!
Don't hurt her!
Ah, fuck!
Come here, you fucking whore!
- Get off of me!
Fuck.
I knew that you were thinking it.
Shut up.
Rabbit, you can't do this.
Rabbit.
Marie, the dog should be out back.
What you selling?
I always wanted a puppy.
Yeah, well, I'm about ready to give you ours.
- Come on, Marie.
- You said we couldn't afford it.
I said what?
- Tim?
- I'm so sorry.
- Tim, is that you?
Your son Tim?
My, God, Tim, you're alive.
How- how did you find me?
Where have you been?
Where have you been, Tim?
He- he killed Mom.
I'm so sorry.
You're safe now, honey.
I just wanna know why, Dad.
- You gave this to your brother.
You told me to look after Mom.
I was just a kid and I couldn't save her, and you knew I couldn't save her.
I have a brother.
Hey, Marie, take Colin upstairs.
Tim and I need to have a little talk.
In one ear and out the window.
Get up the stairs, Marie.
I found your letter.
I know where you came from and I know everything.
Robert Fittler, your older brother- you paid him to make us go away.
And I'm gonna tell.
You're gonna tell on me?
Go on, get out of here.
I don't even wanna look at you.
Stop!
Quiet.
Be quiet.
Don't hurt her!
Go.
Go!
Mom, what's happening?
Stay in your room, Colin.
Giovanni Sforza.
And my cousin, Catherina Sforza.
You would have a taste of vengeance.
Giovanni Sforza- he proved ungallant?
He betrayed our father, the pope.
If he misused you, he shall pay a different kind of price.
You think the blood of the Borgia pope could cure us?
We could bathe in it together, Majesty.
Catherina Sforza rides with the French.
Priorities can change, Cardinal Borgia.
The French have laid waste to the papal states.
Our proposal is that the armies combine... to rid us of this French plague.
You think we can defeat the French?
Do you have anything to confess about this past night?
My night was as satisfactory as I'm sure was yours.
I would beg your permission to investigate the office of public works even further.
Found more irregularities?
Father Savonarola calls it usury.
This pope is a lecherous abomination!
Florence, you will pay for your greed... when he drags you to perdition!
Savonarola prophesied the end of days... not the murder of the pope.
If I had his approval, would I have yours?
Like an enormous bank machine.
The faithful pay to maintain it in its magnificent splendor.
This theatre of redemption.
The greater the display, the more they gather from all corners of Christendom.
Can the College of Cardinals be made to see the light?
The French munitions were destroyed by some brave Roman souls.
Were you one of them?
I dress in red satin, Father, not in armour.
Dare we say it, like us.
So, now we got rid of one enemy, it's now time to deal with another.
Friar Savonarola?
Your cousin, Catherina Sforza!
Oh, so it continues.
She has retired to her castle in Forli with an abundance of French cannon.
Well, then I can defend her no longer, Your Holiness.
We would have her come to Rome and kneel at our feet and have those beauteous lips kiss the papal ring.
You care so little for your hide?
To Florence... and its heretic, Savonarola!
Do you know anyone in Forli?
I was born there.
But you must show us your ancestral home.
And who pays, who pays for such decadence?
Where does your charity end up?
In the Medici bank, in Florence where it multiplies like maggots through usury.
If we are discovered, they will tear you limb from limb.
Did Adam need gold coin?
Did Eve need diamond and pearl?
We must drive the Medici bank from Florence or burn it to the ground.
Pray with me.
She can go on like this for hours, Your Eminence.
Eminence?
Is he eminent?
In my own small world.
He is your dottore, is he not?
His dottore?
You have a name, dottore?
Cesare.
And you have read many books?
Books?
What kind of dottore are you?
To cut up the cadaver?
The best.
And he has but one ambition.
Ambition?
To look after his mama when she's old.
He told you that?
What does he say?
Ah, my boy.
My sweet, dear blessed boy.
Look at those hands, dottore.
The hands of a healer, no?
A maestro.
My dottore maestro.
Augustino's getting married.
You won't stay the night?
I have business in Forli.
Dottore business.
Yes, as have you.
Mama...
So, dottore, shall we heal the sick?
No, I killed him.
Friar.
Are you the cleric in red?
I find the robes of your order suit me better at this pitiful juncture.
Have you taken our vows?
I can no longer serve the Pope of Rome.
Ah, yes, I heard of your plans for his deposition.
Your plans failed miserably.
I am here to propose a solution to the sickness in our Holy Mother Church.
A solution?
We must remove him.
From the chair of St. Peter's?
From the chair of St. Peter's.
But you tried that already.
From the chair of St. Peter's and from this world.
No one dared approach it.
Are you saying you're the one to bring this to pass?
Be the sword of the apocalypse, the sword of righteousness.
Ride out like death, on a pale horse.
Your Holiness.
Signore Machiavelli.
Had we been graced with news of your arrival, we could have done justice to your presence.
We cannot always travel in public splendor.
A pope must learn the problems of his subjects.
Too many of them.
Would we be safer in your mother's humble abode, Micheletto?
You will always be safe, whenever I am near, Eminence.
This Sforza family are not to be trusted.
Stay close and keep the horses saddled.
You bear arms yourself, Signore Borgia?
No, my love, he wears a cardinal's skirt.
He comes bearing a message from his father, the Pope of Rome.
Have I guessed correctly, Cardinal?
You think so little of your charms?
You've come to sample them, perhaps?
Perhaps.
While bearing a message from the Pope of Rome.
He would sample my charms also?
Perhaps.
He would feel your lips on his papal ring.
The whole world must bow to the Holy Father.
Whom does your mother bow to, my son?
Nobody.
You heard him, Cardinal?
His mother bows to nobody.
And if nobody were to sit at her table?
She would not bow.
But there are other forms of obeisance.
Are there, Mother?
Indeed, my son.
There is a form of surrender which implies no submission.
It gave birth to you.
I confess I am lost, Mother.
Indeed, you are truly a soldier made of hard wood.
You are our guest this fine evening.
I'd have no discord between us.
You can relay the Holy Father's message in its fullness tomorrow.
We live in a fortress now, barricaded against a sea of zealots in the streets outside.
They would reduce all exchange to the state of barter only possible in the garden of Eden.
And what of banking?
Did Adam need gold coin?
Did Eve need a bank?
Did Cain charge interest to Abel?
And what of the Church's deposits in your banks?
They would scatter them like chaff.
And if they knew, Holy Father, of your personal accounts, they would burn the bank to the ground.
Well, then, perhaps we had better have our wealth brought back to Rome.
Perhaps the good friar could be bought.
With money?
No, bishopric.
The generalship of the Dominican order.
The Dominican order already does his bidding.
And how can you buy one who would outlaw trade itself?
You offer him something that money cannot buy.
Heaven itself.
Is it good?
He has the voice of an angel.
Not a soldier, then?
Must we always meet among old bones?
You know why.
And us.
You remember.
I've tried to forget.
And you?
Did you not forget?
I forget nothing.
My father, Galeazzo Sforza.
The Sforzas of Forli never surrender.
And never kneel.
Giorgio will now show you to your rooms.
I was led here.
Your manservant.
By mistake.
May I leave?
I am still your guest here.
In my room?
An intruder, surely.
Help.
Is that blade truly necessary?
I am a freak of nature, Cardinal.
I should deal with you harshly then.
You should put me down.
Your marriage will be a lie.
Like your studies.
I'm a wheelwright, Micheletto.
Then come to Rome.
I know what your life is in Rome.
My life, what is my life, Augustino?
It does not involve healing.
I punish this world for not being as I want.
Those cannon were fake.
What cannon?
I was wondering how you had whipped up numberless pieces.
Which is the trouble with you Borgias.
We are commoners, my lady.
But of a rare Spanish breed.
So, how do we entice this friar to Rome?
As you said, with the offer of a bishopric.
A bishopric may not be carrot enough.
Maybe a cardinal's hat?
Dear God, is she a heretic too?
She is a woman who bears a man's arms.
We would befriend your cousin, Cardinal.
We would hold her close... and dear.
Make way there!
Make way for His Holiness!
Stand aside!
Make way for His Holiness, the Pope of Rome!
A cardinal's stocking, Giulia.
You are indeed observant.
And what do I spy between those mounds of sleeping flesh?
Fuck off.
Oh, can I help you-ladies?
We're in search of cardinals.
Well, you've come to the right place then.
We should have called this place the Sistine Chapel.
As do we, madam.
And you are?
The committee for the betterment of the lives of the ladies of the Roman night.
Oh, goodness.
Well, you must come and meet our madam, then.
Oh Madam, there are some ladies here to see you!
Good God, no.
A lady has a future.
And your girls have none?
I was a courtesan, my dear, never a streetwalker.
My girls might walk the streets, but they ply their trade here.
In the vilest conditions.
And you would better their lot?
And yours... if you play your cards right.
Cardinals.
I am bound to discretion with regard to my clientele, my ladies.
We have a proposition for you, madam.
That we pay for the refurbishment of your premises.
We restore it to cleanliness, comfort, a condition of absolute health.
In return for?
The details of any cardinal who crosses the bounds of propriety.
Brother Guiliano, you bring news from Florence?
Friar Savanarola commanded us to be the sword of the apocalypse.
Death himself, on his pale horse.
But how?
He is surrounded at all times by a ring of steel.
There may yet be a way.
As the friar has said, the pope is surrounded by a ring of steel.
But if we can penetrate that ring, discover his weakness...
Cantarella.
There was a reason.
Something to do with Rome.
His Holiness the Pope- What a pity.
Pity?
To ruin this sweet dalliance with issues of politics.
When we were getting on so well.
Indeed.
That would be such a pity.
A pity indeed.
But proceed, Cardinal, if you must.
He would have you travel to Rome willingly or in chains.
And now... let me show you to your rooms.
I think I know it already.
What do you care if I come to Rome?
The pope has made an edict...
Someday, perhaps.
Your brother?
I have heard of his bluster.
Fake, again, like your cannon.
Let us dispense then with these niceties, and let me leave.
Oh, but that, Cardinal, I am not yet prepared for.
And you did admit, Cardinal the game is mine.
As a poison, cantarella is undetectable.
If given a sufficient dosage, it will definitely be fatal.
But the pope has tasters for his food, his wine.
He does indeed.
Is there one among us who is willing to die?
Serve it to the Pope of Rome and share his fate?
You should throw away those cardinal robes, you know.
I thought I had.
Too cruel.
Now, I have killed many, with an embrace such as this.
Did you love them too?
Now, you go and you be married.
You came.
When called.
Walk with me.
We have a choice, it seems.
You seek one who would give his life to restore the church to its glory.
Yes.
And you don't offer yourself?
This is too well known.
Nobody can know of him.
Nobody knows of me.
You realize the implications of your words?
Yes.
I would gladly die to rid the world of the Borgia pope.
By poison.
Cantarella.
It will be a grisly death.
But Heaven will await my soul.
I would welcome it.
Cardinal.
Your lady is...
Lady Sforza is awake.
My Lord Sforza.
I arrived in the early hours.
You must have.
You have business with your cousin?
On matters of state, always.
So she requested your presence here?
You brought your father's proposal with you.
My father, the pope?
I can only think of him as your father.
And the father of that... slattern I was tricked into marrying.
I hold my sister's interests dear.
You humiliated me before the whole of Rome.
You shall have your answer, Cesare Borgia.
It is why I am still here, my lady.
My answer is simple.
It is no.
Let me be clear.
You refuse to come to Rome?
My cousin refuses to debase herself before that swine that wears the papal tiara.
Yes and you will have mine.
I promised my sister your heart... on a dinner plate!
I can find no heart!
Guards, stop him!
Here!
So, if anybody's willing...
It is the judgment of God, Holy Father.
And God will judge your actions now!
So, please, if anyone is willing...
Wait!
Was it a sign from God, Cardinal?
No, Your Holiness.
It signalled His displeasure.
We must atone for our sins with fasting and prayer.
For how long?
Until He... smiles on us again.
We'll get you in a cell, but first the boss wants to cast an eyeball on you.
The warden likes to welcome the new fish in person.
But he's king screw, and you'd do well not to piss him off.
Outside?
Brisk air'll do wonders for a Johnson.
Me, I can barely hit these cans at 20.
Word from McNeil island has you taking pot shots at a guard with a homemade single-shot.
I wanted transfer, not murder.
Ten years on the rock, you'd be the first who'd come willingly.
Mile and a half, from here to the shore.
Drop your shoulder.
There are 47 slats in the picket fence.
You have to run a register, do inventory and stock.
Oh, it's cool, all right.
It's super-cool.
Sucks for you.
There's like six paragraphs for the other inmates, and only one paragraph for Tommy.
It's all I could find.
Did he really kill your partner?
I wonder, who's next?
Hey, Hopper.
So what's going on?
The victims, are they, you know, still here?
Look, homicides are never easy.
Who've we got?
How's the new partner working out?
Or aren't sharing it.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
You know what kind of rifle Cobb used, back in the day?
So the buildings they're searching are too far away.
Nice work.
But that hill looks about right.
Guy on the midway...
Casings should have popped this way.
What?
We've got two days to catch him.
All the prisoners were transferred off the island.
Only that's not what happened.
Not at all.
Inmates on the tier!
She's staying with her sister and her sister's husband, who I bet a Lincoln is trying to poke her in the laundry room.
Anyways, they're asking for rent, which request the missus passes to me.
Where does he go?
Solitary.
That's the last he sees of any of us.
Do you know him?
No.
He's back.
Are you working together?
Where have you been, Jack, for the past 50 years?
Who's watching me?
You disappeared from Alcatraz in 1963... how did you get here?
When you were captured, they found this in your pocket.
Do you know what it opens?
Did someone ask you to get it?
I...don't...know.
I found Cobb's storage box.
This isn't the only door without a handle, you know?
There's another one in the file room.
And there are three buttons in the elevator that you can't press without a key.
He's got a whole operation, and we're only a tiny part of it.
Cobb spent more time in solitary confinement than any other inmate on record.
Any issues with authority or had trouble following the rules?
How'd they catch him the last time?
Someone recognized him from the FBI's most wanted list.
But not before he shot his way through eight cities, from Denver to Anchorage.
How could you possibly get a ballistics report in two hours?
Does this lead to something concrete?
Then why are you still here?
You know, Emerson, they're not so bad.
Tell me Hauser isn't the nutcase I think he is.
He's a little prickly sometimes, but he's all right.
'Cause this guy's a suspect in this morning's shooting, so whoever sold him the gun is gonna be in a world of hurt.
Glad it's not you.
You know what?
This individual did, in fact, come to the store a couple of days ago.
Picked up an old Winchester.
Model 70.
You know that without looking?
Ooh, pause it there.
That a room key?
Yeah, not that many hotels still use that kind of room marker any more.
Have to figure out which one.
Give us some space.
First prison where I eat the same as you.
Full bellies make a man less likely to cause upset.
You eat alone.
"Also, I would prefer to be in a cell block where talking and fraternization was prohibited."
Really beautiful letter, son.
- No?
A new cell, a quiet cell...
I'm gonna pick up this bone now and chew on it.
I'd prefer to do that in private.
Great, may I?
Can I ask you something?
'Cause I have some theories involving wormholes, but how is it you seem to just accept everything that's happening, like it's not the biggest thing ever?
How I feel about what's happening doesn't change the fact that it is happening.
Police!
Clear!
Lucy, get down!
St. Mary's.
What happened?
She was at the window.
He must have been sitting on the room, watching, waiting for us.
Whose fault is that?
What does that matter?
Look, if I knew how they got here or what they want, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
Stop...talking!
This is what I know, that Cobb is still out there, and as long as he is, he will continue to kill, and that is all you need to know.
She's alive.
Hello, Jack.
Was she a target?
I don't know.
Was she a target?
That's a shame.
Maybe Dr. Beauregard can jog your memory.
The only thing we can do to help Lucy now is to find Cobb, Okay?
What's that?
Those are the cities where Cobb shot people.
Lucy must have set up a database on the '63s.
Those are the first five victims.
What if he used the randomness to hide his real victim?
And who was that?
Who's the 16-year-old in his life?
I don't know.
And she would have been in her 40s, not 16.
What do they mean to you, Cobb?
What are you doing?
Cobb's been ahead of us the whole time, and I'm trying to get ahead of him.
This was his cell.
Found a box in the file room filled with letters that were never delivered.
This one's for Cobb.
Why didn't he get it?
From Eloise Monroe.
Sincerely, Eloise."
What do you mean?
And this one she actually took the trouble to raise.
Is Eloise still alive?
I'll keep digging.
On your feet.
It's time for count.
Open 114.
Get up.
Welcome to solitary.
Your days of elbow-rubbing and hobnobbing are over.
Good morning.
I gotta hand it to you.
You could have done anything, jumped a guard, fire-bombed your cell, heck, you could have took a page from your own playbook and made yourself a gun.
But you showed real smarts.
Studied that rule book till you found the perfect infraction.
You win, son, fair and square.
I believe you two fellas know each other.
Well, that man makes me nervous.
Shut it!
This shocking footage was captured just a few hours ago at a local Columbus super store, where an unidentified shooter opened fire on the store's...
Lucy wasn't part of his pattern, it's number two.
The view narrows our search to three miles covering North beach and Telegraph Hill.
Both of the shootings happened at the highest vantage point in that area.
Can you remove the structures that weren't there in '63, the ones Cobb wouldn't have seen from his cell?
Uh, let me see.
How's Lucy?
Yeah, from the rooftops he could shoot down at pier 31 or Fort Mason.
That's where we're gonna find him.
Let's take a ride.
- Cobb!
No more shooting.
I don't think I can hack this.
It comes with the job.
Thanks.
Close it up.
I could have killed you today.
But now you're here, you're gonna wish I had.
I hate to see it's come to this, trussed up like a Christmas hog, but your penchant for insubordination seems insatiable.
Time and again, you've found your way back into solitary, and damned if I can figure out why.
If anyone can figure what's gone amiss in that noggin of yours, it's this little lady here.
Keys, quickly.
Release them!
Our ranks swell.
We will need more weapons.
Gratitude for your kindness, know that I have treasured it.
Is it true?
I would have you end the life of Gaius Claudius Glaber.
Glaber's own wife, this very night leaves for Rome.
Your men are now mine.
Where do you take me?
Please, I am with child --
Someone approaches.
Come.
An ancient horse, gone to grass.
The woods offer shorter distance for my wife to Pompeii.
Shorter by a lifetime, if tread absent caution.
Ah, it appears it already has.
How did you come by that?
Our horse, when it fell.
On the road to Pompeii, yes.
You have business there?
Meat and bone, carved for coin.
A butcher?
I am the Praetor's --
Apologies.
Help me!
Raise voice again, and I will hack tongue from fucking mouth.
Ask any price.
My husband will see it paid for my return.
I seek no ransom.
You are going to rob me of my life?
I could have speared him.
He was beyond your throw.
And kind and just.
I have peered into your very heart, and know what it holds.
You would not have found content so pleasing, if you had chanced upon me in my youth.
I stood more animal than man.
And what tamed the wild beast?
Your wife, of course.
Take the life of Glaber's woman, as he took the life of yours.
See end to vengeance, and with it the suffering of all caught between you and such desires.
I am to blame for her fate.
Had I not broken words with Gannicus he never would have known Ilithyia was the road.
An unfortunate slip of the tongue.
The man is probably in league with the fucking Thracian.
They were both slaves under your house, were they not?
Separated by a distance of years.
Not that it is a thing of matter now.
Gannicus now holds my wife and unborn child.
If she yet draws breath.
He would not have risked all to take her from the city only to have her life.
She yet lives.
I feel her heart beating as though it were my own.
Your men must scour the countryside until she is found.
Such an area takes months to cover with numbers at hand.
Then send message to Rome for aid.
Word of this shall not spread beyond these walls.
I will not have the Senate whisper of how I could not protect my own wife.
A wise choice.
You talk of politics?
Ilithyia is valued friend and wife.
Do not lecture on what is at fucking risk.
Praetor.
You have seen it done?
Good.
Gather your men.
Seppia, I would have a moment.
I would not raise voice in such manner with him again, if you wish to keep purchase in this world.
Absent Ilithyia's blessings, it is a place that I shall quickly tumble from.
I would never let you fall so far, my love.
Not while I yet treasure your company.
Good...
Now keep eye on angle of my shoulders...
It will give clue to my next --
You learn quickly.
Again.
Du k'mpft ja wie ein verdammter S'ugling!
Dass du dich selbst in den Arsch fickst.
Are we to use wooden stick in battle as well?
Close mouth and heed Oenomaus.
First position!
Attack!
Nemetes does hold argument.
Towards lack of proper weapons at least.
Fuck the gods.
Is this our cause now?
Falling upon a helpless woman heavy with child?
Glaber held no pity towards my wife.
A woman far more deserving than the thing that stands before you.
Fucking bitch!
Coin before cunt, you worthless shit.
Now crawl from sight.
Get up you old cunt!
Linger yet a while, my good man.
We'll have the pleasure of your company.
What do you seek of me now, Syrian?
Gannicus.
A gladiator of some renown in Capua.
Yes, Praetor.
I would have words with the man.
He is not here.
Yet there must be some among you who have cause to share drink... and other distractions with him.
I would know of what he spoke, towards revelation of where he secrets himself.
And I would hope for another fucking drink and a whore upon my cock --
Let me ask it of you again.
Who among you has spoken with Gannicus?
Disappointing.
I did see Gannicus break words!
Who was privy to them?
My slave, Marcia.
Where is she?
Your fucking Syrian nailed her to a cross.
And I have yet to receive fair compensation for loss incurred --
Gannicus has taken something from me.
And I will see it returned.
Put all to question.
Please do not do this...
I did not know of her.
Your husband cannot claim such.
He is the one that condemned her to slavery.
You can not do this!
My child --
As I now deny Glaber of his.
The child is yours.
You lie.
Monthly blood ceased after you came to me in Batiatus' villa...
Lucretia had promised Crixus.
A cruel jest.
It is a memory that lingers, is it not?
Yes.
As does memory of my hands upon your throat.
Then see to completion what they began.
Take my life, and that of your child.
And may your wife turn from you for what you have done, when she greets you in the afterlife.
'r den Augenblick.
Oenomaus does not seem lifted by your return.
I did not think to be embraced as brother.
I have seen the bond between you.
Capturing the praetor's bitch is a fine start.
An impressive act, sure to further ignite our cause.
I seek only to end it.
It is done, then?
She yet lives.
And what of the women crucified in the streets of Capua?
Tortured to death because they dare whisper your name, eyes bright with thoughts of freedom and rebellion?
Prayer alone will not provide guidance through these dark times.
We must look inward, and find strength in heart's resolve.
So the gods turn from you, as they do from Ilithyia?
They are always with us.
They guide our hands, compelling us toward proper course.
Gaius will be pleased to hear of it.
It is not Gaius who holds the key to Ilithyia's salvation.
I fear the gods have led you far astray then.
I command no army, nor can I conjure Gannicus before us.
Yet message from you would bring Varinius from Rome, and with him --
Words borne of desperation.
Seppia.
Send message, and you could yet gain them.
The whims of a child.
Such thoughts have been set aside in favor of mature pursuits.
The day has been long.
I will see you beneath the covers.
We will revisit the subject with the morning sun.
Apologies, I'm not yet for bed.
I would check upon Gaius, and offer words of comfort.
Are words all that you would offer?
It's beneath you, Seppia.
The gods shall take ill notice --
Was it not their hands that saw my brother struck from my side?
Their providence that sheltered me beneath this very roof?
Do you not see it?
The gods have lead me upon path to Gaius.
As their will has removed Ilithyia from it.
I intend no harm.
I shit with the rest of those animals..
For child.
At least you will not die of hunger.
You bear no brand.
You are a free man?
I am Of the Republic, as you and yours.
Spartacus moves to destroy everything we hold of worth.
Then he moves too late in my regard.
Such a loss must weigh heavy in the passing of years.
My husband is a praetor of Rome.
And I of importance to him, being prized daughter of my clan, my child heir to its lineage and fortune --
I cannot free you.
We would both be absent fucking head before three steps could be taken.
You do not have to live this way.
All that was taken from you can yet be restored, with but simple command from my husband.
The sum of my loss is no small thing.
She claims it yours?
With passion of certainty.
She is a deceitful fucking snake, truth split by forked tongue.
Do you recall the night in Batiatus' villa, when you aided in transforming likeness into golden Apollo?
To lay with the Roman woman Licinia.
She wore the mask of Diana.
Yet beneath it was not Licinia.
Ilithyia.
None.
Nor should it hold any for you now.
Even if true, she tells you only to stay your hand.
She's a fool.
To know she carries heritage forever denied my own wife...
To make Glaber suffer as I have at his hand is a thing I have craved more than air and breath.
Yet in inflicting equal wound, how do I not become as the man himself?
A man my wife would turn from.
I was not certain you would desire this.
What man could not?
The fate of my heir does weigh mind.
That of your wife's?
A thing of lesser notice.
Is bond of marriage really such a cold affair?
There was a time.... when the love between us burned hot, bright as noon-day sun.
But day has turned to night, casting golden memories to shadow.
I would have you bask in the light, as a man of your worth deserves.
Albinius did not hold me to such esteem.
Nor the rest of the Senate.
Gaze into their eyes when you present Spartacus' head, and see estimation soar.
And my brother avenged.
Would that his death did not pain you so.
And I would return favor, if your wife falls prey to Spartacus, as my brother fell...
His attentions toward young Seppia prevent me from breaking words.
Ah, the freshness of youth.
The answer always the same.
Strike the bitch from fucking thought, as Glaber has already done --
Apologies.
I question sincerity of the word.
Speak it again.
Apologies.
When the day arrives... you shall greet my breath upon your neck as precious gift.
A gift from the gods...
Lucius.
Where do you go?
To clear troubled mind.
I would have the same.
Let us walk together for a moment, and break words.
And I would not see my brother fall.
We no longer stand as such.
And I would gladly take it.
It would only serve as mercy, releasing you from what you have done.
Then I stand condemned, until the afterlife takes me.
We must wait... till Spartacus relieves us of charge.
We must be quick then.
This is how you stand guard?
Apologies, we were....
Ah, we were -- we were, we were just -- we --
Take to your bed.
Gratitude.
That is what it is to be a slave.
I swear to the gods.
If Spartacus takes my life, the blood of his child will forever stain his own.
I will not let him be destroyed by this.
I will not let him kill you.
You will help me?
Have you lost mind?
If you take her life, the deed will weigh every breath.
You do not know my heart.
Spartacus --
Leave us.
You must have slept well.
It's an unfortunate thing.
Out.
Only to warning about the man you turn affections towards.
The time for them has passed.
Come.
I have something more tangible to show you --
What's happened?
A man comes with news of Ilithyia.
You claim to have knowledge of my wife?
More than claim.
She is being held by Spartacus.
How do you know this?
I am no fugitivus.
Just a tired old man, seeking what little peace he can before falling to eternal slumber.
Is such a thing possible?
Lay a hand on me and your wife dies.
Speak.
You are to enter the city of Atella on foot, just before rise of morning sun.
And Ilithyia?
Give arms to the enemies of Rome?
Let him pass.
I do not trust this.
Nor I.
Yet action must be taken.
Praetor, we can not aid them with means to forge further war upon us.
There are always choices.
I am old, but not a fool.
Glaber agrees to the terms?
If we do not honor word, we prove ourselves no better than the Romans.
We shall hold to it.
As would I, despite the company.
I would join as well.
For a cause you do not believe in?
Oenomaus believes in it.
Perhaps one day I shall too.
We will see this done, together.
Spartacus!
The old man claims you have my wife.
Cut from her dress.
Yet you do not claim her life.
I am not you.
I will not strike down a woman for the foolish acts of her husband.
I fear you are right.
You are not like me.
While I would do the same... to see you dead.
Kill them!
NOW!
Take cover!
Salvius!
Lucius --
You never intended to make trade?
I intended to send Spartacus to his death.
You will have him soon enough.
At price of wife, and the blessing she carries?
Ilithyia must return to this house.
The gods can descend from their fucking heavens if they wish to see her live!
Do you know what he has done?
My heart yet beats.
Gaius moves to avenge his death.
It's your brother's, is it not?
Yet the villain moves only upon command of Gaius Claudius Glaber.
No.
Kneel.
Please...
To see that blessing returned in kind, in the eyes of the only one that could ever know the true depth of your heart?
That is what your husband took from me.
I would take the same from him.
Yet he chose vengeance against me over your life.
Taking it would balance nothing.
Do not think it a kindness.
My father dissolves our marriage in favor of more promising opportunity.
Is there nothing left between us?
Memories only.
Can he be healed?
This man is beyond what you would warrant life.
His name is Oenomaus and he is more than common man.
A hundred more bodies pulled from the arena.
This was found in the wreckage.
The Gods have punished me by striking down my father.
It is not enough.
You must have pressing need, to venture out on such a night.
I fear the rising sun would dash hopes of it being met.
Short of time, long of coin.
What form of slave narrows your purpose?
I have a desire towards fighting men.
Sadly with the arena in Capua gone, there's less interest in be men of such talents.
Forgive the stench.
Savages east of the Rhine tend to favor their own shit.
I intended to have them scraped and oiled before auction, but I feared that would do little to improve their natural odor.
And how do you find the women?
As unpleasant as their men.
I would not recommend lustful hand placed upon...
Euer Leiden wird bald vorbei sein, Bruder.
Ihr sprecht unsere Sprache?
Auch das b'rtige Arschgesicht versteht unsere Sprache.
Keys, quickly.
Release them.
Wir folgen Spartacus.
You not om our lands.
Yet I was once bound in chains by the Romans, as you were.
A grievance I would see them pay dearly for.
Mehr R'merblut vergie'en?
Allein bei dem Gedanken geht mir einer ab!
He says they are with us.
His passing cause for my presence before you.
Passing?
Too gentle a word for how he was ushered from this life.
Blood and brains staining the pulvinus as he thought to flee Spartacus' wrath.
A thing that threatens to consume many innocent lives.
We had thought you were mangled corpse, the sundered beams of the arena your tomb.
The events of the day caused me absent proper mind.
It would have been happened had Spartacus not appeared.
And coin would have materialized the same.
Yet the past cannot be altered.
For your years of pleasing the crowd in the arena.
Now follow once noble monument, and collapse from sight.
You press beyond reason!
We have all suffered loss of those closest to us.
Even a senator of our great Republic, a man my wife called father, has been ripped from this world by Spartacus and his mongrel hordes.
And now beloved Seppius has fallen to this festering disease of rebellion.
Murdered by his own slaves, who even now spirited themselves away to join Spartacus against us.
We must be ever vigilant in these dark times.
We must bring to light even dimmest shadow of betrayal if it is revealed to us.
From this day forward, any slave who dares to whisper the name Spartacus shall be put to death.
Even those owned by a praetor of Rome.
Seize her.
Dominus!
I did nothing!
Dominus!
Do not speak against him.
Listen how she begs!
Pleading with the very tongue that only yesterday had praise for Spartacus upon it!
Praise for the slaves that murdered Seppius!
Praise most fortunate to be overheard by loyal wife.
Domina...
It is true.
I heard her speak it.
Would that she had more than one life to take.
Let this serve as warning to any slave who would conspire against us.
Apologies --
None deserved.
It was a foolish attempt.
Then I shall learn them.
Though perhaps it's best to keep him and Agron parted.
Naevia is blessed to be loved so deeply.
As are you, by Spartacus.
Crixus!
I taught you never to lower guard.
Now see Naevia to same instruction.
Oenomaus.
Yet we did not escaped deep wounds.
He was a fool to be gone so long from your de.
Such things are of the past.
Let us turn thought towards future.
And what joys it may hold.
Komm!
Lasst uns mit einer Umarmung die Br'derschaft besiegeln!
You've done the impossible.
Wir haben nur Wasser.
Ist auch besser so.
Unser kleiner Nemetes spricht verdammt nochmal die Wahrheit!
Our ranks swell.
I sense a deeper one.
These are all fucking Agron's people.
Our forces have doubled in a single day.
With people who are notranger to battle and blood.
And who will they follow?
I detected a hint of movement in your hips this time.
A subtle thrust as I bore down.
You begin to enjoy my cock inside of you?
I would have answer.
Yes. what?
Yes, Dominus.
Has a man ever heard so sweet a sound?
Your voice... your touch... the warmth of your thighs....
Is it a wonder Quintus fell beneath your spell?
Lavishing you with affection and gifts.
You call me dominus now, in his place.
It is only just that I present you with something in return.
How did you come by such bounty?
When this chest is full, it's worth shall see Ashur to even greater heights.
Yet for one such as you... something purchased with coin...
I know how fond Quintus was of the color.
I would have you wear it.
So that I may look up to you upon the balcony... and know that you are mine...
If only it had been so.
My father would yet grace this world.
And my slave would have had no cause to be crucified.
Let us review them, and bind them to cause with oath of loyalty.
Fall to attention!
Hold tongue... and give attention!
Who stands forth as your voice?
Recite the Sacramentum, and commit loyalty.
I, Octavius Tarsus, swear by Jupiter Optimus Maximus, that I shall uphold and defend the Republic.
I swear to have her enemies as my enemies and her friends as my friends.
You've taken to your old color.
I fear it no longer suits me.
I pledge my body and life to the Republic and to its army under the leadership of Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.
Will they be enough?
Added to my own troops, yes.
They will be enough to bring Spartacus to justice.
I do not seek justice.
I seek vengeance.
By Jupiter Optimus Maximus, I so swear.
By Jupiter Optimus Maximus, we so swear.
Gratitude for your kindness.
Know that I have treasured it.
I leave in the morning for my uncle's villa in Pompeii.
I would not have you upon the road while the threat of Spartacus still remains.
I will send word to your uncle, if you find solace in the thought.
Your presence offers great comfort.
Was it so recent that I thought him weak?
I now gaze into his eyes and tremble at what lurks behind them.
Do not work yourself into an unfortunate state.
My heart would follow to the rocks below.
I cannot live like this.
Nor I.
The last of our meat.
I forgot how much my kin devour upon a sitting.
Much seems to have slipped mind of late.
Were there any others that may have afforded the same?
Two.
News I would have cared to know.
So a among us may know their thoughts.
They will prove great asset.
I give you my word.
Cunt.
Nothing's free.
I heard you were dead.
Carried to the afterlife with all the others that fell beneath the arena.
I yet breathe.
My purse however has suffered fatal blow.
I have no coin to prypen thighs.
They may yet widen, of their own accord.
A miracle lacking profit.
For you and your master.
Except for Spartacus.
What form of man was he?
You speak of dangerous things.
You have no coin then?
A few denarii for passage away from this fucking city.
Strike Spartacus from your thoughts, and come with me...
The mighty Gannicus.
It is joyous occasion, to find you yet alive.
With ripe offering perched upon lap.
Apologies.
It is unforgivable to come between man and cunt, yet I must have words with my brother.
An enticing creature.
Of course you never lacked the attention of fine men.
If you seek words, break them and be done.
The years have not seen you to better manners.
Nor you to better company.
I would advise caution.
Bound by duty to restore order.
By nailing little girls to the cross?
Yes, I was there upon the sands when you became a god of the arena!
It was a sight never to be forgotten!
Gannicus, besting twenty gladiators in the primus of the opening day!
And his reward?
Proof of freedom, demanded by adoring crowd!
Show them.
I am sure they would be eager to lay eyes upon such rare marvel.
No?
As I know the praetor will be most pleased with the presence of your company...
I find it surprising that you are still of this world.
More so that you did not think it wise to present yourself at sooner convenience.
Apologies.
Gannicus has always been a man of few words.
You aim too low.
The gods have truly blessed him.
As they now bless me, with his presence.
I was moved by the reaction of the crowd, when you stepped upon the sands.
Even tarnished by blood and calamity, such a thing yet can hold value...
Your rudis.
And its price?
A simple oath.
Edging yourself to my command.
Lucretia was also once thought victim of Spartacus.
Yet now stands a powerful symbol, used to calm spreading concern.
I would add you as such.
A former slave of the House of Batiatus, now sworn to bring errant brothers to justice.
It appears you already have one of those.
Ashur's talents are of the shadows.
And if I no longer crave for such clamor?
You're a free man.
Your fate is your own.
Praetor.
Forgive me, Praetor, but Gannicus cannot be trusted.
The same once said of you.
Yet here you stand.
See one of your men to follow.
If Gannicus attempts to leave Capua, crucify him.
Is there no other way?
You were right about Gaius.
The man he was no longer peers from behind his eyes.
He will not be swayed by words or gentle touch.
Only blood can set us free now.
Lucretia...
It will hurt but for a moment.
Lift your dress.
Neapolis?
An obvious conclusion.
Dispatch men to Neapolis.
Question anyone who may have seen where they were headed after liberation.
Praetor.
Gaius...
Ilithyia!
What has happened to her?
It ia sign from the gods.
One carried by the child yet to breathe life.
I will have her carried to Rome as soon as she's able.
With trusted guard to watch over her at all times, until my return.
I shall accompany her and tend to her needs.
Apologies, Praetor.
Lucretia's a dear friend to your wife, yet offers greater comfort to Capua.
I fear the people will fall to despair, absent her divine presence.
Wise counsel.
I have no knowledge of soldiers and war.
I know only the ways of a gladiator.
I can think of no fiercer army, so instructed.
Open their eyes to what a man can do given cause.
As you have opened mine.
I hunt with Agron and his people, to better gauge them.
I will lend aid when I return.
Agron.
You hunt without me,... when you knew my intention.
They woke before the sun, and were eager to take advantage of freedom.
We hunt.
Catch meat.
And Roman drink!
I did not know these forests were stocked with such.
Where did you come by this?
A wagon along the road --
No one see.
All dead.
Lasst uns ein Fest bereiten!
Wir zeigen diesen armseligen Schei'ern, wie man einen draufmacht!
Glad I risked my life for this lot.
They see us to propeforce.
They see us to nothing but discovery.
We are not ready for a direct assault.
Something even a child could see.
The pup has found himself nothing but a pack of wild dogs.
Ones that will never follow a fucking Gaul.
Apologies for leaving without you.
I question that boy's sincerity.
May the gods bless you...
There's talk among many of us towards joining his cause.
You knew her?
The city is filled with ears straining for whispers of betrayal.
It is filled with eyes as well...
Attempt to leave the city, and share a cross beside your friend.
I am not your slave.
The oracle of fucking riddles.
Come to plain words.
I saw something in your eyes, when you stood before Glaber.
I something beyond a man weighing decision.
The gods bless you with gi to see into my thoughts now, do they?
And what would you have me do?
Take up offer and turn on those that I once called brother?
No.
I would have you end the life of Gaius Claudius Glaber.
He is desperate to claim Spartacus' life.
So consumed, that he now stands more threat than the Thracian himself.
And what difference would it make?
Rome would only send another to take his place.
Spartacus blames Glaber for part in his wife's death.
Remove him from the world, and the scales of blood will be balanced.
Spartacus will drift from Rome.
I could distract any that remain posted to the villa entry, giving opportunity for a single man to take Glabe's life while he sleeps.
And Spartacus to receive the blame.
You have lost mind.
The whole world has slipped from reason.
I seek only to restore it.
Rid yourself of Ashur's man.
Reiss ihm den verdammten Schwanz ab!
Wenn du trinkst, stehst du Sedulus an Grobheit nichts nach.
Ich stehe verdammt noch mal keinem Mann... in irgendetwas nach.
Your people, they lift spirit.
Not all are so moved.
Ich fordere Dich zum Schaukampf, Bruder!
Perhaps they'll kill each other, and give proper cause for celebration.
You are an impossible man.
I know not your words.
Lugo will teach!
They are a boisterous people.
Sing with me!
Now is not the time for such things.
Is it ever?
No.
I will try and wrest a drink from Lugo for us to share.
And in the act, aid Oenomaus in escape.
It is a thing of no matter.
You shall find me again to your arms.
Sooner than expected.
I sway Gannicus to forever remove Gaius from concern.
When it is done I will raise clamor, and see Gannicus follow to the afterlife.
Ilitia.
It's time.
Dies ist keine Nacht zum Wasser trinken.
Wine.
The Gaul, yes.
Tell him his eyes I not like.
Your eyes better...
Crixus.
Sedullus.
Sedullus!
Calm yourselves!
Spartacus!
Enough!
Is this what you are?
Animals, demanding slaughter?
Or join Sedullus in death.
I follow Spartacus.
And call no man my kin that does not stand so.
And Lugo follow.
Praetor, pressing concerns.
Gannicus has made his decision.
I can't believe you guys are still staring over there.
Some mothers tend to breast-feed for a lot longer these days.
It's called detachment parenting.
The kid is my height.
Don't get any ideas.
Hi, what can I get you?
He's obviously good drink-wise.
I'll have tea and a turkey club.
Anything for him?
It's my father.
He could hang himself with his belt.
Do not give me that look.
Everything I've ever owned is being auctioned off to the public.
Well, well, here comes the sun, and the moon is looking great too.
Oh, Earl, your flirting is just the right amount of dirty, and that's not easy.
Evening, Sophie.
As you know, we have now been together for 468 sexual encounters.
Oh, just say yes.
How is this romantic?
How is this romantic?
You better give it to me before she comes out here and lights you on fire.
Oh, reach for me like that again and we'll be playing a different game called "guess which part of Han I cut off."
Now, can I have my catalog back?
You brought this in here?
I just think it's really insensitive and stuff.
I mean, what are you thinking?
And you don't think this color is happening?
I think we're all clear about what needs to happen right now.
Wow, this prison's a lot better than the last one.
Max, I know your idea of a country club's an abandoned car in the woods, but look around.
There's security cameras and bars on the windows.
All right, so it's a rough country club, where the strongest golfers make the caddies their bitch.
Martin Channing.
Okay, fine, your dad is awesome.
You want me to smuggle something in?
I know it will be hard for you, but I promise it'll be worth it.
There's one thing at that auction that I really care about that I want you to have.
The sculpture of me as a five-year-old?
Martin, you know I'd do anything for you.
No matter what she says, make sure she gets that cup.
You follow me?
No, you can't, miss.
Oh, follow you, like follow your thought.
It's important for her, and it's important for the both of you for your futures, all right?
The cup, Martin?
It happened to you twice already.
We have to go get that cup.
Why?
He said we needed it for our future, then he winked.
Well, what does a loving cup look like?
Does it have, like, a wood base?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I hear what you're saying, but I just have one big question.
How much are we willing to bid?
No, about my disguise.
I know I'm a brunette, but do I have bangs?
It's the least expensive look you can do and still get laid.
Wow, you had all these closets, and no one in your family is gay?
My cousin Peter and I used to climb in here and play French Revolution.
I'd be Marie Antoinette, and he'd help me put my hair up in a high chignon.
Oh, now I'm feeling bad for his wife.
Oh, this is from the summer house.
I'm asking you to put it down right now.
Hey, you might wanna relax the attitude.
You really think my friend Jennifer Love Hewitt, international movie and Lifetime channel superstar, is gonna steal a used spoon?
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.
The auction is starting, ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, hello, Caroline.
Sophie, I apologize for the other day.
Yah, now, he's going to buy me something golden.
Yah, I want to be covered in gold.
I want a golden shower.
$60,000?
And sold.
Wow, you're getting everything.
Yes, we are.
Aren't we, Miss Pickle?
No, dear, I'm not insane.
A 19th century gold and ivory bedside table...
I'm a very lucky man, yes?
We start the opening bid on this item at $50,000.
I'm out.
- 50,000.
I jumped 14 hurdles in the rain with walking pneumonia.
Then, I'm out.
Sorry, the Rainbow Room really sucked me dry.
Hm, guess what else is pretty dry right now?
Do I hear 60?
60.
I know, but wouldn't it be camp to see Miss Pickle taking a bath in that for my Christmas card?
Do I hear 70?
So did we, I broke my hymen getting that thing.
Is that why it's called a loving cup?
Do I hear 225?
Don't be so sure.
I was bisexual till I was 62.
Look, Katie Holmes really wants this, and she's been through a lot.
- Yes, I'm rich!
Did you just say "I'm"?
You, me, Chestnut, jet skis.
Okay, here we go.
We can just go over there and open it right next to that thing where you and your little queen cousin played dress-up.
Seriously, how could I not have known that?
When we played Cowboys and Indians, he played the Indian's makeup artist.
It's empty?
Son of a bitch.
Martin, we just have one question.
The money in the cup, Daddy.
Which, for anyone who might be watching my lips, we were going to give all to charity.
Sweetheart, why do you think I would hide money, besides the fact I'm here for hiding money?
Well, that might have been my fault.
You were supposed to take care of me, and you didn't.
But I really did wanna give you something for your future, sweetheart, which is why I asked Max to make sure that you got that cup.
Well, I think I'm done for today.
Boy, I've dreaded the day you looked at me like this.
Now that it's here, it's even worse.
I only hope that one day you could look at me again the way you did the day you won that cup.
I love you, honey.
Look, if it's any consolation, I now see how that could've happened to him.
In his final moments, he told me the truth... that our family's wealth had been i0 built on the suffering of others.
That he failed our city, and that it was up to me to save it and right his wrongs.
Get the chopper back now.
Mr. Redman claims refunding the Halcyon pension plan has always been his intent.
But sources say Redman was coerced by the vigilante.
This guy gets more air-time than the Kardashians, right?
Five years on an island and you still know who they are.
Do you have any questions about today, Oliver?
It's fine, Walter, I've been in a courtroom before.
Four times by my estimate.
You know, there was the DUI, the assault on that paparazzi douchebag, stealing that taxi, which was just awesome, by the way, and who could forget peeing on the cop?
I wish everyone would.
I'd hang, but we're headed to court.
Fair enough.
There was a storm.
And in those five years, it was that one thought that kept me going.
Your Honor, we move to vitiate the death-in-absentia filed after Oliver's disappearance at sea aboard the Queen's Gamut five years ago.
The Queen family is only entitled to one miracle, I'm afraid.
Uh, Mom, that was a little bit heavier than I was expecting it to be.
Last week, you couldn't wait to get to the company.
Emily Nocenti.
Oliver just got back from five years on an uncharted island.
That's all I have to say, thank you.
This happens to you a lot, doesn't it?
How much is a life worth?
A life of a man, a good man, a stevedore on the docks of the city in which we live.
The plaintiff will prove by a preponderance of evidence that Victor Nocenti learned that his boss, that man sitting right there, Martin Somers, was taking bribes from the Chinese Triads to smuggle drugs into our city.
The city's police and the D.A. can't stop him... or won't.
You shut this trial down, do you understand me?
There won't be a second warning.
I hired you to protect my son.
Now, I'm not a professional bodyguard, but it seems to me that the first requirement would be managing to stay next to the man you're hired to protect.
With all due respect, ma'am, I never had a client who didn't want my protection.
Now where do you think my son is going on these chaperone-less excursions?
Ma'am, I truly do not know.
And he truly doesn't.
Then perhaps you'd like to share with me you know, where it is you run off to.
I've been alone for five years.
I see.
I promise to introduce her if it ever gets to the exchanging first names stage...
No, I'd rather you promise to take Mr. Diggle with you on your next rendezvous.
It's not safe, you've already been abducted once.
There is a maniac out there, hunting the wealthy.
Thank you.
Sorry to give you so much grief.
And don't bother trying to pickpocket my stash this time, because I'm gonna go get drunk instead.
Thea, do you think this is what Dad would want for you?
Dead people don't want anything.
You've been home a week and all you do is avoid Mom, ignore Walter, and judge me.
Don't wait up.
Well, I owe you an apology, Mr. Somers.
We come all the way down to your docks, and it turns out, you don't need the police after all.
Isn't this a conflict of interest, Detective?
After all, your daughter is suing me.
You and your daughter don't want to find out what I'm capable of when I get emotional.
As you can see, Oliver, we've modernized quite a bit.
Mom, it makes me nervous when you ask me to sit down.
Besides, Walter is doing a very good job here.
You said that you wanted to be a different person.
And you are Robert Queen's son.
Everyone here understands that this transition is really difficult for you.
You know, five years ago, your irresponsibility was somewhat charming.
It is a lot less so now.
The driver will be here in a minute.
There's no place like home?
No, just the opposite.
Get you to open up, be somebody you're not sure you are anymore.
Dad?
Well, we anticipate that Somers' attorney will try and paint you as blinded by grief or looking to make a buck.
They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.
Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.
And it won't.
What's going on?
Um, Emily, let's go grab a cup of coffee, okay?
Stay there.
End of discussion.
And you've made them angry.
Thank you for coming.
Anything for a friend.
For which you're paid a lot of money.
I don't get paid enough to have arrows shot at me.
She won't stop until she burns you, me, and then the entire Triad to the ground.
Then we kill Miss Lance.
Attorney for shipping magnate, Martin Somers, has confirmed his client has no intention of testifying, maintaining his innocence in the wrongful death of Victor Nocenti.
I don't want to talk about it.
I need to get better at talking about what happened to me there.
About a month after the funerals, Mom stopped going out.
Pretty soon, she stopped talking altogether.
I mean, stupid stuff.
Like what I was doing that day, what boy I had a crush on...
And then sometimes, I'd ask you, beg you, to find your way home to me.
There are two cop cars outside.
So, you thought you'd start with the first person you pushed away.
I haven't really had time to redecorate.
I'm a jerk.
I thought about many things on the island, but there was one thing that I thought about every day.
I actually dreamed about it, and I promised myself that if I ever got a chance to do it again, I'd do it with you.
Eat ice cream.
This is as good as I remember.
I can't exactly picture you as master of the universe.
I have been on the receiving end of your father's disapproval.
He blames himself more than he blames you.
He thinks that, you know, maybe if he and Sarah were closer, she would have told him about the boat trip.
You apologized already.
And it'll never be enough.
Daddy!
Oh, thank God.
Mr. Diggle, thank you.
Feel free to run as many red lights in the city as you want.
It seems like whenever you're with one of my daughters, people die.
The knife.
Yes.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
Triad bitch screwed up the hit on Lance.
Now, the Triad is gonna erase every ounce of evidence of their smuggling operation, including me.
We need to move, now.
Your job is not going after people like the Triad or Somers.
My job is to use the law to fight for what is right.
I want the truth about Victor Nocenti.
Whose?
Freeze!
You twitch and you're dead.
Bow down, hands up.
You son of a bitch.
Look, I just don't want him to find out anything, okay?
Oliver has been through a lot.
Tommy, we've all been through a lot.
See, I was supposed to come here today, and I'm supposed to take my rightful place at the company.
Prodigal son returns home and becomes the heir apparent.
But I'm not my father.
Martin Somers, the CEO of Starling Port, was arrested last night for the murder of Victor Nocenti.
He is also being accused of accepting cash, including over $10 million in bribes.
Well, we can pursue the civil suit if you want, but the D.A. now has no choice, with Mr. Somers' confession, to prosecute him.
Thank you so much for fighting for us.
Well, thank you for being brave enough to let me.
Yeah, I was filling out reports on the shootout at the port last night and getting grilled about how I let that archer get away.
Yeah, well, whoever he is, it seems like he's trying to help.
The city doesn't need that kind of help, okay?
Take it down.
- And mine.
For centuries, supernatural creatures have lived among us.
They are vampires, werewolves, dopplegangers, witches.
And even hybrids.
She didn't even keep my blood down.
Our town has always been different...
Stefan, I'm losing it.
Feed from me.
But now there are strange things happening that no one can explain.
Oh, I see we're still fighting.
That hunter jacked Tyler Lockwood of his werewolf venom last night, so basically he's got vampire poison in a bottle, and I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna eat him.
That was before she turned.
Thank you for doing this.
Elena, please just let me do this for you.
The vampire hunter knows that Damon's a vampire and that I know Damon.
Hiding at home would be more suspicious.
Tyler got shot in front of half the town.
Everyone's a little freaked.
If only they knew the real story.
Who the hell are you two?
- More deputies?
- Not exactly.
They're hybrids.
I was halfway to Chicago when I heard you were attacked.
I had hoped to leave Mystic Falls for good, but duty calls.
I should have killed you for the little stunt you and your friends pulled... stopping my heart, leaving me in a coffin to rot.
Yeah, well, you used my body as an escape hatch, then kissed my girlfriend, so maybe we're even.
Not even close.
But you hybrids are a dying breed.
I can't make more of you, and I won't have anyone taking liberties with the ones I have left.
Consider them your new bodyguards.
So first time we've been back in Alaric's classroom.
The first period, and I'm ready to bawl my eyes out.
Morning, everyone.
It's a pretty enormous hatchet.
Well, I'm feeling generous of spirit.
New house, huh?
Did your brother finally kick you out?
Well, your boyfriend liked me once.
Actually, a lot more than once.
Why are you still in town, Rebekah?
There you are.
Rebekah sent me to see if you were ok.
I'm fine, Heather.
I'm not.
What's wrong, Elena?
Getting hungry?
No, g-get away from me.
But she's so delicious.
And I couldn't help but overhear that there's a vampire hunter roaming the hallways.
How inconvenient for you.
You mind telling me who you are and why I'm here?
Because you saw this.
No, I call this a hunter's mark, as in vampire hunter.
Jeremy, I know your family's history in this town, so you playing dumb just makes you look dumb.
Why the show and tell?
I don't even know you.
Because it's invisible to anyone but another hunter or potential hunter.
How about we just leave the murdering to Damon?
I feel like this day is severely lacking in fun.
I just have to go home and change first.
Hayley?
I should have called.
I didn't want anybody to follow me back.
Werewolves weren't safe around Klaus, and you shouldn't be here either.
Well, the least you could do is pour me some fancy, rich-people scotch.
Sure.
It's an adorable exploding kitten.
Why didn't you call your brother?
So how well did you know pastor Young?
Nice crazy guy.
He wrote a letter about sacrifice and war brewing in Mystic Falls.
What does he mean, "a greater evil is coming"?
I mean, we have great enough evil already.
You'd think.
How'd you get stuck on hunter duty?
Stefan had a physics test.
You are a good brother.
I'm the bad brother.
You're strung up to a bomb while Stefan plays vampire with a girl who broke your heart, but you are doing a very good job of acting like it doesn't suck.
Ok, I think that should be good.
I never wanted to hurt you.
What'd you say last time?
Hickeys?
Kinky girlfriend.
Who you letting feed on you?
Sure about that?
Tell me which one of your High School friends is a bloodsucker.
Thank you.
When you wake up, she'll be long gone.
Hope you plan on cleaning this up.
You weren't looking for alcohol, were you?
Do you think I'd actually leave the last remaining white oak stake where any vampire could just walk in and take it?
What happened to you?
Hunter mishap.
Damon, don't bring him into this.
Perish the thought he might actually be useful, Elena.
You staying for the show, or...
I'm finding that stake.
You got a vampire for me?
No, but I know where you can find one.
There's a doctor, Meredith Fell, she uses vampire blood in surgery.
I think she has a deal with one, her blood for his.
You see, that's the problem.
Nah, we're going to the hospital.
Or who died here.
You're fixating.
No, I'm just quietly hating.
This is mine now.
Thank you.
Why don't you have a drink?
It'll help you let go.
April's here.
I'm gonna go say hi.
I ditched Rebekah's ditching party.
What's with all the testosterone?
You're a new face.
A little bad, mostly repulsive.
But I'd rather hang with you.
You know, you used to read me bedtime stories.
If my dad could see me now.
My first weekend home from boarding school, my dad smelt cigarette smoke on my clothes before I even walked in the door.
He would have noticed a gas leak in the house.
So you... you don't think that it was an accident?
I know there's no investigation, that everyone's calling it an accident, but the shooting at the church, it just feels like... like something wicked this way comes.
Hey, April, why don't you go look around the house, and I'll find you in a little bit.
Did I forget to uninvite you?
Did you blow up her dad's house to get revenge on the council?
I don't give a damn about some dodgy middle-aged council.
You come into my house, throw around false accusations, and then you have the nerve to drink my beer?
My ring.
Give it back.
Get it yourself.
Well, if you want to kill her, I'm not gonna stop you.
But, see, here's what'll happen.
She's quite fetching, that Hayley.
Where is she?
- Whatever you think you know...
I said stop!
Klaus, where's Tyler?
Tyler's otherwise occupied making big decisions about honesty and what not.
Is there anything I can do?
I'm going after the vampire hunter, so if he'd like to join...
He wouldn't.
Stay here.
Is a hospital really the best place for a germophobe?
What's wrong with me?
Damon said the hunter had werewolf venom.
Oh, my God.
I'm surprised you came to my party.
Well, I thought about it.
You explained why you ran me off the bridge, so least I could do is explain how I feel.
The truth is, Rebekah, I think you're amazing.
There's more to you than meets the eye, isn't there?
Why am I thinking about you?
Let's play that game for a moment, shall we?
Why are you still here?
Um, honestly?
Um, picking up trash is a hell of a lot better than sitting at home alone, thinking about the family I no longer have.
You'd be surprised.
You told me the plan was to lead him to the storage room.
You left out the part about blowing up a hospital, with patients who are sick and fragile and who don't need things exploding down the hall from them.
You know you're not going anywhere, Damon, and I am not your new partner in vampire crime.
Fix things with Stefan and Elena.
Don't let your pride leave you all alone.
You grew into yourself when you became a vampire.
And I want her to be able to enjoy it without all the guilt and shame that I went through.
And there was a moment today when she did.
And when I'm with her, every bone in my body tells me to join her, to enjoy it.
I love her, and I don't want to hold her back.
But you don't know how to be around her and still resist that urge.
Damon promised he'd help me stay off the edge, but, uh, he and I, we're not in a very good place right now, not when it comes to her.
I just thought you're so good at it, at being a vampire.
Come to me whenever you want, and I won't let you lose control.
Stefan warned me that I would feel things more powerfully, but, Matt, the hatred that I felt today...
Hey, Elena, you sure you wanna take that much?
It's ok.
What have I done?
Nothing you should be ashamed of.
You are a vampire now.
You just have to learn the right way to be one.
what... what did you mean when you said I was one of the five?
You don't know your own history?
Well, let's just say it's made you the most well protected vampire hunter in town.
Yeah?
Don't tell me you've forgotten the sound of my voice.
I could never forget anything about you.
I thought maybe you were still upset about Vienna.
How could anyone be upset about Vienna?
I'd like to make it up to you.
Well, I'd like you to make it up to me too.
I'm staying at the deluxe.
You can't intrude if you're invited.
I made one of your favorites.
So I figured this would be a good place to start.
What can I do to help?
Hey, how about we get out of here?
Got a big job.
You're the way I want to celebrate.
You got a tight, little ass...
And the chicken fingers.
Maybe it's you who gave me the wrong idea.
Thanks for the beer...
And the chicken fingers.
You owe me.
Just cool it, all right?
Let's not take this anyplace you'll regret.
You just keep digging this hole deeper.
I like that.
That's better.
Well, if you like that, you're going to love this.
We, it sort of makes us even.
Can I just say that you look beautiful?
Well, you look beautiful too.
Cheers.
I love your home.
But it's this one...
Straight out of the black forest.
Hear that?
That is amazing.
So what was Tokyo about?
We have no secrets.
Well, maybe a few.
Let's just say a certain foreign minister had to be convinced that putting my family first was in his own best interest.
I've never agreed with how your family treated you.
I suspect you have your own vision of the future.
I've often wondered if I have any part in it.
So do I.
You ever coming back?
To Vienna?
How about your brother's terms?
I heard you killed your cousin.
I certainly hope nothing like that ever happens to me.
Get in.
You've put me in a dilemma.
You killed someone who's supposedo do aob for me.
He was trying to rape me.
Well, you handled it rather well.
Makes me wonder if you've done it before.
Neat party trick.
Your body temp is elevated, and your pulse is a little quicker than it should be, for someone acting so cool.
We have three options.
But I'm willing to cut you a break.
You do the same job, I'll pay you the same money.
How much?
10,000 up front, 10,000 upon delivery.
15,000 on delivery.
And what is it exactly I'm delivering?
When do you want it done?
You got 24 hours.
How did we meet?
And then what happened?
I found this at a garage sale.
I don't think they had any idea who he was, and he's one of my absolute favorites.
And he only had one leg because of a sledding accident in Salzburg when he was just seven years old.
And she needs to go.
Angelina, what are you...
I don't really know what's going on here.
You're not.
Fuchsbau?
I thought you were dead.
What do you think you're doing here?
I'm here to kill you.
A Konigschlange.
I don't even know a Konigschlange, for good reason.
If I would've turned him down, he would've just gotten somebody else to do it.
I figured you'd want to know.
Well, I want more than want to know.
Angelina, did anyone tell you why they want me dead?
All I know is that I got 24 hours to deliver you dead.
So I thought I'd come over and help you pack.
I'm not going anywhere.
This is different... it has nothing to do with you, okay?
This is me.
I'm not telling him anything.
Then why did you even come here if you're not going to help?
- When did you ask me?
- About five months ago.
It's a little weird for you to tell me how I felt.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now, so can I come over later?
There might not be a later.
Somebody's trying to kill me.
What?
Is he okay?
Uh, doesn't sound too good
Juliette...
How do you know someone wants you dead?
Well, Nick, this is where it gets a little awkward.
Well, did you get a death threat, a-a phone call, a letter, what?
Look, Nick, the person who was hired to kill me... and I think you'd agree, Nick, this shows real character.
This person actually told me they were being offered $25,000... oh, for God's sake, Monroe, just tell him.
You?
Put your hands behind your back.
I didn't know who else to turn to.
But the thing is, there's like 23 hours here before she's supposed to kill me.
So, if neither of you can see fit to put aside your personal differences, I guess I'll just wait till the next hired murderer shows up at my door.
Maybe I'll be ready, maybe I won't.
Okay, so we got, like, a truce here or something.
What's his name?
If I knew his name, I would've told Monroe, so he wouldn't have to call you.
It's rosalee.
You guys going to be okay here for, like, a second?
How did he find you?
So that's three people you've killed.
That you know of.
I want to apologize for leaving so abruptly.
You don't have to apologize for anything.
Nick's there?
Yeah, it's a totally discombobulated situation.
Well, I just called to say good-bye.
What?
That's how she got the job, kind of by default.
They gave her a phone.
So you understand why I called you?
Yeah, well, you must have pissed off somebody at some point.
Look, right now I have to get you someplace safe for the next 24 hours.
And I'm going to need you to show me where you met these guys.
How do I know that you're not going to arrest me as soon as we walk out the door?
I'm not interested in you right now.
I'm interested in helping Monroe.
Right now, no.
I mean, there was a time... it was a long time ago...
You know, Monroe's convinced that you can figure out who this guy is, but I'm not so convinced.
But if they're willing to pay me 25 "g" s to do it, there's got to be a long list of people lining up for it after me.
Can I ask you something?
Uh, sure.
I know.
Woge.
In other words, if I don't want you to see me, you can't.
But if I do, believe me, you will.
I want you to see me.
That was amazing.
Stay here.
Nick Burkhardt, Portland p.D.
What brings you up here?
Looks as if a few people beat the hell out of him with an ax or a pipe.
It was self-defense.
His partner.
Now, if you'll, uh... if you'll look at these footprints right here, that's the bigger print, that's the smaller one.
And he probably got what he deserved.
Come on, boys.
I think I got something.
You got one hell of a partner here.
I know this piece of dirt.
Buxton Jacobs, he's been in and out... rape, assault, you name it.
Can't say I'm sorry to see he got what he deserved.
Must've been one kick-ass woman to take him on.
I think we're done here.
Easy on the eyes too.
Pretty cute.
I thought you were interested in the truth.
He had it all wrong.
The dirtbag's cell phone.
The last call he got was from the guy who hired him.
I didn't even think about it until we got here.
Yeah, this is Detective Burkhardt.
Is he the Konigschlange?
No, that's the little guy that put the gun to my head.
But I want to hear the conversation.
Can I go now?
How are you going to handle this?
I'm going to use my charms.
What the hell are you doing here?
I could kill you right now and walk away from this.
You think he would have given you ten grand if this was a setup?
Otherwise, this could all come down on me.
So is it personal, or is it business?
It's none of yours, in either case.
I'll tell you what I know, but you keep it to yourself.
Okay, so why?
He's friends with a Grimm.
What Grimm?
All I know is there's one in Portland.
And he's friends with this guy we're going to hit.
So your boss wants to send a message?
By who?
I don't know that stuff.
But someone decided to kill this guy to set an example... working with a Grimm is not good for you.
That arson case we had.
You don't forget one like that.
I've been working with her, trying to figure out who's behind this.
You kidding me?
Bring her in.
So I guess you're up to speed on how the world really works.
Getting there.
You tell him?
Tell me what?
What, those same guys who had me beat up before?
I don't think so, not for $25,000.
This is a bigger deal.
Well, who, then?
The guy who hired me is working for somebody else.
Somebody wants to send a message to all of us.
And we're not going to find out who's behind this.
I'm in the spice shop with Nick and Hank... and me.
We wouldn't be here if we didn't.
You were meeting with the dragon's tongue.
I was just thinking about you.
What were you thinking?
I was wondering what time I'd see you tonight.
How about you come to my room in a couple of hours?
Can't wait.
No, no, and no.
We can't do this.
Rosalee, how does it work?
It's called tetrodotoxin.
Add green kohler vat, and for all intents and purposes, you're dead.
Okay, so it's like suspended animation.
And I'm not interested in leaving Portland.
I got a lot of good things going on here.
There are some problems, you know.
One, you wake up too soon, in which case, I don't know, they kill you.
The other is, you don't wake up at all.
I guess in that case, I get the money.
- And which would you prefer?
Well, I'm willing to take the risk.
Monroe...
And that includes you.
I am not going to let that happen.
Can we get this done?
I'd like to get paid.
Drive to lake forest, South entrance, three Miles in.
Rosalee, we don't have much time here.
- Where is she?
- She just left the hotel.
Her plane's still on the tarmac.
She just filed a flight plan.
What does that mean?
"Hopefully not for the last time."
If he doesn't wake up in two hours, you have to respirate him.
If his face goes white or his hands start to curl, he's running out of time.
I got it.
Monroe...
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.
I'm here.
Hank, whatever goes down out here tonight... yeah, I know... off the books.
Show me.
When the body's delivered.
The body is right here.
How long I got to hang around for that, huh?
They're right there.
We've got another car coming in.
No compunction killing your own kind...
I admire that.
Pay her.
He's alive!
Who hired you?
- Was he a...
- Yeah.
That woman got away.
Be careful.
Let me deal with this our way.
I should have known.
- You going to kill me?
- That depends.
On what?
On so many things.
Now, tell me everything.
Monroe's fine.
Now.
Youneedadigitalcamera.
Thenwhatareyou doing?
Documentinghistory.
What the hell?
So all you have to do is, like, look through their transcripts and figure out which class they all had in common.
Yeah,exceptforthe fact that the rave promoter Kara wasn't in Harris's class.
Allright,fine.
I'll allow the remote possibility, but give me a motive.
I mean, why would this kid want most of the 2006 swim team and its coach dead?
Isn'titobvious?
Yeah,thatwouldbeinthe station, where I no longer work.
Trust...trustScott?
ScottI trust.
It's2 :00inthemorning.
Believeme,Iwouldn'tbe here if it wasn't extremely important.
Becauseallthemurderswere committed by Jackson, except for one, you remember?
Areyoucrazy?
Allright,fine,then look at his jacket, huh?
How many people do you know who wear black leather jackets?
Millions,literally.
He'stalkingto my mom.
Scott,youknowhow many people I deal with in a day?
Scott,I alreadytalked to the police about this.
Okay,mom,I'mgonnatake a picture and send it to you.
Doyourecognizehim ?
Do you remember him?
Scott, what's going on?
Andiftheymatch,that puts Matt at the scene of three murders.
Acouplehours before you got there.
Allright,dad,ifone'san incident, two's a coincidence, and three's a pattern, what's four?
I need you to answer me, Derek.
You're gonna be weak for several hours.
But, as usual, not a particularly competent one.
How about you tell me what you're doing here, and why you're helping me.
Helping your family actually used to be a pretty important part of my life.
Helping you was a promise I made to your mother.
What Peter managed to do doesn't come without a price.
He'll be physically weak, so he'll rely on the strength of his intelligence, his cunning.
He's gonna come at you, Derek.
He'll try to twist his way inside your head, preying on your insecurities.
I don't trust anyone.
Something tells me... it's going exactly the way he wants it to.
Matt?
It's Matt, right?
Matt, whatever's going on, I guarantee you there's a solution that doesn't involve a gun.
You know, it's funny you say that, because I don't think you're aware of just how right you are.
I know you don't wanna hurt people.
You three weren't on my list, but I could be persuaded.
And one way is to try dialing somebody on your cell phone, like McCall is doing.
That... that could definitely get someone hurt.
What, are you gonna kill everyone in here?
No, that's what Jackson's for.
I just think about killing them, and he does it.
Sweetheart.
I don't wanna talk.
Then leave.
What is it?
As you know, your mother wrote a suicide note to explain away our difficult situation to the police.
She wrote this note to explain it to you.
But reading this made me sorry I hadn't tried to be.
Because if this were my mother, if these words were written for me, I don't know how I could sit still until someone paid for her death.
Any pity I'd have for Derek and his pack would be burned on by a white-hot desire for retribution, or a kind of blood and destruction that would have Derek and his wolves howling not for mercy, but for their own sweet deaths.
Sounds like your mom's here, McCall.
Matt, don't do this.
If you don't move... now, I'm gonna kill Stiles first, and then your mom.
Open it.
Oh, thank God.
Well, Derek, not everyone's lucky enough to be a big, bad werewolf.
What do you turn into?
Abominable snowman.
Get him off of me.
It must kinda suck, though, to have all that power taken away from you with just a little cut to the back of the neck.
Is that her?
Do what I tell you to and I won't hurt her.
You, take him in there.
You... with me.
You scared me, where is every...
Wait, baby... back, back!
Mom, mom, stop, mom!
I said get back!
Scott.
Now, get up, or I shoot her next!
I mean, I can help stop the bleeding.
If you keep talking, I'm gonna put the next bullet through his head.
What... what book?
The bestiary.
What do you want it for, anyway?
I need answers.
Answers to what?
To this.
And he definitely wouldn't have mentioned Derek.
The sheriff's station?
Maybe him and the one controlling him.
How many do they keep on in a night shift?
Since budget cuts, maybe four at the most.
My guess would be they're either dead or paralyzed by now.
This might just be the confluence of events we've been hoping for.
Confluence or conflagration?
I'm open to both.
Make the decision from a vantage point of strategy over emotion, and we'll follow your lead.
What about Scott?
Scott's not the one who forced my mother to kill herself.
He's not exactly an innocent bystander either.
You can't pick and choose...
If they try and protect him, then we kill them.
All right, so what do we do?
Do we just... do we just sit here and wait to die?
Wha... oh, what are you doing?
Aw, gross.
There.
You know, I-I feel sorry for you, McCall, 'cause right now, you're thinkin', "how am I gonna explain this when it heals?"
Isthatwhathappenedtoyou?
You drowned, didn't you?
I didn't know they had just won state, and lahey, he's letting his favorites come over to have a couple drinks to celebrate.
Hehadthisfirstedition spider-man, or was it Batman?
What... the hunter?
Theythrewyouin.
I-IyelledthatIcan't swim, but nobody listens.
This,thisis yourfault!
You know about that little white light that they talk about, you see when you die?
Well, I didn't see anything.
Just darkness.
Iwastakingsomephotos.
And then, purely by accident, lahey gets in one of the photos.
And the next day, he actually was.
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Was...washe theguy who stabbed out his eyes?
God,that's oedipus, you dumbass!
If there was a crime that had gone unpunished, the furies would do the punishing.
Jackson is my fury.
You know, when I saw him the next night, it was like this bond had been cemented between the two of us.
I knew he had killed lahey for me, and I knew he would do it again.
Help,I 'm...soI took more pictures.
Soisthathypothetical situation we talked about getting any less hypothetical?
Dude, I can move my toes.
Shakespeare wrote that love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.
Let's give them some love.
If you're not going to tell me, then get out of my way.
You should've given me a chance.
'Cause remember how I said I'm not the kind of guy who would say something like, "well, if I can't ever, no one can."
It's not totally true because, Allison, if I can't have you, no one can!
My son has been shot, and I've heard other gunfire, and I don't know what's happening, but can you please just let me see my son?
Scott, you okay?
No!
Trust me, I'm aware of that.
I've done everything that you've asked of me.
I'm part of Derek's pack, I've given you all the information that you wanted, I told you Matt was controlling Jackson... and leave him to us.
Help your friends.
No longer afraid of the water?
You're gonna have to talk to your counselor tomorrow if you want to change those classes.
But I don't want to change them.
Yeah, I know, but in my humble opinion, five A.P. Classes is a bit much.
I'm pretty sure that's what college is for, dad.
It's no problem.
- Those are pretty.
I just want to get out of here.
I don't really know.
So what are these pictures?
It looks like we know each other pretty well.
She works at the clinic with me.
So you remember where you work?
All right, this was taken two years ago at Chris and Melissa's house.
We live together.
I don't know what to say.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired, actually.
I'll stop in later.
There once was a man who lived a life so strange, it had to be true.
And he's the one who must stop them.
There is the possibility of prosopagnosia, when a patient has trouble recognizing familiar faces.
Why can't I remember you?
Easy does it.
Sleep tight.
Nighty-night.
You said you were having trouble sleeping and some periods of anxiety?
Yeah.
I was on a murder case.
Witnesses were having trouble remembering what they saw.
My partner and I secured a suspect at a theater.
It's what happened after that.
He... he changed.
What do you mean?
After... after he fell, after I shot him...
What are you remembering?
He changed.
II think we just need to go a little slower.
Well, there's a lot more to it than that.
All I'm saying is, odds are, if she doesn't know you, she's not gonna know me.
I know, but we were the last two people she saw before she went out.
That, actually, might not be such a good thing.
Oh, I forgot to bring her flowers too!
Nick, you know, just don't get your hopes up, that's all.
You and me.
I have been here.
How are they treating you?
I guess she's calmed down, you know?
Who are you?
Don't you remember, Carly?
Last time I saw you, you were finger painting on the side of my house and your mama got real mad.
Mm, not as mad as we got when you all took off.
Your daddy brought shame down on us when he took your mama and you away.
What are you gonna do to me?
We're gonna take you back into the pack.
It's good to see you again.
It was a hell of a fight.
We checked with her place of employment, but there was none.
Her house is paid for, so is her car.
Adalind Schade..
So do I.
You don't sound like it.
I put three bullet holes in my closet, Nick, and there wasn't anything there.
Hey, look...
Now, I know a lot of weird stuff has been going on lately, but...
You and I need to talk, you know, about some of these things that have been going on lately.
- Hank.
There's a guy here asking to see you.
Jarold Kampfer?
- Thanks.
Um, she was supposed to meet with her school counselor this morning and she didn't show up, and that's not like her at all.
When was the last time you saw her?
Uh, last night, before she went to sleep.
Uh, I left early this morning for work, so I didn't want to wake her up, so I didn't check on her.
And then I got the call at work from her counselor asking where she was, so I went home, checked in her room, and her cell phone was there.
She never leaves her cell phone at home.
What about her mom?
No, Lisa passed five years ago.
No, no, she's never been in any kind of trouble.
You know, uh, work, associates, anybody you might owe money to?
Now, let us check out a few things before we file a missing persons report.
I'm gonna need the names and numbers of anybody she could be with or anybody who might know where she is.
Okay.
The kind of guys you don't want to run into in a dark alley or a parking garage, under the bleachers.
Okay, we're talking street gangs of the wesen world?
Yeah, pretty much, I mean, minus the black leather jackets and the steel-toed boots.
You have any idea what that means?
Uh, well, Nick, when a mommy coyotl and a daddy coyotl love each other very much...
Typical coyotl.
I mean, it's all about breeding.
Or inbreeding, as the case usually is.
The female is taken by a member of the pack into the fertility matrix.
That's the stakes with the skulls, I'm guessing.
So are we talking about some kind of mating ritual?
According to this, that's how they introduce females to the pack.
No wonder Hank's buddy moved back to Portland.
The whole ceremony starts with ritual feasts, where coyotls slaughter dogs and other small animals.
Does it mention when after the 17th year this consummation is supposed to take place?
Under the full moon.
- Well, let me guess, that's...
Hey, don't you want to hear how it went with Juliette?
Well, does she remember me?
Yeah, but I've gotta find this girl.
Okay, thanks for talking to Juliette.
I'm gonna call you.
Oh, man.
I don't know, Hank, these are all her friends.
None of these people have it in for her, and I've talked to most of them already.
Look, I'm gonna tell you something, and you're probably gonna get all upset, but I want you to know, I am on your side.
What are you talking about?
No, and that has not been easy to deal with.
Yeah, I know.
Could there be a coyotl connection to your daughter's disappearance?
I know it is a barbaric ritual we don't want any part of, but that's Lisa's family, and they live back in Texas...
Uh, accused me of breaking up the family, and things got pretty heated, which is why I left the way I did, but I haven't spoken to them in over ten years.
I know you never liked them, man, but in all these years, you never talked about them like they were crazy enough to do something like this.
Yeah, well, there are some things about your family you don't even tell your closest friends.
All right, give me a name.
Hayden.
No, they treated her like she never even existed.
Even got himself a record.
Four traffic tickets in two months.
One disorderly conduct.
Yeah, that sounds like Hayden.
I know where he's working.
See anyone you recognize?
Stay in the car.
I don't know about the tattoo.
What can I do for you two gentlemen?
Right.
Where is he?
Hayden's not here, but we do have his address.
- You smell that?
- Yeah.
You all right?
No, I'm not all right, and neither is the son of a bitch that lives here.
Hey, Nick, I think I got something here.
Time to wash up.
Want you nice and clean for the ceremony.
We found a deed of foreclosure for a place called renniker farm out on sawmill road.
That's not a good idea.
All right, but you stay in the car until we figure out what the hell is going on.
Put it on.
I remember when your mother went through this too.
Please, don't do this.
Oh, man, it looks like we got trouble.
What?
Some cops came by the shop looking for you.
We have to finish this.
We will.
So what else did you find in Hayden's apartment?
Nothing.
Okay, look, there were some dead animals in there.
Now, Jarold, whatever this guy's into, it's not good.
No, it's not good, Hank.
We're here.
Don't worry.
Play it cool.
Okay, that's him.
Have I done something I don't know about?
No, we just want to ask you some questions.
Turn down the music, Todd.
What can I do you for?
Happy to help you any way I can.
What's the problem?
We're looking for a missing girl.
Your niece, Carly Kampfer.
Carly's missing?
Well, that's terrible.
I haven't seen her in years.
It's sad to say, but we don't have much contact with that side of the family.
You came all the way out here from Texas, and you didn't bother to reach out to them?
It's a shame you drug yourselves all the way out here for nothing.
Oh, my God.
Carly!
Jarold!
Get the guns.
Quit your firing.
He's gonna kill me!
You ain't going nowhere.
He's the reason why the cops are here.
Let's kill him now.
Time to show 'em what we're really made of.
Just like I saw brinkerhoff and the wildemann and others that you haven't seen.
I know what you've been going through, and I know what you've seen, and I've seen a lot more of it for a lot longer.
Why?
He's lying.
You good with that?
What's he trying to pull?
He thinks he's got an advantage because of what he is, but he doesn't know what I am.
So we're gonna let him in.
Oh, I'm ready.
You fellas, you have no idea what you're dealing with.
Let me show you why.
It's time for you to scream.
Let's go.
They got in through the window.
And about what time was that?
I think about 8:45.
You all right, Hank?
Well, you don't have to put everything down, do you?
I would have told you the truth if I could have.
Nothing's changed, okay?
Yeah, we've all put in a rich, full day.
It's the hospital.
You can pick her up this evening.
Well, Juliette, this must be really weird for you.
Like, I'm a stranger in your house.
But, to me, this our house.
Did that window break?
How did that happen?
Good night, Nick.
Oliver Queen is alive.
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish-- to use the list of names he left me to bring down those who are poisoning my city.
To do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Was I supposed to have lunch with her today?
She said she left you like 5 messages.
Just bite the bullet and have a Cobb salad with the woman.
Get down!
No, I'm--I'm-- are you sure?
Call 9-1-1!
I'm fine.
As I was telling your mother and sister, the CAT-Scan showed a grade two concussion.
She can go home so long as someone stays with her just to make sure there are no after effects.
Thank you.
What did you think you were doing anyway?
Yeah, I wanted to get the license plate of the guy who took a shot at you.
That's cute.
I wasn't trying to be.
You don't believe me?
But it's getting hard when you won't be truthful with us.
Well, you know your family's at the tippy-toppy of the my list of priorities, but the guy that she was with was connected, mobbed up to the eyeballs connected.
Keep the change.
So, Tommy, what brings you by so late?
Well, I assumed, rightly, that you would be at home working tonight, and I also assumed that you might be hungry.
That is damn good pie.
All right, what do you have to offer?
Uh, actually, there was something that I wanted to ask you.
And what's that?
You brought me dinner to ask me to dinner?
Well, I also did throw you a really big charity gala.
See, I thought you threw it for the hundreds of people it would benefit.
You know, first we're friends for many years, and then briefly we are friends with benefits, extremely excellent benefits.
And now I am just hoping that we can be two people sitting at the same restaurant at the same table at the same time.
See, when I see it like that, it doesn't sound so scary, does it?
Copani works for Bertinelli Construction and Frank Bertinelli.
The mob boss?
Bertinelli has a lot of enemies.
The best way to figure out who's trying to target his organization is to get inside of it.
So let me get this right, Oliver.
Your mother's shot at, nearly killed, and the way you process this emotionally is by going undercover with the mob.
I'm not trying to process anything emotionally.
Yeah, well, maybe that's your problem, man.
You ever thought about just being there for your family?
I tried that today with Thea.
She told me I wasn't being honest with her, and she's right.
I can't very well explain to her that I left our mother alone and bleeding on the pavement because I'm fast enough to almost run down the attacker.
But what I can do is protect my family.
And, Diggle, when I found out who this guy is, he's a dead man.
I have to go out tonight.
I thought you'd be watching mom.
I spent the whole day with her.
I thought you were taking the night shift.
I'm sorry, but this thing, it's important.
You know, sometimes, Ollie, I just don't get you.
And by sometimes, I mean ever.
You're actually not the first person to say that to me today.
Why am I not surprised?
Apparently.
Long story.
Mainly because I don't want you to find this out from someone else, that someone else especially being Laurel.
That's...that's good.
Laurel deserves someone special, and so do you.
Thanks, man.
Oh, and, Tommy, if you hurt her, I'll snap your neck.
I'm just kidding.
Mr. Bertinelli.
Thank you for agreeing to meet me at my home.
My father used to say that living rooms make the best conference rooms.
So what are you in the mood for?
We could watch reality housewife cooking show or cop docs.
It's where doctors run around fighting crime when they're not all sleeping with each other.
Oh, it's not like there's anybody else who could be staying with you.
Oh, wait, yes, there is.
Don't be too harsh on your brother.
Thea, everyone has secrets.
We all have things that we want to keep to ourselves.
I just don't get him sometimes.
I know.
I know.
You know, being in that hospital and seeing Dr. Lamb again, it made me remember the day that Oliver came home.
It was Dr. Lamb that told me that the Oliver we'd lost might not be the Oliver that they'd found.
I think it's easy to forget, but he lived apart from civilization for 5 years.
It was my impression from the local news that you weren't going to be involved with your family's business.
Well, apparently there were a few catch phrases that I missed while I was away for 5 years.
And I am inclined to give it to you.
Your mother wasn't quite so enthusiastic.
How is she, by the way?
And, Frank, I was very sorry to hear about what happened to Paul Copani.
Paul was a good friend.
He was a good man.
I've had the same thought.
So why did you come back?
After that island, you could have settled anywhere in the world.
Because starling city is my home.
No matter which way you go or turn, you always end up at home.
I can take care of myself.
I wasn't asking, sweetie.
Now.
Just excuse us for a moment, would you?
Oliver Queen.
I look forward to working together.
Thank you for coming.
Anything for a friend.
We're not responsible for the attacks on your people.
What does the Triad have to gain by provoking you now?
Well, no one ever credited the Triad with rational thinking?
If not them, then who?
Whoever it is, when I find out who's behind this, there will be blood.
Sounds like Bertinelli's ready to put the screws to everyone who pays him protection money.
Whoever is pruning the family tree is using bullets instead of arrows.
So you do think it's one of the other families.
No.
Then who?
You are an angel, Helena.
Of course, Mr. Russo.
I'm glad.
So, why would you want to go into business with my father?
You know who he is and how he made his money.
You don't approve of your family's enterprises?
We share a name, and that name defines us whether we want it to or not.
You've already made judgments about me, just like I've already made judgments about you.
Sorry.
That's okay.
I know it must have been hell for you, alone on that island for 5 years, but I'm...
But what?
No pressure from your family, no need to be the person everyone else expects you to be.
Was there ever a day when-- when I didn't feel lost and I felt...free?
Well, thank you for letting me choose Indian.
You know, I read this article by a film critic once, who said if he could have one wish, it would be to watch his favorite movie again for the first time.
I kind of wish that was us.
I wish we had just met and that all this was just beginning and there wasn't so much of me I wish you'd forget.
Well, keep saying nice things like that and maybe next time I'll let you choose the restaurant.
Did you swipe it a few times?
You know, sometimes those things can be a little glitchy.
I did, and, um, I'm afraid the credit card company wants me to confiscate it.
People are always asking me, what did I miss the most?
Why can't you just be truthful?
I don't know how truthful I can be.
Anymore.
He died.
It's nice to be with someone who knows how hard it can be.
My father would kill me if I let you pay.
I have a confession.
I didn't want to go out with you tonight.
That makes two of us.
I'm really glad that I did.
Thea, you don't need to knock, sweetheart.
What about me?
I hope you don't mind.
Thea let me in.
Well, surely someone of your means has a telephone.
I like to see someone when I have something important to talk about.
You are a vital part of Starling City's future.
It's been my experience that when someone has a brush with death like you experienced today, even their deepest held convictions can change.
Have they?
No.
What happened?
Yeah, well, he's been paying visits to everyone who owes the mob protection money.
Diggle, I'm trying to figure out who took a shot at my mother, not take on all of organized crime.
Well, listen, Oliver, Salvati and his goons have already put 4 people in the hospital tonight, and if somebody doesn't stop them, the poor bastard who owns Russo's is gonna be next.
I was having dinner with Bertinelli's daughter.
Oliver, you're supposed to be going undercover, not speed dating.
I didn't have a choice.
Salvati's here.
I'm sorry, we're closed.
Oh, Mr. Salvati.
I have some fresh-made lasagna.
I already made my payment this month.
You need to pay again.
Going to what?
Restock your bar?
Break his fingers.
Leave him alone!
Break hers, too.
It's not a joke, Diggle.
Oliver, you're not falling for this girl, are you?
Because I know you can't be that crazy.
She has to have reasons for what she's doing.
Reasons?
Any attempt on his right hand is gonna send your new friend's father on the warpath.
I know what I'm doing.
Now I know how your family feels when you lie to them.
Is this the only angle you got?
The Russos chintzed out a bit on their security package.
Somebody is in the wings with a gun shooting at these guys.
A business dinner, a birthday dinner, a couple of blind dates.
Son of a bitch.
Your, um, your buddy with the arrows was at Russo's last night.
Why the sudden concern for my well-being?
And you felt like you owed me one?
If I did, as far as I'm concerned, this clears the books.
I pay Sandy a king's ransom each year in fees, Tommy.
When it comes to money, if he says it's so, it's so.
The better question is, why not sooner?
Helena.
How did you find me here?
I followed you from your house.
Your fiance?
Yeah.
Oliver... you should stay away from me.
Helena?
Get in.
My father is going to kill you for this.
I've been wanting to do that for years.
You dropped this at Russo's.
You're smarter than I gave you credit for, Nicky.
Then what the hell is it about?
My father had Michael murdered.
Of course he did.
Everything that could send your father and me to prison for the rest of our lives was on it.
That computer-- was mine.
Michael wasn't the one talking to the FBI.
Well, then it's your fault Michael's dead.
Not your father for ordering the hit or me for carrying it out.
Yours.
You shot Michael.
In the chest, so he knew it was me.
Helena...
I didn't have a choice, Oliver.
No one can know my secret.
CSU didn't find any usable prints except for the 3 victims.
You okay?
I spoke to my dad today.
You are gonna be fine, Tommy.
In fact, you are gonna be great.
I suppose it's already paid for, right?
I'm so happy to see you.
Is she all right?
Walter's home.
Clearly you have yours.
And it's fine if you don't want to share them with us, but I just really think you should share them with someone.
I'd ask how you got in here, but the Starling City vigilante comes and goes as he pleases, doesn't he?
How'd you know?
I saw you fight.
And I saw your eyes.
That island changed you in ways that only someone like me could understand.
It's revenge.
Sometimes revenge is justice.
Your father killed your fiance.
And what did your father do to you?
Isn't the man in the hood fighting to set things right?
No, we're not.
Hiding in plain sight.
Concealing our anger with smiles and lies.
Why are you crying?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because I have been alone in my hate for so long.
Now that's what I call going for a spin!
Now that's what I call a snappy retort!
Stop saying what you call things!
I'm trying to watch the movie!
But are you sure we will not be bothered by the American master-spy Stradivarius Cain?
Do not worry about Doctor Cain.
The last I saw him, my beautiful mistress was about to finish him off.
Yes, that's what I did.
You killed him, right?
Yes, he was the perfect lover... of being killed!
It's a weird sentence, but let's move on.
My baker has prepared an edible monument to Cain's demise.
Party's over, General.
He turned that Russian guy into Swiss cheese!
Hey, Homer, great yell-outs tonight!
You've ruined me for other men!
That's my hobby.
This is my job.
Looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!
I couldn't have thought of that in 10,000 lifetimes!
Swiss cheese...
Marge, how come you're not saying anything?
There was enough talking during the movie.
This date night was even worse than the date night we saw Date Night.
Oh man, Marge is pissed.
Just take me home!
That's what she said!
In order to cut down on the rash of embarrassing YouTube videos of our teachers, we will be scanning you and taking away your smartphones.
Make sure I get this back.
A new low.
I should've taken that superintendent job in Honduras.
My mom says bullies only bully 'cause they're scared.
Your mom's next!
And I know eye-ease!
Honey, it's me again.
I can't work knowing that you're mad at me.
I just wanna hear your voice.
Left for left, right for right!
Enough of your double-talk!
Smithers, give this man one Ibuprofen, uncoated, and send him back to his workstation.
Sir, Simpson has sustained a serious concussion.
Recent research says you must give him time off to recover.
Oh, that's right.
That's a good thing.
But you said it so mean.
Eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin.
Hey, Marge, here's something that'll make you happy!
Not in the mood!
Now, listen, Lisa...
Got what, Homer?
Homer, I'm a single mother trying to raise a family here.
You know... maybe I should call in sick.
We could visit all our old romantic haunts that have closed and turned into temporary Halloween stores.
I have to take Maggie for her checkup.
And a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.
Just for that, you can go to the principal's office, while the rest of the class enjoys... a movie day.
But for 30 days, this reporter ate nothing but this joker's deck of carbs.
And I say:
Do you want lies with that?
What is it this time?
That the town I sponsor in Africa doesn't exist?
As for my cholesterol...
It's bad.
You can just scrape it right off.
But still I soldier on with my "Laffy Meal."
Hey, this is all above-board.
One month of eating Krustyburger and nothing else has transformed me into a morbidly obese, toilet-busting American.
If I don't have some kind of nugget every five minutes, I'll die.
But it'll be worth it if my suffering teaches Krusty the value of proper nutrition.
Well, why can't I hang out at the bar all day?
My wife doesn't want to be with me.
Look, I'd love to discuss your problems, but a pack of raccoons took over my back room and today's the day I make my stand.
I wish I could pull down my zipper and that guy would come out.
Stranger things have happened, Homer.
Am I losing my marbles?
No, I'm just an illusion caused by the concussion you suffered at the plant.
Can I put my hand through you?
If you want.
C'mon... really?
Show a little class.
Sorry.
Now I'm about to undertake my toughest mission ever:
to make you into a man your wife can't resist.
Other people's imaginary friends can see me.
Hello, Dr. Cain.
Hello, Hufnpuffalus.
Sorry I slept with your girlfriend.
You did me a favor, man.
Lunch money, lunch money, lunch money.
Simpson, you know why I'm here.
Nelson, I could give you my lunch money... or I could give you...
I didn't know they served these things warm!
Aw... they feel like a baby's head.
I just thank God you didn't take my coupons.
Got enough for a month.
I knew that.
I must say, whoever installed your car's secret weapons did a great job hiding them.
Yeah, Dr. Cain, the thing about that is... uh, there aren't any weapons.
Sounds like you're turning into wife number two.
I can do that.
So, stick with Marge!
Whoa, what's going on there, Lou?
Well, if you ask me, Chief...
All right, what does this mean?
Childhood obesity... it's not funny anymore!
No, you're imagining things.
What else you got?
Just bubbling oil.
Stand back and give me a straw.
Now, the ultimate test:
But I'm a married man.
'Cause your hair looks really messed up.
Okay, it matters a little what you say.
Moving on...
How many hardboiled eggs do you think I can eat?
Look, just say this:
But that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes.
I leave for two seconds to get chocolate martinis, and my wife is expertly seduced by this pork empanada!
What do I do?
Squirt that lemon in his eye!
Did you see the guy?
Marge, what brings you to the S.N.P.P.?
Here, right?
Not since Burns gave him that time off.
Oh, I can't believe this!
What'd you say to her?
I don't know.
Because he's been eating nothing but your food!
Atta boy!
Not my responsibility.
He didn't have to order that crap.
We've got yogurt and salad on the menu!
Do you actually serve those items?
Billy, get this kid into superhero shape!
Hugh Jackman Wolverine?
I'm not made of money.
Alicia Silverstone Batgirl?
He's that now.
Busy day at work?
Did you get a lot of work done, workerman?
You're right, Marge, I lied.
And I spent all that time learning how to be a better husband.
This car's so clean!
I'm not getting flea bites on my ankles!
Looking for this?
Why is he trying to kill you, and why did she call you her love?
It was all a training exercise to make me smooth for you.
Of course, she fell for me, and of course, I wanted no part of her.
Now the only one who can help us is Stradivarius Cain.
The guy from the movie?
I'll explain later.
Strad, come back!
I know you're in there!
Not you.
Big fan, but no.
Cleatus the football robot, you're my only hope!
No one likes you!
How can a fat man hide so well?
Strad, where are you?
You can handle him, Homer.
Just remember what I taught you.
When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky.
But that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes.
I cannot kill a poet like you.
And you are a very lucky woman.
This is why I always say "mingle at parties."
Can't friends talk about friends?
He is not your friend!
Then why did he say he'd call me when he comes to Bolivia?
So, how many more weeks do you have off?
Actually, I was supposed to be back last week.
We'll just wait for the call from Human Resources.
I guess my work here is done.
But Stradivarius Cain will return in "Lisa Gets a B Plus."
I knew you were mad at me.
At the risk of inflaming Sister Fate, this bully-free period has been an Arcadian idyll!
This is a happy ending?
Well, he's tough on nerds, but easy on the eyes.
What'd you just say?
Let me remind you, brother... any more interference by you will not be tolerated.
The person who wakes her has to be pure of heart.
Tell me about this prince.
Well, he's handsome, charming, and a bastard, and I mean that literally.
- Did Nick kill my mother?
- Why don't you come back here so we can talk all this out?
Juliette's awake, you know.
Sometimes, on a night like tonight, you used to, um, dance.
What's wrong?
Me.
Papua New Guinea.
Correct.
The Bulgarian Leu.
- That is correct.
Um, but I need a little bit of help.
It's a little stuck. -
Hey, thanks for coming to this thing with me.
They do to each other's boring work functions.
We better get going.
You're all doing great.
- Except for Kevin.
- Yeah, I'm in.
You've still got math homework tonight.
Come on, please?
We won't keep him out that late, Dr. Higgins.
I think any one of them could go all the way.
That's hot.
- Franken-dude, you have a nobel-prize-winning mom.
I mean, you were born with answers, like, pre-loaded into your cranium.
It's from the genetics society.
The trans fats will wreak frickin' havoc with your synaptic abilities.
Whatever.
I'll race you, loser.
- Nah, I'm gonna hoof it.
No!
I'm honored by this award and for the recognition that it bestows.
The landmark organization has been a beacon of hope and opportunity for so many in our community.
But for me, the highest honor is serving with the men and women of the Portland police bureau, whose bravery and commitment and dedication to law and order is a constant source of inspiration.
- Yeah, that's why I'm buying.
Uh, he bought us one too.
I think I should buy you another drink, sir.
No, I could always take you home, if you don't mind waiting.
If that's not too much trouble.
- What do we got?
Still got his wallet.
Probably went out that way.
Where's Brandon?
Uh, good night.
Good night.
- What kind of idiot are you?
When was the last time you saw Brandon?
We were all at Zell's last night.
What time did you go to Zell's?
Right after we finished practice, about 8:30.
Not exactly what?
Well, whoever wins the finals here gets to represent the school in Salem.
After that, it's the nationals.
How'd you get to the cafe from school?
Uh, Jenny drove us.
And how long did you stay?
Um, about an hour and a half.
I would have given them all a ride home, but they wanted to walk.
Did Brandon have any trouble at school?
Why did you call Brandon last night?
Do you have any idea who might have done this?
We're just beginning the investigation, ma'am.
I don't think so, but I don't know what I don't know.
Sir, you do realize you're speaking to the police.
I don't give a damn who I'm talking to, you understand?
I have known that kid since he was in the first grade!
We just need to know where we can contact you.
So was he a...?
One speeding violation six months ago and a restraining order issued three years ago by his ex... no reported violation.
Maybe we should get a search warrant for his apartment.
Anker's a teacher in the public school system, and one of his students has been brutally murdered.
We need to be careful.
If we're wrong about him, we could destroy his career.
He has no alibi for last night.
We have no hard evidence to move on.
If we move too soon, we could tip him off.
Right now it's the only motive we have.
Otherwise it's just a random act.
Just stay on top of it.
This one's gonna get a lot of attention.
Someday I hope to, well, you know, do what you guys do.
Okay, that's enough brown-nosing, there's a lot more people to meet... save some for them.
The 40-year-old is quite remarkable, but I wouldn't have thought you a lomharach man.
No?
What kind of man do you think me to be?
Well, I suddenly seem to be remembering things we haven't done yet.
Is that possible?
You like sunsets, long walks on the beach, and doing whatever it takes to restore your family to the power it once knew, even if that means torture, murder, or worse.
Right you are.
Well, for one thing, I know your brother, Sean.
The circumstances of our discord were quite grim.
That sounds almost as tragic as Wagner.
You really have no idea.
Would you like a shoulder to cry on?
Two.
Then let's start with an arm.
Gyokuro differs from the standard sencha in being grown under shade.
If this is the same green tea she got the last time, we're good.
Can I help you?
'Cause we can deal with both.
A person.
Right, and how long have you had these feelings?
I'm actually kind of there now, as a matter of fact, but, yeah, we're not here to talk about me.
- Do I know you?
This sounds like it could be the result of a kind of potion-y, dark arts-related, maleficium type of situation.
Is that possible?
If you just want to leave your name and... you know, why don't you just get it?
Hey, how's it going?
I keep trying to figure out this equation, but it's, like, coming up jumbled numbers.
You're doing homework?
My mom wanted me to study before piano lessons.
She says it's gonna get my mind off things, but I-I don't know.
I still can't believe it.
I should've made him get in my car.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Well, it feels like it is.
It's just too sad.
Do you want to meet me?
Okay, thanks.
Pierce?
Is that you?
Okay, whoever's in there, this is majorly unfunny.
This way, guys.
She's friends with the kid who was killed last night.
Oh, man, this just really got ugly.
- Pierce Higgins, yeah.
- That kid could do this?
- If he's a Lowen, he could.
- All right, how do we find out?
We push him.
- Anyone here with you?
Hey, what time is it, Pierce?
Wellum, I'm not wearing my watch.
You know where it is?
It's probably upstairs in my room.
No, I don't think so.
- What?
Have you been with Pierce all day?
My God, no.
When was the last time you saw her?
Why are you questioning him like this?
You leave my son alone.
Don't you dare hurt him.
I'm not here to hurt you or Pierce.
I swear, we're just trying to help.
Jenny had your son's watch.
Well, then somebody gave it to her.
He couldn't hurt anybody.
Are you going to arrest him for something he couldn't do?
No, we're not gonna arrest anyone right now.
What the hell just happened?
Well, he's not a Lowen, and neither is she.
- What are they?
I don't know.
I love you.
What are you doing in here?
Hello?
Dr. Higgins, it's me.
Under the circumstances, I don't see how we can continue.
I'm sorry you don't agree with me, but my decision is final.
Can I talk to Pierce?
Coach Anker is going to withdraw the school from the academic decathlon.
No, he can't do that.
You can't let him.
So, if Pierce is incapable of killing, how'd his watch get there?
Well, maybe somebody planted it there.
Maybe he gave it to Jenny before.
Maybe he had someone working with him.
- Who happens to be a Lowen.
We got two dead kids.
Seems like someone's helping to eliminate Pierce's competition.
Pierce is the one to beat.
This doesn't make a lot of sense, but let's go give coach Anker a visit, see what kind of alibi he's got this time.
Mr. Anker, Portland P.D. Open up.
We've got a problem.
Mr. Anker?
This just happened.
Yeah, but he was the Lowen.
How'd you know my brother?
He was a friend of my mother's.
How well did she know him?
She got to know him better than she should have.
As did you?
Do you know how he ended up in Portland?
Never really shared much of his past.
He was always more interested in his future.
Yes, I'm sure he has an interesting wish list.
So do I.
Don't we all?
Would you like to know how my half brother ended up in the farther reaches of the Louisiana purchase?
I always wondered how a royal ended up in Portland.
Half royal, technically.
Well, not so long ago, when I was a young boy awaiting the throne, it was discovered that one of my father's mistresses was a Hexenbiest.
You can understand how my own mother wasn't keen on having a Hexenbiest in the family, not that I share such prejudices.
Well, what do you say we put all our clothes on the floor, so to speak?
You didn't come all the way to vienna just to listen to the zither.
I happen to like the zither.
No, just your brother and the Grimm.
- So you've met this Grimm?
- Where are you?
I'm so sorry.
I don't want to talk to you.
These are mine.
They're mine.
I didn't want anyone to hurt you.
What's happening to me?
I always knew you would be smart, but that's not enough anymore.
- What's happening to me?
Please, you've got to believe me.
Pierce, don't!
I'll take the back.
So it was Pierce?
- S-s-so he's a Lowen?
How?
So you... you made him a Lowen?
When the Lowen presents, he doesn't even know it's happening.
An ambulance is on its way.
We got a suspect on foot...
Pierce Higgins, 18-year-old Caucasian in willamette heights.
Consider him dangerous.
Nick, mobile unit checked in, they have a 20 on Pierce.
He's at the water tower near Montgomery park.
Meet you there.
Pierce!
Please don't come any closer!
No, you didn't!
You didn't even know it was happening.
Stay back!
How is killing Pierce's friends "looking out for him"?
Because he needs to be the best.
I made sure that he did.
Pierce, just listen to me.
There's no answer for this.
I keep thinking and thinking and trying to come up with an answer, but there isn't one.
D.A. is gonna charge Pierce Higgins with three counts of homicide.
You able to establish a motive?
Well, his mother, Dr. Higgins, claimed to have attempted to modify his genetics in utero.
My guess is that has something to do with the psychosis.
Psychiatrists are gonna have a field day with this one.
Too bad his life started going down the wrong road before he was even born.
That's the story with most of the people we put away.
That poor kid... he's gonna have a tough time in prison.
You're in my spot, bitch.
Now you're in my spot.
Did I say you could look at me?
I'm not crying.
It's time we show you who's king of this jungle.
Yeah, I guess it is.
- What the hell?
There is a treatment that can help lessen the physical... it's sort of a damper, like a flame retardant, sort of a reverse Viagra, if you will.
The emotional component is much more complicated, and without knowing more about you and the person you're in love with, it's nearly impossible to diagnose.
Well, love so often is.
Are you sure there's really no way to track down the object of your affliction?
I'm just telling you, man, apparently, this could get really gnarly, and not just for you, but for anyone standing between you and the person you're hung up on.
So going with the flow is really not a healthy game plan.
Okay, people, we are trying to depict the sizzling final days of the Nathan Lane of the New Testament, Jesus Christ.
Yeah, okay, point stage left.
I prepared right!
Well, I better get going.
This is starting to feel a little churchy.
Why do we have to audition for the stupid play, and Dad gets to leave?
I already have my part.
Man Who Buys Ticket, But Doesn't Show Up.
Also, the Passion Play isn't stupid.
It's the greatest story ever told.
Maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories.
Krusty vs. the F.D.A.
Game Six of the 2011 World Series.
Yeah, why aren't we doing Lenny's story?
That thing's hilarious.
That's what you get for having a monkey give you a foot massage.
My bucket list is my business.
Next audition!
You will be a non-speaking Pharisee.
Just like me on Twitter!
Our Lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool.
And although I personally follow the enlightened teachings of Lord Buddha, messing with Jesus really gets people mad.
It's like wearing a Florida State jersey to a Florida game.
O Lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders?
It'll be fine.
Why do I succeed at everything I audition for?
Dear Lord, I know you see all, but trust me, You do not want to see this.
And so our Lord was brought before Pontius Pilate.
Do you call yourself King of the Jews?
He's good.
Wow, I'm so moved I renounce science, with the facts, and the peer reviews, and the hypotheses tested by evidence.
What shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ?
Crucify him!
Crucify him!
Weep not for me, but weep for yourselves.
Looks like someone didn't follow the underwear rule!
This man is totally the Son of God.
Tonight you shall be at my right hand in heaven.
Lord, forgive me for my pride.
All wise as always, you have rightly raised Homer above me.
Never again will I question...
I'm not licked.
Sorry, ma'am, only members of the immediate family allowed in.
Ned and Edna, married?
Well, it was nice having a secret marriage while it lasted.
No, but I'm sure Newt Gingrich wouldn't steer us wrong.
At least in the hospital we can just enjoy a nice, quiet moment together.
Congratulations, you two!
We're so, so happy for you.
Welcome to marriage.
Let's put it to a vote, America.
Enough with the voting.
Ned, Edna, why didn't you tell us?
'Cause everyone in this town makes such a big heckabaloo out of everything.
Nedding bells are ringing.
See what happens when Teachy met Preachy on Channel 6, your source for news-based puns.
I was just down the hall getting some very bad news, and I saw there was a party going on.
Hope you're both happy.
My Dearest, let me be the first to offer you the hearty handshake that would've climaxed our own wedding day...
Seymour, did you use my wig glue to patch your shoes again?
I tied them together with used dental floss, as per your memo!
O Lord, please bless our blended family.
And thank you for "cigarette mommy."
Oh, honey, please don't call me that.
Okay, "do-over mommy."
Boys, you will please call your new mother whatever she feels comfortable with.
How about "Edna?"
It's disrespectful to call a grown-up by their first name.
Get your hands off of me, you fat ass!
Homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?
Look at those squares, makin' it nice and legal.
We didn't need a piece of paper!
We had a paper, Nedward.
Great!
Dice are Satan's bones.
What the hey, Mrs. K?
Thank God, a real kid.
You want my advice on dealing with the Hardly Boys?
Skipping is cool!
Especially when you're holding hands with your brother.
If you don't act now, when they grow up, people like me are gonna take all their money and girlfriends.
This is my third-favorite wedding supply store.
"Extreme weddings.
It's extreme enough for me when they smear the wedding cake on each other's faces.
They have Itchy and Scratchy weddings?
The left-gifted bidextrous and transhanded community.
We're trying to decide on the theme for our Left is Right parade.
"Ourcissors, Ourselves."
How about, "Death to Righties"?
We have to live among them.
To live among them is to die.
Oh, this could go late.
We haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet.
Could you handle Rod and Todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
Sure, I'd love to be the parent for once.
Well, I must say at this school we've never seen a step-parent before.
Look, I'm a chalk jockey, too, so don't slap ketchup on bread and tell me it's Pizza Friday.
Well, we'll fit you into our school prayers.
You do have science here, right?
You pulled the boys out of school?
Ned, I know I should have consulted you, but that school is beneath them.
Oh, now aren't you glad you let Edna take charge of the boys' education?
It's okay, Daddy.
Give me your keys!
Maybe I'll just park it myself.
You really put on a great reception, Marge.
It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller.
Call me!
I'm married to the sea, and I'm seeing two of the Great Lakes on the side.
I won't say which ones, but it's eerie how superior they are.
So how do the boys like Springfield Elementary?
Marge, it's wonderful.
They're opening up, they've seen a wider world.
I wrote with a Flair pen.
Well, that's just great, boys.
Now come over here so Mrs. Simpson can take a photo.
Make sure our temporary tats are in the picture.
What if we were raptured right now?
Ned, I said it was okay.
Yeah, chillax, Daddy.
You get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy Rod sneakers that light up like Times Square.
You'd better decide whether you do.
Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for the Simpsons.
Mr. Syzslak, I have a feeling there's gonna be one more act to this story.
Bart, is there something you want to tell us?
Oh, Marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies.
That is totally irresponsible parenting.
I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
Why would you believe him?
Because his avatar is Darth Maul, the second-coolest Darth.
And what he says is true because it's in all caps.
I think he knows what he's talking about.
So after all this time together you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?
Don't tell me what our thing is!
It's about not agreeing on something.
I've always said hungry!
Bart, just tell us the problem.
I'm keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!
I thought I heard clicks and pops!
Children, your test scores are down because we've been having so many assemblies, you haven't had time to study.
This assembly will remedy that.
We've invited a few friends over to give you some musical cues.
I'm Sally Scantron Sheet.
And I'm Peter Pencil.
Now, you didn't hear it from us, but the answers to the test are... ♪ A, B, D, D, C, A, B... ♪
Pause the assembly!
I have to talk to my wife.
Some rivalry.
It's like Secretariat versus a can of dog food.
Edna, I'm sorry and I'll say it in front of God or groundskeeper Willie.
I guess I never really truly cared about children before.
Oh, get over it.
And Ned, I'll be exactly as much mom as you want me to be.
Hey, the Simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a Bible.
Welcome, money changers.
Fear and confusion led to panic.
The lucky ones made it out of the cities.
We still don't know why the power went out, but we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way.
Previously on Revolution...
Danny's gone.
You joined the rebels?
Trying to bring back the United States.
You want to turn the power back on, it starts with these pendants.
With my compliments, sir.
So now you have everything you need.
I told you, I'm a rebel from the St. Anne unit.
Okay, look, the only thing I know about you is you got a flag tattoo and you walked in the door with Miles Matheson.
Colonel and sergeant.
That's cute.
I mean, the Commanding General of the Monroe militia, walking in here?
Retired commanding general.
Tell me why I shouldn't execute you and all your friends right now.
Because I'm gonna hand you general Monroe's head on a plate.
And just why would you do that?
He's holding somebody prisoner in Philly.
It's my nephew, and there's only a handful of places they could be keeping him...
Every single one of them impossible to break into.
I can put you right in front of him, and you know I can.
Why should we believe you?
Let's just say, for a second, that I'm telling you the truth and that I can get you a clean shot at Monroe.
How do you pass that up?
What makes you so sure I know what I'm doing?
What makes you so sure I ever did?
What if Monroe is in our way?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
You got this?
Yeah, I think so.
This is the only way.
Lead the way, general.
I know the colonel wanted to kill me, and I know you talked him into this, so, thanks.
Indian Casinos, online poker.
I was a little sketchy, to tell you the truth.
But gambling teaches you to always play the odds.
Win-win.
What was he like?
I mean, he and Monroe, what were they like together?
Why would you ask that?
Miles said something about Monroe last night, and I just need to know.
If they were so close, the why'd Miles leave the militia?
Well... probably because he tried to assassinate Monroe.
That tends to drive a wedge between friends.
What happened?
Like I said, they were best friends.
Don't move.
It's a mine.
I never thought I'd hear music like that again.
What can I do for you, major?
I'd like to introduce you to Captain Burke.
I was hoping that you'd explain to him what this machine you're building does.
Major, I really don't have time to go through all of this again.
Captain.
Ma'am.
But for vehicles, weapons, you need a booster, an amplifier.
Flips on tanks, jets, missiles, as long as they're within range.
When will it be ready?
You mean, when will you have the ability to murder thousands of people?
Soon.
Militia must have put these in after I left.
It's all clear, ahead of this batch.
Now, get out of here before you blow yourselves up.
You guys too.
I'm not going anywhere.
Me neither.
Sometimes there's another mine underneath.
A trap under the trap...
So you're gonna step off, and if we don't get blown to bits, we're gonna run like hell, okay?
Good luck, everyone.
He left because he didn't want his kids to grow up scared in their own country.
How come you're fighting Monroe?
Stay next to me.
There's no one in there, Miles.
Well, he couldn't have just vanished into thin air.
- What bit your leg?
- The alligator!
It's fine.
My God, this makes sense.
You were hallucinating.
Why are we hallucinating?
It's because we're running out of air.
The torches are all burning low because they're not getting enough oxygen.
And I'm pretty sure that if we're suffocating, then hallucinations are the last things that are gonna happen before we die.
How far to this exit of yours, Matheson?
Aaron, are you seeing something?
No.
Damn it.
When?
What do we do now?
We gotta keep moving and find a way out.
Well, we gotta try.
You've gone to seed, my friend.
You look tired, brother.
So, was it worth it?
Leaving the militia?
Trying to kill me?
Why'd you do it, Miles?
You went too far.
No, you're wrong.
Miles, you're forgetting this is not real.
I know your dirty little secret, the one you don't want to tell Charlie or Nora.
What secret is that?
That if I take you back, you just might do it.
You just might sell out your friends.
You're scared, Miles.
You're scared it's going to happen.
No.
Just fell behind.
Let's go.
Yeah, I'm seeing things.
I'm also choking to death.
Look, I'm sorry.
Let's go.
I'm fine.
Why won't you talk to me?
Please, just look at me.
Why did you leave me?
But look at you.
You've been strong for Charlie.
On this whole trip, you've been strong.
So why couldn't you be that strong for me?
You broke my heart.
Nothing.
The torch is burning again.
It means there's got to be fresh air somewhere.
Look, that door.
It could be a service tunnel to the outside maybe.
Let me try.
We're getting out of here.
Some of us are.
You're militia.
That's right, general.
And I'm taking you home.
You don't remember me, do you?
I was so afraid you were going to make me.
Two years of deep cover down the drain.
The Trenton Campaign.
General Miles Matheson shook my hand.
It's how I report back to command.
But once I saw your pretty face, I knew Monroe would want you more than anything.
Figured it was worth blowing my cover for.
Dad?
Nice of you to join us, sleeping beauty.
What's wrong?
No, this isn't real.
I'm dreaming.
Militia killed you.
They took Danny and Maggie died.
Was I dreaming?
It felt so real.
It's all over.
You okay?
My head.
Just close your eyes, Charlie.
Just open your eyes.
Just close your eyes.
I am going to get Danny back.
I promise.
Come on, open them!
It's Uncle Miles.
You haven't seen him since you were a kid.
That's not true.
I went to Chicago.
You sent me there.
To get Miles so that I could get Danny back.
That's what's real.
I'm dreaming.
You need to rest.
I want to.
You have no idea how much I want to.
But I got to get Danny.
I love you, dad.
I want you to know how much I love you.
I think about you every day.
I'm sorry.
I have to.
You okay?
How's your head?
You've made me sit three hours already.
I've spent enough time down here, believe me.
You have any idea what's on the other side of that door?
Probably walking straight into a militia ambush.
Well, that will be par for the course, at least.
You ready to do this?
Are you?
Not really.
But what the hell?
Evening, Rachel.
Kind of busy here, Bass.
Right.
The machine.
The amplifier.
As you explained to Major Neville and Captain Burke.
Yes.
Then this machine, it, it amplifies the range of the pendant.
What's this about, Bass?
You know Major Neville is an invaluable member of my team.
His instincts, his little hunches about people.
They're almost never wrong.
He had a little hunch about what you're doing here, Rachel.
You remember Dr. Jaffe.
He's graciously agreed to work with us.
Dr. Jaffe.
Could you please take a look at this machine and tell us what it can do?
It's an amplifier.
I'm sorry, Rachel, but I know what I'm looking at.
Pretty sophisticated time bomb.
The pendant acts like an electric trigger.
I'd imagine she'd set it to go off when you were here but she wasn't.
No.
What'd you think was going to happen, Rachel?
You were going to escape with Danny in the chaos?
We had a deal and I kept my end of the bargain but now, it's over.
And Danny is dead.
You need me.
I have Dr. Jaffe.
I have his pendant.
I don't need you anymore.
Get her out of here.
I'm sorry.
Now you need me.
Zombie Cristina Barcelona.
I love you, and so does my bunny."
This is why I don't tell girls what I do.
Guys who aren't getting laid on the reg.
You're... you're scared to end it.
The guy who'd been in a coma who woke up thinking he had invented pie.
Oh, I got a great new idea for a dessert!
Wait a second, what year is it?
No, I didn't have moves, Amelia.
Didn't you think it was weird that I kept showing up at your door, telling you I had a family tragedy?
How many grandparents did you think I had?
I had a bad bag of moves, lady.
Yeah, it finally happened.
Well, I don't really do, uh, the, you know, sort of costume thing.
If he shows up wearing a costume, he likes me.
Butch it up, Axel Foley.
I'm reigning cats and dogs!
Get it?
Get off my horse, Schmidt.
Yeah, Robby, we all were.
You walk in all confident, and then once you get in, it's not what you thought it was gonna be, and it's scary.
Go in the "haunted house."
I don't get it.
I don't get it, either.
Look, let's just cut the crap, okay?
I know you think I'm dumb, and you can hit on Cece and make fun of me all day long, but I'm not going anywhere, all right?
It's okay to be vulnerable.
You guys are right.
And you're coming over tonight, hmm?
Lincoln, bringing the nation back together again.
It's just a recording.
Why do you have a mustache glued on top of your mustache.
Why aren't we having sex?
Somebody help me!
So... will you go out with me?
I told you... what I wanted, and I wasn't lying.
Do you want me to go?
And it's because you could not tell me how you felt.
So you always knew I liked you?
You drove me home every Thanksgiving break.
How do you feel about me now?
And what's up with the way you kiss?
It's... that's, like, the most important part.
I mean, his thighs are, like, the size of my head.
You know, I may not actually be Abraham Lincoln, but I witnessed the emancipation of one black guy tonight... from a terrible relationship.
I know I said you shouldn't put yourself out there, but I'm glad you did.
You should be with somebody who's crazy about you, Jess.
Sorry about that.
- And mine.
For centuries, supernatural creatures have lived among us.
They were vampires, werewolves, doppelgangers...
This would be so much more fun if we were naked.
That was your call, not mine.
I was being a gentleman.
So do it.
So, what do you want to do?
I want to throw you back in my bed and never let you leave.
So do it.
Saved by the cell phone.
Want to come?
Looks like a giant snowflake.
I prefer to think of it as an expression of post-modernism.
It's my donation to the winter wonderland charity event.
You want me to be a delivery guy?
What I want is for you to do whatever I say, without the attitude.
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, you know.
What is the point of my hybrids being sired to me if I can't maximize on the benefits of free labor?
What are you doing here?
Elena is sired to Damon.
I intuited as much.
Which means I need to find the cure now more than ever, and here you are making post-modern snowflakes.
You're the one who's supposed to deliver the hunter and his mark.
Well, Jeremy is the hunter, and he has to keep killing vampires to complete his mark, but we can't quite figure out how to keep him from killing us.
Sounds like quite the chore, which is why I feel perfectly justified in doing a little charity work.
Or maybe you're lying about having found the sword.
Why would I lie to you, Stefan?
We're in this together.
The hilt acts as a cypher which we'll use to decode the marks on Jeremy's tattoo when he's killed enough vampires to complete it.
I heard you moved out of your house.
Bit of a martyr move, hmm?
I'm not here to bond, Klaus.
I'm sick of taking his crap.
I should rip his throat off, see if he can boss us around without a larynx.
I found the witch that's gonna save your lives.
Are you serious?
We promised you guys we'd free you from Klaus.
You're going to do what?
So you're going to put him in someone else's body, and then what?
We'll encase the body in concrete, then bury it.
Why not just desiccate him like Bonnie did?
Well, who was dumb enough to volunteer their body to be a Klaus sublet?
I can think of better ways for us to spend our senior year than you buried in concrete, Tyler.
I need your support.
They shouldn't be here.
They're here to help you.
Let's go inside.
What the hell is Professor Shadypants doing here?
I invited him.
You have to invite me in.
You can come in.
If I'm gonna be a friend in your time of need, then you need to work on your punctuality.
Well, she's not here anymore.
Damon took Jeremy to the Gilbert lake house with Bonnie, so I guess her house is safe for her again.
Hey, listen, I got Klaus to tell me a little bit more about this hunter's sword.
You know that map in Jeremy's tattoo?
What's wrong?
We need to get our hands on that sword, like, today.
Tyler and his hybrids are taking out Klaus tonight.
Here to steal tiny Tim's crutches?
Dickens was a dark man.
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.
Don't want to be a high-school cautionary tale at the next town meeting.
Well, then, it's a good thing the high-school part is nearly over.
If we're gonna be nice to each other, then I will need that glass of champagne.
Is that our thing?
We don't have a "thing."
Allow me.
Try the sock drawer.
People leave the sketchiest stuff in sock drawers.
I'm gonna need real ideas, Damon.
Kill Tyler before he goes to Klaus, or, since Klaus has suddenly become MVP in our relay race for the cure, tell him about the hybrids.
Not well.
All Jeremy feels when he sees a vampire is a burning desire to kill them.
Even if consciously he doesn't want to, as in your case, it's his subconscious that's calling the shots.
Persuasion helps reverse your conscious thoughts.
Think of it as kind of a conditioned response, right?
See vampire, kill vampire.
And that gives him a choice.
He can choose to take the detour instead of the conditioned response.
Every holiday, we came here.
They would have wanted us to stick together, Jer...
To fight for each other no matter what.
Jeremy, how do you feel about Elena right now?
She's just the reason that everyone I've ever loved has died.
She means nothing to me.
I will kill her, even if that means I die myself.
Did it work?
Well, that's not gonna happen.
You told him?
I've had 12 hybrids sworn to secrecy for a month.
I have Hayley and a witch risking their lives, and you're blabbing my plan to him?
You and Klaus already served one of them up for Jeremy to kill.
I don't owe you anything.
I'm taking him out.
Sorry, man, but you don't have a choice.
You're not allowed to feel this sorry for yourself unless you're sitting on a bar stool.
Fortunately, I travel with the bar.
It didn't work.
I shouldn't have put so much hope into reprogramming someone's mind.
Now that's barely a memory.
Maybe there's something else they can try.
Use these if you have to.
We go back to being werewolves, turning on every full moon.
We could give a rat's ass about the cure.
Tyler, come on.
I needed you on my side, care.
That's all I wanted.
You ok?
Shane wants to try again.
It's like dangling a cheeseburger in front of someone on a master cleanse.
Just find someone else to attach your warm and fuzzy detour feelings to.
Gee, I wonder who that could be.
You.
I feel that way about you.
It was good thinking using Bonnie as Jeremy's emotional touchstone.
Damon is very intuitive.
And Bonnie told me about your relationship with him.
You know, in all my world travels, the one spell that I've never found is how to break somebody from loving too much.
Trust me, I've looked.
If your hypno-herbs work, we should be singing "Kumbaya" around the fire by dinner.
So now tell me why I'm not killing you.
Damon.
I didn't say I was looking for the cure, but I can tell you where to find it.
Klaus' sword will tell us where to find it.
The sword will lead you there, sure, but so can I.
What?
Quick, a toast before people can can judge us.
What's wrong?
Please say something.
But you'll miss graduation.
Which... I guess is a ridiculous thing to worry about.
I'm their Alpha.
They're looking to me to help them.
You do what you have to do, Tyler.
He'd be proud of you, you know.
You're a leader of people, just like he was.
Thank you, mom.
It's a rock.
So he and his best friend, another witch, made an immortality spell, and then Silas' best friend witch got jealous and killed Silas' girl before he had a chance to make her immortal.
So it's a cure for immortality?
Human blood is the life force of an immortal.
Sure you are, sweetie.
Relax.
It's my brother.
What's up?
Don't ask how or why or who, but I just found the answer to your Tyler problem.
You're kidding.
This is the mark of the brotherhood of the five.
Then up the arm, you have the murder of a girl by a witch.
The symbols in the vines are your map, which you obviously no longer need.
When this mark is complete, it will contain the spell that we need to dig up Silas.
And where did you say he was buried?
The location is how I'm gonna survive your bad moods.
And what's in it for you?
If not the cure, then what?
I'm in this for Silas, all right?
Up until this point, he's only been myth.
So write a thesis.
How the hell did you even get out?
I got out because even your idiot hybrids recognized the stupidity of your Alpha hybrid martyr plan.
I'm not going to fight with you anymore, Caroline.
Oh, we're gonna do plenty of fighting, the second that you shove Klaus into someone else's body.
We dump Klaus into her body and bury her.
We just killed two original birds with one stone.
It's too late to change the plans.
I got to go find my mom, let her know I might actually graduate.
How's it going?
I think we're making progress.
Caroline, hey.
Bonnie, I need you to think fast.
Do you need my help?
I can leave Elena here with Jeremy.
I can't deal with this right now.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Jer and I should take these decorations home with us.
We could use the holiday cheer.
Look at you... suddenly Polly optimist.
Which you clearly don't.
Maybe because I think he blew up 12 people at the Young farm.
What?
I see we're back to the false accusation part of our relationship.
The pastor was severely depressed.
He had lost his wife to cancer, and he sought me out for a little supernatural assistance.
It's ok.
Elena, don't move, ok?
No matter what.
Jeremy, remember the detour.
She doesn't like me much.
Where have you been all day?
I've been around.
I'm not interested in vagaries, Stefan.
You've been dodgy and Caroline's been lovely, which I've come to recognize as a tool of distraction.
Now do you have something to share with me, or should I compel it out of you?
I broke into your safe to look for the sword.
Why?
Because I don't trust you.
I found the letters.
You have a few pen pals over the centuries?
Well, is keeping my victims' letters really so different from writing their names on a wall, like you did, ripper?
Loneliness, Stefan.
That's why you and I memorialize our dead.
There's the briefest of moments before we kill where we literally hold their life in our hands, and then we rip it away, and we're left with nothing.
Oh, my gosh!
Caroline!
Holy crap!
Have you seen Hayley?
Hayley is trying to screw this up.
Forget everything you just saw and heard.
How come the only time April Young isn't following you around like a lost puppy is when I'm lying dead with a broken neck?
April saw you?
You're supposed to be taking the witch to the cellar.
There is no witch, Tyler.
What?
I made it up.
What?
There needed to be 12 for the sacrifice, Tyler.
12 what?
I'm sorry.
Hayley, what did you do?
If you run now, you might make it out alive.
Where is Tyler Lockwood?
You'd do well to answer me, love.
I don't know.
Wrong answer.
Check this out.
Jenna used that to make out with Logan fell.
All the drama, and you're missing the actual fun part.
Damon, you can't keep telling me that this isn't real.
I know how I feel and that you feel it, too, so stop fighting it.
I want that again for you.
You're thinking about how upset he'll be when he finds out that you and I are together.
I was supposed to invoke the sire bond, Elena, send you away.
I was supposed to do the right thing by you and the right thing by my brother.
Which is what I'm gonna do right now.
I'm setting you free, Elena.
This is what I want.
This is what will make me happy.
Is this you in crisis mode?
Because it's a lot more stealth than mine.
And I'm sitting here trying to figure out what makes us any better than him.
And I think it's just that we have family we can trust.
Have you heard from Damon?
They're together, aren't they?
How together are they?
Caroline, tell me.
How together are they?
Thank you.
I was ready to fight you on this, but suddenly every part of my body is telling me that I need to get in this car and leave you.
So do it.
Tyler, honey, you're supposed to be in my sober cab.
I think I drank half the party.
Good evening, Carol.
And you're all he has.
There's a beautiful symmetry to that, don't you think?
Previously on Revenge...
Daniel's on a digging mission about my father investing in Nolcorp.
I'm your CFO and you can't tell me where nearly half a billion dollars went.
It all went to the daughter of our first investor.
I'm glad you came to your senses, Porter.
Matt, what the hell are you doing?
We have to block him from taking control of the board, no matter what it takes.
For the righteous, a revelation is a joyous event, the realization of a divine truth.
But for the wicked, revelations can be far more terrifying, when dark secrets are exposed and sinners are punished for their trespasses.
You better not cross this one, Conrad.
You have no idea.
You are out of practice.
Yeah, well, leisure time has been in short supply of late.
Daniel's talk of delivering Nolcorp is a persuasive argument.
Trust me, this is not the game changer my son believes it to be.
Still, some are listening.
Well, some isn't enough.
They need a two-thirds majority to oust Conrad.
Which, assuming your influence over the core members of the board remains absolute, should prove pretty much impossible.
My block will vote with me, whichever way I choose to go.
Do me the honor?
Only rather than building his fortune business by business, he married into it.
He and Conrad certainly appear cozy.
Grobet has voted Conrad's interest in every major decision since his appointment to the board in '99.
You think we can flip his vote?
I think Grobet is a greedy bastard like the rest of them.
I wasn't expecting an actual firing squad.
Look, I'll leave you two to, uh, do your thing.
Well, now that I'm in the belly of the beast, care to explain?
I need Salvador Grobet to see that Daniel's acquisition of Nolcorp isn't just a pipe dream.
Your being here makes it credible.
I'm sorry about your company, Nolan.
Well, that's for me to know, and you to find out.
Oh, how's that feel?
Not so fun, huh?
Just be careful.
Nobody plays dirtier than the Graysons.
All right.
Bye.
That's Dad's address book.
Yeah, I'm inviting, uh, some of his old crew to the christening.
A lot of these guys really stepped up when he died, told me not to be a stranger.
That's nice.
Actually, it was Kenny's idea.
Well, mine and Nate's father died suddenly, too.
You know, we miss him every day.
I thought you were waiting for Bull to say yes.
Don't be a dipstick.
Dipstick?
Actually, I'm glad you guys are both here.
You really saved our hides with this place, and I was hoping you'd come to my son's christening tomorrow.
Yeah, we'd be honored to.
Looking forward to meeting some of your dad's old pals, get a sense of the history of this place.
- Right, Nate?
- Absolutely.
In fact, open bar for all your guests after the ceremony, on us.
And who is this lovely belleza?
Nice meeting you.
He's been spearheading the Nolcorp acquisition with me.
I spotted you speaking with Mr. Ross earlier.
Yes, I, uh, invited him last minute.
A little glad-handing never hurt a negotiation.
Mr. Takeda taught you well.
Where's your wife today, Salvador?
Sadly, Magda couldn't make the trip.
I'm afraid I'm left to entertain myself.
Well, I will be happy to organize activities to fill your time.
Oh, I'd love that, Ms. Davenport.
Would you like to take a turn, Daniel?
Why not?
Beautiful women seem to fall from the skies.
Oh, you're too kind.
Salvador Grobet, Emily Thorne.
Ms. Thorne is considering a sizable investment in Grayson Global.
And what is your hesitation?
I'm a cautious person.
Would you care for a cold drink, Mr. Grobet?
Take the lead, please.
Nice shot.
Your aim has improved.
Well, I taught her a thing or two.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Mr. Grobet's approval is key to securing my leadership at the company.
I'm happy to help.
Have a nice day.
We need to discuss your son's future.
Oh, on the contrary.
As the changing of the guard at Grayson Global appears imminent, your usefulness to us seems to have run its course.
You leave my son out of this.
In the unlikely event the vote swings your way, we're willing to reconsider, but be warned.
If you attempt to alert Daniel in any way to our resurgent relationship, your son will be removed from the equation permanently.
Hello, Victoria.
I swear, you so much as lay a hand on my son, and I will kill you myself!
Hello? Prepare to enter the lion's den.
Nolan, Ms. Lahari, thanks for agreeing to the meeting.
Let's not make this any more unpleasant than it needs to be.
Actually, new details have emerged that alter those terms.
What's going on?
- What are you doing here, Marco?
What he shared with me, however, was a far more interesting story about a missing $500-million bank account.
What did you tell him?
Marco here claims he set up an offshore account for you as a tax shelter back in 2002... an account that was mysteriously drained a week before Nolcorp went public.
You want the money?
I mean, we're talking interest, penalties, and a potential criminal investigation.
But I am willing to forgo all that if we can come to a swift agreement.
51% controlling interest in Nolcorp and your continued good faith services as its C.E.O. and visionary.
Well-played, boss.
Guess it looks like I work for Grayson Global now.
See you around, Marco.
Success suits you.
I don't remember you ever looking more dashing.
Wall Street's new golden boy.
It's not like I did it alone.
Now that Nolcorp is secure, I can bring Aiden back in.
Mr. Grobet seemed to take a shine to him.
He should be the one to deliver the good news.
No, it should be you.
And he would be the first to tell you.
Not after what happened with Tyler.
Remember him?
I've spent the past year trying to forget him.
I'm only suggesting that you take things slow with him, make sure he's been properly vetted before he gets in any deeper.
Hello, Lady Macbeth.
Ah, right on cue.
- Evening, Daniel.
- Is this a bad time?
When should we convene?
I'll get back to you on that.
But thanks for all your support.
My pleasure.
Ashley's turning Daniel against you.
We turn Daniel against Ashley.
Okay, Ems.
It's in his D.N.A.
- Is the video encrypted yet?
- Uploading now.
Which should put your pale British shadow back in Danny's good graces.
Top of the morning, Mathis.
Off to the chapel.
Coming, Ems?
Who is this Porter fellow to you anyway?
An old friend.
Old friend, that all he is?
Could've been something more.
Another casualty of what we do.
Hey, you don't have to keep secrets from me.
I'm not.
I know.
Old habits.
Look, I'll be, uh, right here when you get back.
Mr. Grobet, what a lovely surprise.
And for me as well.
I assume that you spoke with Daniel.
I did, and I'm very impressed.
We're still on track, I presume.
I should speak to your husband.
Ms. Davenport.
Emily Rebecca Thorne.
Do you renounce Satan and all his empty promises?
Do you vow to protect this child, to stave off sin, and shield him from evil?
I hope you don't mind me crashing.
What are the Ryan brothers doing here?
Oh, Kenny Ryan bought in to the bar.
You know those guys?
I woulda lost the bar if it weren't for their help.
They don't help anybody.
Get 'em out.
Listen, I don't deny that you have helped make me a very wealthy man.
Using your wife's money to do it.
Good question, Conrad.
Perhaps I'll leave it to you to find an answer.
Oh, well, then, you're still persuadable?
Not by anything you possess.
Well?
He's going with Daniel.
Don't pretend for one second that you give a damn about that boy.
A clue, perhaps, as to what the hell you're talking about?
See for yourself.
You have wormed your way into the very nadir of repugnance.
Where did you get this?
From whoever seems to be circling this family with an endless catalog of our sins.
You and I were divorced at the time...
Oh, so you say.
It could've happened this morning for all I know.
Oh, what are you suggesting, that fidelity is one of your strong points?
And as for Daniel, he had yet to commence his misguided relationship with dear Ms. Davenport.
A relationship you allowed to proceed without mentioning your own pathetic lack of impulse control.
We can discuss how that theoretical father-son chat would have unfolded at a later date.
Right now, we have more pressing problems.
Our upwardly mobile son not only closed the Nolcorp deal, he managed to wrest a controlling interest in that company, seemingly without impediment, which brings us to this little video that was so conveniently dispatched to you right in the midst of our current crisis.
Now what is the one entity with the only real ability to make and the motive to use this recording?
The Initiative.
Victoria, they are trying to drive a wedge between us because they sense a change in the headwinds.
They're going all in on Daniel, aren't they?
My parents aren't exactly the best role models in the world, which shouldn't surprise anyone who reads the internet, watches TV, is alive.
I need to go.
Emily, wait up.
You're just taking off without telling anyone.
You're my family, too.
Maybe.
Why, 'cause your off on another mission to destroy someone else's life?
I'm not destroying lives, Amanda.
I'm righting wrongs.
Tell yourself whatever you have to, but when will enough be enough?
Look, just say good-bye to Jack for me.
Envisioning your future?
I didn't know that you were there.
Undoubtedly.
I used to do the very same thing.
Plan out my path, identify the obstacles, visualize the next six months, one year, five years...
And as a result, all those thoughts became this.
You've made yourself quite at home at Grayson Manor as of late.
Still, I was hoping that you could assist me with a matter that's come to my attention.
- Please, you must understand...
Which part, that you seduced my husband, or that you hid it from my all-too-trusting son?
It was a terrible mistake.
Put yourself in the same position.
Can you honestly say that you wouldn't have done the exact same thing?
Oh, well, my judgment's not in question here, nor my future.
And we both know it would be a simple pleasure to annihilate you.
Please, Victoria.
Don't destroy what I have with Daniel.
I love him.
I swear, I will do anything to put this right.
I'm counting on it.
Yes.
No.
That's not an option.
I forgot that I have to butter up some donors for the Heal the Sound benefit.
Something wrong?
Daniel, no one's ever been kinder to me than you.
You're welcome, babe.
Now hurry up so you can get back here.
- You're good to go.
Aiden, what's up?
Not on the phone.
I'm on my way.
Not for much longer.
Text me their names, and I'll...
Thanks.
It's not your usual hangout, last I remember.
She never saw a penny of that fortune you allegedly put aside for her, did she?
Well, I offered you a payout, which you threw back in my face, literally.
I didn't want a payout, Nolan.
I want my old job back.
I helped to build Nolcorp from the ground up, and you know that.
Padma is so much better for me than you ever were.
Why, because she's easier to fool?
Padma knows exactly who I am.
I've told her everything.
Except for the fact that you're allowing Amanda Clarke and your best friend to live above a bar, clueless about the money that's rightfully hers.
I want to know why you left me out of the final negotiations with Nolcorp.
Without my efforts, the Nolcorp acquisition would never have gotten off the launchpad.
'Cause I've only known you for a few weeks, and I've been advised to have you further vetted.
Advised by whom?
What, your girlfriend?
Because if she's the bar by which you measure fidelity, then there's something you need to know.
Hey, please.
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.
Unless you want me to hand your wife the easiest, and for you, the costliest divorce in history, your vote is mine tomorrow.
Get your stuff out of my house, Ashley.
Unfortunately for your husband, it seems Daniel inherited twice your ruthlessness.
I'll side with the boy, and those loyal to me will follow.
- He's won, hasn't he?
It'd be like signing his death warrant.
Daniel, before you go in there, please give us five minutes.
You've got two.
I've known you two to be capable of some pretty vile things, but you've outdone yourselves this time.
Now what the hell are you holding over Ashley that would compel her to degrade herself like this?
The truth is, that I will do whatever it takes to protect you.
I recognize that you're ambitious, but you are young.
Winning that vote today will put you in unspeakable danger.
Fine.
Tell me what kind of danger I'm in.
I can't.
As expected.
The depths you'll go to stay in power are shameless.
Yeah, it was a beautiful ceremony, though.
Your dad would've been proud.
Is, uh, Jack around?
Are his business partners around?
- Nate and Kenny?
Want me to walk up with you?
Know what?
I don't have anything to say to you boys.
Well, that's too bad.
We got a lot of questions for you, mainly about what happened to our old man six years ago.
I don't know anything about it.
See, we don't believe that's true.
You know why?
'Cause the last thing he says to us was, he had a meeting right here with your old pal Carl Porter.
Same night your kid was sideswiped by a car.
After that, we never heard from him again.
I spent that night in the hospital.
That's not the whole story, is it?
See if I can't find a way to jog your memory.
Thank you so much.
It's over.
Salvador voted with Daniel, and the board did the same.
Mr. Grobet, thank you for your vote.
I suggest you smile and shake my hand.
All right.
Emily, what a nice surprise.
I think I may have found my calling.
What brings you to the city?
Actually, I was just hoping to steal Aiden for a bit.
Well, he's your man.
I just need him for two seconds.
Absolutely.
I know I am.
Congratulations.
I knew you could do it.
My leadership was not the only piece of new business that came to pass today.
The board also elected to close ranks while the company goes through this transition.
Meaning?
Meaning there's no room for you on the board unless someone willingly vacates, and I don't see that happening anytime soon, as the Nolcorp deal just increased our bottom line by 30%.
What you lookin' for?
Does the name Joe Ryan mean anything to you?
I am telling you, he's their father.
I dug up an article from November of '06.
- Yeah, well, looks like your new buddy Nate took a page from Dad's playbook.
He just wrapped up a five-year vacay at Rikers for drug trafficking.
Jack, these guys are seriously bad dudes.
There's a man out there covered in blood.
I think he's dying.
Stay with the baby!
No, Jack...
What happened?
No.
No cops.
- Get her outta here.
- Charlotte, come on.
The... the Ryans...
They did this to you?
That's crazy.
My dad would never do something like that.
I used his gun.
He hid it on your boat to protect me.
They're not your friends, Jack.
They want payback.
Needless to say, you were right to keep Daniel in the dark this afternoon.
The boy will soon run the company toward the ground, proving little use to the Initiative.
On the contrary.
I think he handled himself very well today.
Seemingly.
But his vaulting ambition will bring him down as swiftly as it propped him up.
What the hell was that for?
Take your pick.
Evening, Jack.
Thought we should check on you guys.
Some friend of your father's or something?
Matt Duncan.
Luckily I got him to the hospital in time.
Most people wouldn't get involved.
Guess we should all keep our eyes open then.
That was a nice christening today.
Sleep tight.
- What's going on?
- Last one.
So it's done.
We're an official subsidiary of Grayson Global.
Nolan, I'm sorry.
- I feel responsible.
- Don't.
Remember when I asked you how far you'd be willing to go to defend this company?
First rule of dirty dealing, always have a contingency plan that bites your opponent in the ass harder than they bit you.
What kind of plan?
Just know that I have no intention of letting those bastards profit off David Clarke.
But why wait?
Why not hit them now?
Oh, when I'm finished, young Daniel won't know what hit him.
Always burning the midnight oil.
Should I call security?
That's a good question, Nolan.
What?
After what he did?
That's insane.
Actually, it's just smart business.
Right, Nolan?
I was gonna say "happy."
But right now I'm happy.
Being with you is the only time I've ever felt peace.
Everything is in place.
With the ultimate power to destroy all that we cherish most.
Shall we put the plan to a vote?
Victoria.
Oh, I see you have company.
Why don't you call me when you're alone?
Well, that was unexpected.
Who was that?
Leverage.
Don't worry, the Holy Rollers are still up by one on the Pin Pals.
Thank God Otto had that psychotic break and quit the team.
Just granny-throw it!
Boys, I'm afraid the government has finally caught up with me and my appeals are exhausted.
Tomorrow, I begin serving jury duty.
I felt bad for the guy, sitting there at his little card table.
Anyway, I must name a temporary replacement.
Your temporary don is... our accountant, Dan.
Fat Tony, a word?
Sad, right?
Well, once again, laughter is the worst medicine.
It's not the vegetarianism.
It's like swallowing dollhouse furniture.
Gentlemen, look at what we are spending every month just on olive oil.
A kid's never lonely when he has bologna.
You're that Simpson kid, Bart, right?
So, you're saying you'd rather do the prettiest dude in the world than the ugliest broad?
Attention, Gourmands of All Things Creepy and Crawly.
Hey, waiter, there's no fly in my soup.
Sorry.
Just-a once, why can't they go to Applebee's?
What are you doing?
If you don't like it, tough tortellini!
I live at a-one, a-two, a-three, Main-a Street.
So, if I'm growing grasshoppers to eat, am I farmer or a rancher?
There are going to be a lot of heated blogs on this topic.
Lisa, dinnertime!
Oh, you did that to help me out.
Not sure what your motivation for that is.
But the only other cuts left are personnel.
There are redundancies.
You jedrool, in our business, you don't lay them off, you lay them out.
What?
You have breasts like woman, but cannot give suck.
Quit saying that!
Get along, little buggies.
This is what you've been dipping in chocolate.
I've been meat-walking.
Saved the tear.
They fired me for not being tough.
I had learned that in order to succeed, you must disregard the dangerous distraction of being human.
And it brought me here.
This is how I get out of doing the dishes.
I hate that expression!
So overused!
Say something original!
Uh, Greek thing, uh, grand b-banana of... far-na... of f-forever thing, bleeks blah-blah, a comma... a com... a commonality beret burrito.
Oh, it looks like a kidnapping in progress, Chief.
You always frame everything in the worst possible light.
Chief, can I ask-- why do you want to be a policeman?
Adrenaline junkie.
My dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by.
Could you please not sound like you like it so much?
It's a party.
I'm going to call you Buggy, and I'll call you-- please don't go in my mouth.
I really think that's coming from our house.
Will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?
Next, we've got three screams from Scream 3.
Boy, never go into their directors training program.
How about the Disney Minority Program?
Now, how would you qualify for that?
Are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?
I'll fix that later.
Your Honor, we have reached a verdict.
There's a great one, but you'll never get it out of me.
On vacation, he digs wells in Darfur!
Damn it!
Pay attention, players.
I remember when you were Alphonse Trebagoogoo.
...not guilty.
I'll have your money in an hour.
You really should tweet less.
But everyone deserves to know what I'm thinking all the time.
Just listen, if you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are.
Look, just give me the gun before you hurt somebody.
Give it to me.
Oh, I can't kill you.
Let's see how weak I am with the gun.
Yeah, well, yeah, but see who's got it now.
When I have a gun, I'm not weak at all.
Clean-up on aisle me.
Okay, Mom, I think that's far enough.
Finally, a place where you can spread your wings and hop.
We're free!
No, no, I'm still gonna figure this out.
There was a corner here.
So, Tone, you're sure you didn't order those fiduciary- related whacks?
The important thing is we have severely cut costs by reducing the number of our guns to one.
And I have it.
Any further questions?
Can you hurry this up, please?
My daughter's got cheerleading practice.
Is there some kind of problem here?
And if not, can you do my belly button?
The greatest show on Earth.
Fun and educational for you, young sir.
Kemosabe?
I think you made a mistake, mister.
Mistake?
Who did you think I was, anyway?
Never take off mask.
Why not?
Dead man strike fear into heart of his enemy.
All right.
Let's do this.
Ladies and gentlemen, my colleague and I will be making a withdrawal.
I understand this bank is insured, so nobody move.
What's with the mask?
I guess I didn't make myself clear!
This is a damn bank robbery!
Wait a minute.
You're saying you're Tonto?
The Tonto?
There is another?
But the Lone Ranger and Tonto were good guys.
I mean, they didn't rob banks.
Did they?
Come a time, kemosabe when good man must wear mask.
The unification of this great country of ours by iron rail.
As long as there is peace between us all land treaties shall be honoured.
But to the outlaw, those who prey upon the weak, make no mistake, law and order has come to the Wild West.
The future is bright, ladies and gentlemen, and it's just around the bend.
Run a man all the way to state line, put him on a train and ship him right back.
Don't make no sense.
Guess they run out of hanging rope in Oklahoma.
Mr Cole wants to make an example.
Word is, Cavendish is looking for payback with you, Dan.
I heard it was the eyes.
Don't see how it makes a difference.
What's the matter with him?
It's not Cavendish he's worried about.
Care to pray with us?
We're Presbyterian.
I'm much obliged, ma'am, but this, here, is my bible.
It's almost hanging time, Butch.
Do you hear what I said, boy?
I'm gonna enjoy watching them wipe that look off your face.
Very pretty.
She's right.
It matches your eyes.
I didn't think you'd make it out, Mrs Reid.
Well, I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
And, um, what do you think of our endeavour?
Looks to me like just a lot of men digging in the desert.
That true, Mama?
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.
Here, let me show you.
Oh, I expect on a lawman's salary, quite a lot falls on you.
We do just fine.
I just hate to see a bird in a cage.
Piss break, boss.
Afternoon, ladies.
There's no need for violence, my son.
Fifteen hours, I watched you feed that bird.
Gets on a man's nerves.
I do not fear what comes next.
Nothing comes next.
Nice suit.
Time has finally come, Windigo.
Do I know you, lnjun?
You know me.
What kind of a lawman don't carry his own gun?
The future.
A lawyer and a crazy lnjun.
Bet you two got a lot to talk about.
Best make it quick.
Sing it to me!
Should be slowing down by now.
Anyway, I'm sure we'll be at the station any minute.
Jesus, we ought to go.
That's reinforced Bethlehem steel.
Any attempts at escape is futile.
That's great!
That's the end of the line.
We jump.
What about the passengers?
They jump.
There are children on board.
All jump.
No, you're not going anywhere.
Thank you.
Why don't you put that thing down, and we'll settle this like men?
Great warrior.
Yeah, that's my brother.
Nice suit.
I'm not leaving these passengers!
It's jammed!
Give me a hand.
You hold.
John.
Hey, hold it right there.
I'm afraid I have to take you in.
Do you hear me?
You speak English, don't you?
He was on that train for a reason, Dan.
Probably.
What's your crime, boy?
Indian.
And a man, in the eyes of the law.
Now, throw me your cuffs.
Whatever you say, little brother.
it's nothing personal.
Dan?
John.
They said there was an accident and someone fell off the train.
Actually, it was me.
Dan's fine.
Come here.
God, it's good to see you.
What's it been, nine years?
Eight, since you stopped writing.
We were just kids back then.
Well, he takes good care of you, I see.
He spends most his time in Indian territory these days.
Indian territory?
Doesn't sound like Dan.
Well, you should stay with us at Willow Creek.
I don't know.
Oh, God, look at you.
City boy.
Why would you ever want to come back here?
It's my home.
Who are you?
Danny, this is your Uncle John.
Why, you look just like your dad did when he was your age.
They're going out again.
Well, I'm coming with you.
The law looks a lot different on the ground, little brother.
Well, it doesn't include vengeance, no matter where you're standing.
That's John Locke's Treatises of Government.
Never thought to hear the likes of it in Colby.
Mr Cole, my brother John.
New county prosecutor.
Latham Cole?
John, here, is an educated man like yourself.
Well, let's try not to hold that against him.
You going after Cavendish?
Collins, here, picked up a trail.
Well enough.
Yeah, well, you see to it.
A simple task.
Collect the prisoner, deliver him to his execution.
Maybe you should think about staying in town for a few days.
Comanche are restless.
They're always restless, but they keep to their side of the river, and I keep to mine.
Besides, fences won't put themselves up.
It's my job.
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.
I am happy.
Is that new?
Matches your eyes.
Like old times, huh?
Thank you.
All right, Mr Prosecutor.
Let's see how your due process fares on the trail.
It's Dad's.
I hereby deputise you a Texas Ranger.
But I can't help you with them clothes.
Indians call that your spirit horse.
You can't scare me with your ghost stories any more, Dan.
Since when did you start wearing Indian jewellery, anyway?
They didn't have a bigger one?
He missed you.
Could have fooled me.
You smell like a distillery already.
Steadies the hand.
You even sleep last night?
Could go by the flats.
No cover.
What do you figure, Dan?
Figure Collins should go take a look.
If he can stay in the saddle.
I'll take my chances.
Where the hell's Collins?
Ambush!
She always loved you.
Take care of her for me.
It's been a long time, Ranger.
You've looked better.
I heard them boys in Tulsa took a real shine to you.
All heart, ain't you?
A year you took from me in that sweatbox.
Deal dies with you, old friend.
Even Dan?
Dan very dead.
But he's the Lone Ranger.
Would have been much easier, I agree.
Greetings, noble spirit horse.
You come.
Him great warrior.
Him strong brother.
Want him, bring him back.
If you are going to sneak up on an Indian, best to do it downwind.
Why are you talking to that horse?
My grandfather spoke of a time when animals could speak.
When you get them alone, some still do.
But I cannot decide whether this horse is stupid, or pretending to be stupid.
Why am I covered in dirt?
Because I buried you.
Then why am I alive?
Horse definitely stupid.
Are those my boots?
He cut out his heart.
What kind of a man does something like that?
Not a man.
An evil spirit born in the empty spaces of the desert.
With a hunger that cannot be satisfied.
And the power to throw nature out of balance.
My people call this spirit "windigo."
I am Tonto of the Comanche, last of the windigo hunters.
So, what do you want with me?
A vision told me a great warrior and Spirit Walker would help me on my quest.
He would have been good.
But who am I to question the great father, hmm?
All I know is a man killed my brother, and I'll see him hang for it.
Then you will need this.
Right.
I, too, seek the windigo Butch Cavendish.
Good.
Actually, I think I saved your life.
What the hell was that for?
Bird angry.
Where do you go?
Into town, to form a posse.
Collins.
He's known us since we were kids.
You find traitor, you find the man who killed your brother.
That's my brother's vest.
Eyes, cut by the bullets that killed him.
You want me to wear a mask?
The men you seek think you are dead, kemosabe.
Better to stay that way.
All right, but if we ride together, it's to bring these men to justice in a court of law.
Is that understood?
Justice is what I seek, kemosabe.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, into the Hall of Human Deformities.
I'm looking for a man.
I bet.
Got money?
Of course.
Where did you get that?
Make trade.
With a dead man?
Hard bargain.
Sickness of greed is strong.
What about her?
So how do you know all this?
A vision said it would be so.
What's with the mask?
Second thought, don't answer that.
Railroaders?
Are you referring to Mr Cole?
Mr Cole gelding.
No free rides, gentlemen!
Scrimshaw.
Ivory.
We're looking for a man named Collins.
He's a tracker, speaks Indian.
It is a house of sin.
Unrefrigerated.
Homer, help these morons find the door.
Windigo getting away.
What the hell is he talking about?
That's right.
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Said his name was, uh, Reid.
Dan Reid?
Had themselves a hell of an argument.
Paid me with this.
Do not touch rock!
Rock cursed.
Do you have cat?
Red, we got trouble.
What are you doing?
Some of my clientele don't take kindly to an Indian on the premises.
- Treaty?
Fear of cat.
Just make that animal pay for what he took from me.
Nature is indeed out of balance.
Must to go, drunken beast!
'Tis judgment day, harlot!
Where are they?
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
Ma'am, I believe I've located your cat.
Come on, Danny.
Get yourselves inside!
Pilar, get the shutters.
Pilar, fire!
Indian savages.
Was not Indian.
The hell it wasn't.
Indians make trade.
Leave him alone.
I said leave him alone!
Tell me, kemosabe, what does the white man kill for?
This one's nice, ain't it?
I love me some aquamarine.
Not an Indian.
This ain't what it looks like, mister.
I just like them pretty things.
You tell me where they are, or I'll let the Indian do what he wants to you.
What does he want to do?
What the hell is going on?
You shoot anything that comes out.
Go for horse, kemosabe.
I cover you.
Why don't I cover you?
All right.
But we take them alive.
It's dark!
Spirit Walker.
What's with the mask?
What is it?
So, the horse, it can fly?
Don't be stupid.
Hold it right there.
Rebecca and Danny, where are they?
Isn't that right, boy?
I will take the Spaniard.
I haven't fired a gun in nine years.
Might want to keep that to yourself, kemosabe.
Great shot!
That was supposed to be a warning shot.
In that case, not so good.
What?
Nothing.
That was my brother's.
How am I supposed to find Rebecca and Danny now?
Tracks lead north, toward Indian country.
That's 400 square miles of rock and desert.
Even an Indian can't track through that.
We follow horse, kemosabe.
"Kemosa..." Why do you keep calling me that?
"Wrong brother."
Right.
My husband will kill you for this.
That'd be a trick.
Last time I saw your husband, he was drowning in his own blood.
Where's Barret and Jesus?
Fired one bullet and they didn't stand a chance.
You better start talking straight, Frank.
Now, who killed them?
It was a Ranger, Butch.
A lone Ranger.
Rangers are dead.
You shouldn't have done what you did.
- Shut up!
Let him come!
Scared, aren't you?
You should be.
"The Valley of Tears."
That's far enough.
Don't look at me.
He loved you.
I said, don't look at me.
Run.
Please, run.
Perhaps he want to make it look like Comanche violate treaty.
Horse dead.
We're lost, aren't we?
What's that?
Nothing!
That's just fantastic, isn't it?
The woman, Rebecca, you will fill her with child, no?
When you were on the other side, you spoke of her in your vision.
Yes, but you did not speak of her as the wife of your brother.
Well, she's his widow now.
So, it is better that she live the rest of her life alone?
Because I am a savage?
Would you stop?
What is that?
Track!
That's impossible.
Train track.
You are lost, aren't you?
Train tracks?
I thought you were in Indian territory.
From here on, all treaties with the Indian Nation are null and void.
We will be in Promontory Summit ahead of schedule, three days from today!
I had to dip into petty cash.
Put it somewhere safe.
Where would that be?
Use your imagination.
I understand you have an Indian problem.
Right on time.
Apache?
Not so much.
What are they doing?
Death dance.
Wait.
White man does not know this.
My name's John Reid, and I know that you didn't raid those settlements.
If you let me go, I can prove it.
There doesn't have to be a war, understand?
Comanche gesture of respect?
What's with the mask?
That's funny?
He's one of you.
No more.
What do you mean?
His mind is broken.
He is a band apart.
Many moons ago, a boy found two white men in the desert.
He brought them to his village to be healed.
When they found silver in the river, they asked the boy where it came from.
They took what they could carry, but they wanted to keep the place a secret, so they could one day return.
The boy could not live with what he had done, so he decided the men were possessed by evil spirits in the silver.
But he is too late.
There is no more tribe to return to.
Our time has passed.
They call it "progress."
You're John Reid, brother of Dan.
By this totem, your brother swore if we kept the peace, he would protect our land.
Now the Cavalry cut down our children.
And if you let me go, I'll keep his promise.
So, we have a deal?
Not so much.
My name come up?
Please, this is a mistake.
There doesn't need to be a war.
It makes no difference.
We are already ghosts.
Cavalry.
Let us bring the pure sceptre of Almighty God to the heathens!
Oh, thank God!
Civilisation.
We'll just explain the entire situation, and we'll get this whole misunderstanding cleared up.
Wait!
Perhaps they didn't see us.
Could be worse.
Worse?
How could this be worse?
I'm not talking to you any more.
What is that?
You hear it, too?
I was hoping it was in my head.
This is worse.
Hello again.
Any chance you could...
Here we go, okay, go!
Going, kemosabe?
Exactly.
It is a good day to die.
Yeah, well, same to you.
Where the river begins.
What the hell is that damn noise?
He the one doing the talking?
That's right.
They don't even speak English, Butch.
I think they understood.
Now go show them there's nothing to be afraid of.
Do I have to ask twice?
I've been thinking.
Why don't we just take what we can carry and get out of here?
Scraps?
You think I waited 20 years for scraps?
Get in there.
It can't be.
The Rangers are dead.
Where are they?
You're dead.
If you hurt them, I swear to God, I'll make you pay.
...to the full extent of the law.
I'll be damned.
Lawyer and a crazy lnjun.
Tell me.
You're just a man in a mask.
You're no different than me.
Finish him.
This isn't justice.
Justice is what a man must take for himself.
No, I can't believe that.
Where is brother's justice?
I'm not a savage.
You are not a man.
Now, windigo must die.
There's no such thing as a wendingo.
You made it up.
Like you make up everything.
You sold out your whole village for a watch.
There's no such thing as cursed silver, or a Spirit Walker for that matter.
I'm not like you.
I have a tribe.
You're wrong.
Go back to your tribe, white coward.
I do not need you.
Look at me.
See the face of my people as you die.
I knew I could count on you, Counsellor.
Shut up.
Drink.
Feel better.
Your tactics have been most effective, Captain.
With the natives in retreat, we'll be in Promontory Summit ahead of schedule.
Believe me, what they have done to the settlements we have given back tenfold.
Tenfold.
Danny, I told you, take it easy on the corners and press down on the straightaway.
It's just a toy.
Come here, Danny.
I want to show you something.
Since the time of Alexander the Great no man has travelled faster than the horse that carried him.
Not any more.
Imagine, an entire continent connected by iron rail.
Whoever controls this, controls the future.
Power that makes emperors and kings look like fools.
You mean it's mine?
It could be, son.
Could be all yours.
Well, it was the least I could do after what you've been through.
You should consider yourself a lucky woman, Mrs Reid.
And now he has.
Heavenly Father, we call upon you in this, our hour of need.
For you are the shepherd that shall guide the wanderer through the desert.
You are the light that shall be his beacon in the darkness.
What is it, friend?
This is the man you've been looking for.
Butch Cavendish, just like one of those great lizards buried in the desert.
The last of a dying breed.
That's enough.
I brought this man in for justice.
Of course.
Soldier.
I'm just doing my job, Mrs Reid.
You wanna keep me in this room, you're gonna have to shoot me.
And don't let him leave.
Stupid white man.
How can I thank you for what you've done?
You can stop this war before it's too late.
All for this.
Come to think of it, not unlike your brother, Dan.
Men like that can't accept what we know to be true.
A man can't stay the same with the world evolving around him.
Remember me?
But a man can't choose his brother, can he?
It's almost as if his brother chooses him.
And now you've come back.
Train tracks.
That's what Dan found in Indian Territory, isn't it?
He knew there was gonna be a war and he wouldn't go along with it, so you had him killed.
Like I said, no vision.
Stop this train.
Oh, there's no stopping this train, John.
I think you know that.
Where's my daddy?
He's dead, Danny.
You trust me, don't you, Danny?
Look, Danny, I'm gonna put my gun away, okay?
Nice and slow.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Shoot him, son.
Is my daddy dead?
Just put the gun down.
Now, just put the gun down.
Captain, arrest these men.
This man is a common criminal trespassing on railway property.
Well, if what you say is true, that would mean I attacked the Comanche for no reason.
That's right, Captain.
Slaughter of the innocents.
Their blood on your hands.
Tenfold.
Are you capable of that?
Well, the way I see it, these men are with the rail road.
So, the question is, who the hell are you?
My God!
Out here, it's just rock.
Put it on a train, it's priceless.
What could you buy with all of that?
A country, Captain.
Get these Chinamen out of here!
Detail, halt!
Didn't you hear me, Chinaman?
I said, get out!
Please, don't do this.
You'll take care of us, like you said.
You don't have to do this.
Load!
I ain't gonna tell you again!
What the hell is that?
Shoulder arms!
Know what I learned in all that carnage?
Nothing is accomplished without sacrifice.
Ready!
What the hell just happened?
Get the train moving!
What was that?
Lord, save us.
Hold your positions, gentlemen!
Hold!
Steady!
Fire at Will!
Now... must to jump!
Kerosene?
Cover the flank!
You mean, they killed all of them?
You were right.
There is no justice.
Cole controls everything.
The rail road, the Cavalry, everything.
That is why you wear the mask.
Something very wrong with that horse.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to celebrate a dream.
And now I'd like to introduce the man who made that dream a reality.
The working men before you deserve your applause!
You missed something.
Where did you get the explosives?
I told you.
No, you didn't.
We had plan.
It was good plan.
This is a damn bank robbery!
What was that?
This way, gentlemen.
Bring the girl.
He's coming for you.
Just like Frank said.
What you got makes them Reid boys so hot under the collar, anyway?
Maybe I'll have a taste and find out.
The men around this table represent the finest families in our country as well as controlling interest in the Transcontinental Railway Corporation.
In essence, gentlemen, you work for me.
Have you lost your mind?
When it reaches the bank in San Francisco, that's 65 million dollars.
Have you checked the undercarriage?
Pleasure to see you, Red!
Seems I have a run in my stocking.
Ivory.
Make trade.
Boy, I'm talking to you!
This is an outrage!
I, for one, am not gonna sit here and negotiate with one of my employees.
Then, let's get down to it, shall we?
Gentlemen, our chairman has had to take a sudden leave of absence.
Any nominations?
I nominate Mr Latham Cole.
I accept
It's magnificent.
So clean.
Attention!
About face!
Everyone wants to touch it.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Train robbery.
A little higher.
How high does it go?
Almost there.
They're stealing my train.
Get the horses!
Right there!
Stop that train!
Shoot him, you idiot.
Mama!
Get me close!
How many times do I have to tell you to kill that Ranger?
I told you he'd come.
Let her go!
If you insist.
Go ahead.
What you gonna do, Counsellor?
Shoot me?
That's right.
Guess I cut out the wrong brother's heart.
What the hell?
As a matter of fact, I did.
End of the line.
We've been here before, haven't we?
Easy.
Where did you say that train was headed?
The future?
Well, this here train, she going straight to hell.
Enjoy the ride!
Wrong brother?
Not today.
Pretty soon, no one will even know you people were here.
I'm a Spirit Walker.
I can't miss.
Who are you?
Bad trade.
You let him get away?
The bridge.
What bridge?
"Bad trade."
A small token of our thanks.
There will be plenty more where that came from.
Always nice to have a lawman on the side of progress.
Time to take off the mask, son.
Not yet.
I can't stay.
I know.
But if that badge ever starts to weigh on you, well, you know where to find us.
Train's headed west.
There's nothing holding you here any more.
It's my home.
You're not a boy any more, Danny.
Your daddy would be proud.
You take care of your mama.
I thought I'd call him Silver.
You know, it isn't really a trade unless both parties agree.
Who would really trade a watch for some bird seed?
Bird cannot tell time, kemosabe.
I was thinking, "The Mask of Justice."
Do you know what "Tonto" means in Spanish?
It was nice to meet you, Mr Tonto.
I mean, I know he's not real.
Was he?
Up to you, kemosabe.
Never take off the mask.
Hi-yo, Silver!
Don't ever do that again.
subtitled by SELVAHEMA
Don't be shut out, friend.
He has travelled the world and baffled the crown princes of Europe.
To think, an hour ago I was just selling oil cakes on the midway.
A gift in honour of your debut.
Well, there are so many.
And this music box was the only thing to survive.
But I know that Grammie would want you to have it.
We're rehearsing.
I knocked.
Why didn't you say something?
Pitiful.
All right, this is your cut.
For you, the applause will be approbation enough.
Well, how do you think I feel?
A man of my talents, I should be playing the Orpheum Circuit!
Instead of some dusty Podunk... in a second-hand jacket falling apart at the seams.
But she's resting comfortably now in Abilene... expected to make a full recovery.
Perhaps you'd like to join her.
Now, remember, when I ask for a volunteer...
Let's go make some magic.
Ladies and gentlemen, the show has already begun.
Journey with me now, across those deserts... to the mystical lands of the Arabian Peninsula.
For 5,000 years... her lonely spirit has been trapped.
I shall require a volunteer from the audience.
How about you, madam?
Yes, I would like to volunteer.
Just remember what I told you.
A simple country girl, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, you have nothing to fear, just so long as you believe.
For when you do believe... anything is possible.
You are growing sleepy.
Your eyelids become heavy.
Come, Fernanda!
Allow yourself to merge with this woman before me.
Can you hear me, oh Queen Fernanda?
Then rise.
Rise!
I command you to rise!
Rise from your tomb of sand.
A wire!
Look, it's not much, but it's all that we have.
Whatever you could do.
I would make her walk, of course... but unfortunately there is a distemper in the ether tonight.
Why didn't you close the damn curtain sooner?
You know, you shouldn't be so mean to me all the time, Professor.
What I need is someone who knows when to close the damn curtain.
It's a woman.
Finally some good news.
You want me to wind up a music box?
Not for this one, Frank.
It was a wonderful show.
Don't tell me you watched that debacle.
I don't know why you didn't just tell that poor girl the truth.
It's not often enough, Oscar, seeing you once every few months.
Well, it is a travelling circus.
How's everything on the farm?
I need to tell you something, Oscar.
That's never a good start to a conversation.
John Gale asked me to marry him.
I think that's wonderful, Annie.
I said I had to think about it.
Men love that answer.
I wondered what you thought I should do.
You could do a lot worse than John Gale.
He's a good man.
So are you.
See, Kansas is full of good men.
Church-going men that get married and raise families.
Men like John Gale.
Men like my father... who spent his whole life tilling the dirt... just to die facedown in it.
I don't want that, Annie.
I don't want to be a good man, I want to be a great one.
I want to be Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison... all rolled into one.
That's all I ever wanted for you, you know.
Greatness.
But do you?
Professor, you need to look outside.
I'm gonna rip him in half!
Congratulations on the engagement.
I'm gonna crush you, Oz!
Mr Baum, I'll catch up with you in Milwaukee.
Half of that balloon is mine!
Please, I don't wanna die!
I haven't accomplished anything yet!
Somebody, help me!
Thank goodness.
I thought I was dead.
Unless you're an angel.
Am I in heaven?
There is still hope for me!
You won't regret this!
I saw you fall from the sky.
It's actually quite nice.
Get off!
Spiteful little things, aren't they?
Where am I, exactly?
Where do you think you are?
I have no idea.
But that's my name.
Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs.
But everyone calls me Oz.
The king's prophecy was true.
He said that a great wizard bearing the name of our land... will descend from the heavens, and save us all.
Your king?
Like, in a palace with a crown and a sceptre?
Yes, a beautiful sceptre and a grand palace.
And you will save all the people.
Was that a gold sceptre?
Yes, there's more gold than you could ever imagine.
We better hurry, or your reign will be over before it's begun!
Give me your leg.
Perhaps the Wicked Witch has summoned them back.
I don't think I like witches.
What?
I, too, am a witch.
Never mind.
That something might happen to you.
So, this Wicked Witch... just how wicked is she?
But my sister chased her away from the Emerald City.
I can't wait for her to meet you.
You know what I think we need?
A little music.
No one's ever given me anything just because they wanted to.
You don't know much about witches, do you?
Maybe not, but I'm told I'm a fast learner.
May I have this dance, milady?
Now you're gonna tell me no one's ever asked you to dance before.
Put your hand here.
And your other hand here.
Not only are you the Wizard... but you're the person I belong with.
Help me!
Somebody, save me!
That poor little creature.
Calm down, it's gonna be all right.
Not the vines, the lion!
Lion?
You were wonderful, Wizard.
"Wizard"?
All right, I've saved the day.
It was nothing, just a little prestidigitatic display.
- Shall we to the palace?
My name is Finley.
My master's home was ransacked by the Wicked Witch's baboons.
And I've been hiding in these woods ever since.
Well, he is cute.
Let's shake on it.
I got it.
You two run along.
It'll all be yours now.
It's a good thing green is my favourite colour.
You are going to make the best king Oz has ever known.
We'll spend a lifetime together.
But right now, there's thousands of people in Oz... waiting to witness your miracles.
Thousands?
That's a big show.
What now, Wizard?
Monkey, tell me again about that life debt.
I'll deal with her later.
We need to convince the good people of Oz... that they've found their wizard.
I shall blow a fanfare.
This is the Wizard.
How do you do, sir?
This is the Wizard?
Is there a problem?
The greatest, most powerful... and most genuine of real and true wizards.
A wizard of the highest moral rectitude.
He's just a real, good, solid wizard, everyone.
The Wizard, here he is.
Do you like it?
I do so hope you like it... because I've been personally watching over it, awaiting your arrival.
Much obliged.
Praise be you are here at last... and the prophecy shall be fulfilled.
This is a glorious day for us all.
Who is this fetching woman?
This is my sister.
I am Evanora, the royal advisor.
I have been protecting the Emerald City whilst we awaited your arrival.
I am here to serve you, as I served the king before you.
I look forward to being served.
Sister, I like him already.
My sceptre.
Yes, go on then, have a seat.
How does it feel?
Yes, Wizard, right away, oh, great and powerful one.
Isn't he wonderful?
Didn't I say he would come?
He is the Wizard.
Did it not occur to you... that he might be an imposter in league with the Wicked Witch... and sent here to kill us?
I'm not the one who's underestimating her cleverness.
Or maybe it's you I'm underestimating.
Have you finally joined her side, sister?
Deep down, you are wicked.
I am not wicked!
That temper really is wasted on you.
Do you honestly think... that I could conspire against you with her?
You are my sister and I love you.
But I do need proof that he is who he claims to be.
Giving tours?
Yes, boggling to the minds of all who witness it.
Well, there is one last room that I would like you to see.
The royal treasure of Oz.
It belongs to whoever is king.
Well, not quite yet.
You see, you only become the king after you defeat the Wicked Witch.
That's the prophecy.
And since you haven't done that yet, you're not...
And killing her won't be easy.
Wait a minute.
No one said anything about killing anybody.
She's a wicked witch.
I'm your wizard.
We're really gonna do this?
How hard could it be to kill a wicked witch?
Every lie you tell gets us one step closer to the Emerald City dungeon.
That is a vicious stereotype.
That looks bad.
What happened here?
Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you.
Everyone has.
I'll never get back together.
Should work.
They're coming back!
It's okay.
They're gone.
Everyone was so happy.
Last piece.
Would you like to try to stand?
I'm gonna let you go.
Now walk to me.
"Dark Forest."
On a witch hunt?
No, you're just a little girl.
I'm not as delicate as I look!
Listen, we have one rule in show business.
Never work with kids or animals.
And I'm already working with this thing.
Don't do that.
You're fine.
On a road in the middle of nowhere?
You'll die, you'll die, you'll die!
Did those crows just say that we were gonna die?
They did.
Wizard?
Come on.
I'm scared.
Think there are ghosts out here?
Evil spirits maybe?
Will you stop that?
Will you calm down?
Where are we?
This must be the place.
So, how are you gonna kill the Wicked Witch?
All I need to do is get her magic wand.
Once I destroy that, she's finished.
That must be her.
The Wicked Witch is the triangle.
Clear so far?
Are you really the Wizard?
Certainly not.
I'd remember a thing like that.
You've never been to Kansas?
What is Kansas?
Is that where you're from?
Evanora is the true Wicked Witch.
I'm so sorry, child.
Here's your wand.
Sorry I mooed.
Follow me.
I've looked everywhere, but he's gone.
What is it?
Sister, he's fulfilling the prophecy.
He'll bring her darkness to the light and peace to the land.
He came to my chambers last night.
I can still feel his body pressed against mine.
Are you quite sure it wasn't you who said it to him?
You fool!
Serves you right.
I want Glinda and that wizard torn to shreds.
Do not fail me a second time.
Fly!
On the day my father died, we lost a kind and noble leader.
And a dark shadow was cast across this land.
I've had to stand alone against Evanora and watch... as towns were destroyed, children were orphaned... and my heart was broken.
I've been unable to protect the good people of Oz by myself.
With only faith in my father's prophecy, I've waited.
For you... great Wizard from Kansas, to come and set things right.
So, that's the prophecy.
What do we do?
Wait, I hear something.
They're getting closer!
Look out!
It was the best I could do under the circumstances.
Not so hard.
They're getting closer!
Unless you've got something.
Just because she jumped off the cliff, you're gonna jump off the cliff?
I have wings.
Hey, is that a wall?
Does this thing have any brakes?
And all good-hearted souls get to pass through.
I'm gonna die!
It's beautiful.
You put the "merry" back in "the merry Land of Oz."
What are fireworks?
Remind me to show you sometime.
Glinda, I didn't know if you'd like these, or these.
They're both so beautiful, I couldn't possibly decide.
I can also tell you're weak, selfish... slightly egotistical and a fibber.
If you can make them believe, then you're wizard enough.
These are desperate times, after all.
Can you make them believe?
Will I still get that gold?
What's the matter, sister?
Look at how happy they are.
What did you expect?
Such is a broken heart.
Your precious wizard did that to you.
Make it stop.
Would you like me to?
One bite is all it takes.
One bite and your world will change forever.
One bite and your heart will become impenetrable.
One bite and you and I will finally share the throne.
Unless you'd rather see Oz and Glinda there.
Sister, you lied to me.
It's nice, isn't it?
How clear everything becomes.
What is happening to me?
It's just your heart withering away.
Fear not, Theodora... for soon you will feel nothing at all except... beautiful wickedness.
Sister?
Sister, you're hideous.
I can cast a simple enchantment... and have you looking just the way you were before.
I want him to see me like this.
I want him to know that he was the one who made me this way.
It's imperative that you behave like the great leader that they think you are.
Morale is essential if we have any hope of defeating Evanora.
You have a plan.
You're going to lead us into battle and take back the throne.
And do we have an army to help do this?
Of sorts.
The Quadlings, Your Highness.
You're soldiers?
Oh, you can hoe.
It might.
And these are the Tinkers.
Are you kidding me?
We're tougher than we look, Wizard.
What they lack in stamina, the Tinkers make up for in ingenuity.
They can build anything.
And we're prepared to storm the Emerald City.
If you don't keel over on the way there.
And, finally, the Munchkins.
All right, that's enough!
Munchkins, stop!
Guys, take five.
Glinda, these are all very lovely people.
But do you honestly believe... that they can kill a wicked witch and an army of flying baboons?
You want me to lead an army that can't kill?
If this was easy, we wouldn't need a wizard, would we?
Something's wrong!
It looks like she's managing.
Still think your Wizard can save you from the likes of me?
Speak up, or I will tear out your tongue!
Now, who is that?
May I have this dance?
Theodora, stop.
You're hurting him.
Theodora, what happened to you?
You happened to me.
I'd hoped you'd be able to see through her.
She only killed a man, not what he believed in.
Begone, Witch, before the Wizard makes mush of you!
How sweet.
You all believe in him.
Well, so did I, once.
And as for you... my pretty one.
When I return with my sister and her army... the Yellow Brick Road will be red with the blood... of every Tinker, farmer and Munchkin in your kingdom.
You underestimate us, Theodora.
We are a strong and united people.
And now the Wizard is here to lead us.
And as for your Wizard... he will be the first to die.
And you will all see that he is nothing but a deceitful... selfish and extremely mortal man.
Now that the Wizard is with us...
Wizard?
Leaving?
An army and yet another wicked witch?
This one bent on destroying everyone, especially me?
So, you're not the wizard I was expecting.
So, you don't have the powers I thought you'd have.
Glinda, I wish I had the answer.
But I'm just a con man.
I'm a carnival magician.
I'm just not the man you want me to be.
Someone needs to tuck me in.
My papa used to do it.
I see.
Perhaps you'd prefer the Wizard, then?
Yes, ma'am.
Do you grant wishes?
Do I what?
Grant wishes.
The old wizard could grant wishes.
People would travel to the Emerald City and ask him for things.
That's what I thought.
You see, where I come from, there aren't any real wizards.
Although, there is one.
Thomas Alva Edison.
The Wizard of Menlo Park.
A truly great man.
With almost nothing, he made the impossible real.
Is that the kind of wizard you are?
It's the kind of wizard I'd like to be.
I'd rather you grant wishes, but that's a good wizard, too.
Goodnight, Wizard.
- What is this?
It's all in there.
Illusion, misdirect, sleight of hand.
A terrible cheat?
The best there is.
The carnival magician's going to put on a show.
Magic, mystery, prestidigitation!
It'll be my greatest trick yet.
Where I come from, this is called a praxinoscope.
Although, I've made a few modifications.
It allows you to project an image into space.
Impossible.
And we're not exactly a terrifying army when we're awake.
Or maybe not.
In the conjuring business, flash is always good.
Gives the audience a little "wow".
You gentlemen will be combining sulphur rock, nitrate of pot ash... and charcoal to create what is commonly known... as black powder.
Looks good.
My very own Winkie Guards... soon you will be facing Glinda and her army of weaklings.
We shall show them no mercy!
Now, I've added this adjustable lens to your design... along with a few other things.
Do you know how to build a hot air balloon?
This is all very impressive... but you still haven't told me how you plan to get this thing into the Emerald City.
What do you mean you know someone?
Hello, Wizard.
For protection.
Not that you need it.
We are few... but we are mighty!
Quadlings.
We face great odds, but we are armed with our courage... our hard work and most of all... our faith in one another.
We have nothing to fear as long as we believe.
For when we do believe... anything is possible!
Onward!
We bring supplies for battle.
I was told of no such delivery.
What's this?
They dare march on us?
Curse you!
The fog is lifting!
Quadlings, fall back.
Away with her.
Glinda did very well for herself today, I'll admit.
What should I do now?
I'm going to wipe out your light... until there is nothing left but my darkness.
I have been waiting for this for a long time.
He said it was going to be his greatest trick yet.
Did he tell you the trick was on us?
How predictable.
I knew that buffoon of yours couldn't be the Wizard.
Out of my way!
Because I believe in the Wizard.
Where is he going?
Not so great and powerful after all.
That was just the opening act.
Let this be the final word.
Your prophecy is dead.
Farewell.
Say hello to your daddy for me.
The dreams of the people live on.
No one defies Oz!
I'm now more powerful than ever.
I'm invincible!
Do you still doubt me?
Doubt you?
Use this.
This can't be.
You cannot defeat me.
I'm immortal!
I am the great and powerful Wizard of Oz!
Now witness and observe... as I unleash the stars!
Behold!
So, those are fireworks.
He is the Wizard.
Never!
Not so fast.
You and I aren't finished yet.
You have the throne, Glinda.
What more could you want?
You can't give me that.
You took what mattered most to me.
Of course, Glinda.
I think at the very least, they deserve that.
What's the matter, Glinda?
What have you done?
Look what you've done to me!
Now everyone will see you as you truly are.
In the name of my father, I banish you from the Emerald City... never to return.
I'm trying.
Is it on?
Well done, Tinker.
Your machine works beautifully.
That's just workmanship.
What you displayed was real courage.
Your father would have been more than proud.
He would have marvelled at the woman you've become.
Now we're ready in case anyone wants to speak with the Wizard.
When those witches come back, and they will come back... we're going to need everyone to believe.
May it assist you in the reconstruction of the Emerald City.
I will cherish this forever.
Thank you for your faith in me.
And now for Sourpuss.
Something that, where I come from, can turn the saddest day... into a happy one.
- I don't want that.
- I cannot.
Thank you.
Finley, you stood by my side... when any monkey in his right mind would have flown away.
To you, I give something that I've never given to anyone.
My friendship.
That's all I ever really wanted.
I'm afraid I can't give you what I know you want most of all.
All I can offer you is this.
It's perfect.
You better have something for Glinda.
But of course.
I've saved the best for last.
For you... a sight envied by all and seen by none.
You'll be astounded by what you find behind the curtain.
And what do you see?
That I have everything I ever wanted.
For the record, I knew you had it in you all along.
Goodness.
Now, Knuck.
Fifty years ago, an alien force known as the Formics attacked Earth.
Tens of millions died.
We've been preparing for them to come back ever since.
That's what you said about his brother.
You miscalculated your trajectory relative to the incoming asteroid.
Play again.
Which makes him even smarter.
Well, let's see how he handles rejection.
Lie down.
The sooner we get this done, the sooner you can move on.
Ready?
This won't hurt a bit.
Where do you think you're going, Wiggin?
Washed out, huh?
Come on!
Take it easy, Ender!
Nothing like who?
Now I'm just like you.
Deep space intel shows us that the number of enemy ships already deployed is 10 times those we faced during the first invasion.
The Formics are rebuilding and strengthening their fleet.
We must conquer or die.
We must never again bear witness to the slaughter of tens of millions of innocent people, as we did during the Formic invasion.
If you want, I'll go away, so you don't have to be embarrassed.
Ender, no one is embarrassed.
John, please say something.
It's a tough program, Ender.
Knocking him down was the first fight.
I wanted to win all the next ones too.
So they'd leave me alone.
But you took away my monitor.
The final step in our evaluation is always to see what happens when the monitor's removed.
Ender, you don't have to do this.
Ender and I should have a private conversation.
Mazer Rackham.
We need minds like yours, Ender.
Young people integrate complex data more easily than adults.
Privacy rights restored.
It's what I was born for, right?
Valentine was too compassionate for Battle School.
My brother Peter washed out because he was too quick to violence.
Colonel Graff said I need to find a balance between those emotions if I were to succeed.
I'm Ender.
You all right?
What are you doin', Wiggin?
Yes, it is.
Sir, you made them hate me.
Caesar was assassinated by the people he trusted.
And Napoleon lost in the end.
Not before he conquered the known world.
He has a complicated response to authority.
He wants to please the overbearing father figure, but resents a lack of reciprocated affection.
At ease.
That must never be allowed to happen again.
Let the courage of Mazer Rackham be your inspiration.
Wakey, wakey, rise and shine!
Do not attempt to fire the weapon!
At ease.
Step through that gate and you're in a zero-G environment.
Nicely done!
Well, that's harmless.
What do you think it does when it hits the suit?
You're flapping' around like a bunch of drunken ducks!
You will train to compete as a team against other teams.
- Wiggin!
So, I may have the opportunity to promote some of you.
It's just that none of us have received any replies from home.
I thought our privacy rights had been restored, sir.
You have the right to privately think whatever you wish, Wiggin.
But there's too much at stake to allow your unfiltered thoughts to leave this facility.
Yes, sir.
Keep it up, snot, and you will never make it to Command School.
Get up!
You do not speak unless spoken to!
Am I clear?
Now go to sleep!
We have only three passing scores on the deep space navigation test.
Ender, get down here and explain.
Ma'am, I think Bean or Alai have a better handle on this than I do.
Go on, Alai.
Of course, there's a moon we have to pass here and that complicates things.
Welcome to Games and Recreation.
Cerebral control enabled.
Choose right and you'll go to Fairyland.
Bad luck.
- Try again, little mouse.
The way he plays a game reveals his state of mind.
Well, before we make him a leader, let's see how he deals with frustration.
What you doin'?
Playing a stupid game.
- Which you gonna choose?
Come on, little mouse, come on.
That's what they want from us.
I've never seen anyone do that.
What are they doing?
They're promoting you.
Peace to you.
You lost, Launchie?
Mama Petra, she talking!
I ask for a replacement for O'Reilly and this is what I get?
A useless, skinny, untrained snot!
I intend to trade you ASAP.
My army is undefeated in the last 21 battles.
I'm on track to make it to Command School within six months.
So, I am to do nothing?
During free time, I could show you some moves.
You ready?
In three, two, one...
At least you don't have any bad habits.
I don't have any good ones either.
I'll give you those.
Fire.
Evenlongen
Now you're gettin' it!
That was fun.
- Where were you?
- Practicing.
In fact, you don't practice at all!
May I speak to you privately, sir?
Are you threatening me, snot?
No.
You'd better watch your back, Wiggin.
What's the play?
We gotta break them up.
In three, two, one...
They've got half their toon back near their gate.
In three, two, one...
Smart move, holding Wiggin back.
At ease.
Stop it, Bonzo!
Try making me look like a fool again and I'll kill you.
Are you okay?
What do you want me to do?
Valentine?
How can you be in my game?
Nightmares, Launchie?
Keep 'em to yourself.
You said the game would reveal his state of mind, not screw with it!
How did his psycho brother end up in the game?
I find it hard to respect someone just because they outrank me, sir.
We discontinued the name four years ago.
No Dragon Army ever won a battle.
Then why not a new name, sir?
Because we already have the uniforms.
And who will be in this army, sir?
Your new quarters.
Do you think they'll follow me?
At ease.
Welcome to Dragon Army.
Bunking will be arranged with youngest at the front and veterans at the back.
Ender every other commander has their seniors closest to the door.
Well, I don't intend to be like every other commander.
What am I doing here, Ender?
- No, sir!
Command School is pressing for a decision.
Tell them we need more time.
We're out of time.
Yes, sir.
The Colonel is changing the rules!
You all right?
I twisted my ankle.
- How bad?
They already opened the gate?
Petra?
Look out!
Twelve clear on the wall!
Now!
Pull!
We still outnumber him.
We can't lose.
Open fire!
They're drifting upwards!
Still think he's not ready?
I could break your arm!
Help!
We need help in here!
Everybody knows he started it.
Leave us.
You too, cadet.
He's gonna die, isn't he?
Please, don't lie to me.
The Fleet owns you, Ender.
Strategos would never allow it.
Send me home, Colonel, or I will resign.
I'm not so sure.
I won't play this game anymore.
I quit.
You wanted to see me.
It used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15.
When the war is over, we can have the luxury of debating the morality of what we do.
When it's over, what will be left of the boy?
What does it matter if there's nothing left at all?
Thanks for what you've done.
- Where's Ender?
- Hello, Valentine.
Ender, he attacked first.
And I fought back, just like Peter taught me.
I've had a lot of fights, Val.
I've won because I've always understood the way my enemy thinks.
Ender, they want me to talk you into going back.
I told them I won't cooperate.
I don't think you're hiding here just because you care about Bonzo.
You can't hide here forever.
But if you stay here, if you don't try, then we will all be lost.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
I need to know that you will not block my e-mails again.
Attention, prepare for transporter docking operation.
Much further.
"I wish there was another way, but war seems inevitable."
Not very hospitable, is it?
We took it from the Formics 27 years after Rackham's victory.
We built our base here to be closer to their home planet, to allow instantaneous communication by Ansible with our attack fleet.
For the same reason that you kept kicking that bully before I recruited you.
The purpose of this war is to prevent all future wars.
Your training begins first thing tomorrow morning.
Sergeant Dap will show you to your quarters.
In the event of an evacuation, two breaths every minute from one of these will compensate for lower levels of surface oxygen.
Lights out in five.
Who are you?
Look, this may be amusing to you, but they'll come looking for me.
I'll just sit this one out.
I thought you were a teacher.
There is no teacher but the enemy.
Do you have a name?
Mazer Rackham.
Sir, I've been building models of your planes since I was six years old.
I have a question, sir.
On the vids, they always cut out right after you destroy the one carrier.
Why?
Get dressed.
Just watch.
After the explosion cleared, everything was incredibly still.
Their ships just stopped shooting.
And then they started falling out of the sky.
There.
Play back, please.
To what animals are the Formics most often compared?
What she thinks, they do.
You mean, why is it marked?
Sir, have you ever seen a queen?
- Ho, Commander!
- Good to see you, sir.
At ease.
While you've been skinny-dipping, the Colonel's been flogging us to death on the simulator!
Let's bring your commander up to speed.
Our latest probe images will give you an idea of what's happening on the enemy planet.
What's most alarming is the rate at which their military power is expanding.
They're planning to colonize another planet before they breed themselves into extinction.
Our orders are to defeat them before they pose an irreversible threat.
We will begin with photo real simulations to best approximate real battles.
You will command overall strategy.
Your toon leaders will each command a battle group.
That's the beauty of the little Doctor.
But I'll only get one shot.
Once the Formics see how she works, they won't clump together again.
You will have to win this war one battle at a time.
Once our battle fleet is detected entering the Formic solar system, we will have no alternative but to engage.
I trust we have chosen our commander well.
Absolutely.
Goodnight, sir.
Harvesting water.
Open fire!
Dink, compensate for the pull of planet G8 and go full throttle!
Do Sierra now!
Bernard, watch your speed!
Dink, you are closing too fast!
Sir, I can't win if I don't take any risks.
There's no time to train anyone else.
Son, tomorrow Colonel Raokham will run your final simulation.
You will be ready to face the real enemy.
And you will be the finest commander we've ever trained.
One more simulation and I may have to go to war.
Ender, this is not a conversation we should be having at 1:00 a.m.
What if they could "think" to one another?
We're gonna get crushed.
He's not ready.
Good luck, sir.
Attention!
Commander Wiggin, the Strategos is here today to witness your final simulation.
If you are successful, he will endorse your promotion to Battle Commander of the entire fleet.
I don't think Mazer intends for us to find a diplomatic solution.
What's he waiting for?
Just give him a minute.
Ender, what do we do?
Clumped enough for you now, Petra?
Fire now!
Give me false color.
We're not done yet.
Copy that.
Ender, you're gonna leave our transporters defenseless!
Ninety seconds, Ender!
Ender, my targeting sensor needs a clear line of sight!
Ender, we're entering their atmosphere!
Thirty seconds!
I still don't have a clear shot.
We will drill a hole through this swarm!
Shield integrity's at 5%!
How about that?
Game over.
What's he saying?
Restoring Ansible connection.
What is this?
Why are we watching these images?
What do you mean, "we won"?
There was no other way.
With this victory, you've won all future battles.
I abandoned them in order to win!
I will be remembered as a killer!
It was us or them.
And you're sure we've killed every last one of them?
The way we win matters.
Don't hurt him.
May I stay with him?
Yes, of course.
What if they could talk to us?
What were they thinking?
Valentine!
What if we could "think" to them?
What are you doing, Ender?
Warning, you are leaving an oxygen-balanced environment.
The Formics accessed the game through me.
"They came from her."
"She was always trying to communicate with me."
You're dying.
Is it a queen?
"I need to find out if I'm as gifted at peace as I am at war."
Hold on there, just a second.
Where are you headed, there?
Where are you headed up to?
There he is.
Thank you.
Well, there's the man of the hour.
The what?
The man of the hour.
So, you told the sheriff that you were walking to Nebraska?
What million dollars?
Let me see that.
And your mother won't take me.
"Mega Sweepstakes Marketing."
I didn't even know they still did it anymore.
Well, they can't say it if it's not true.
They're just trying to sell you magazines.
It says I won.
I'm not trusting the mail with a million dollars.
Just cool your jets.
This is the second time he's tried to sneak out.
I never knew the son of a bitch even wanted to be a millionaire.
He should have thought about that years ago and worked for it.
What would you do with a million dollars anyway, Dad?
Buy a new truck.
Tell me when you do, so I can stay off the road.
I need an air compressor, too.
Are you still harping on that?
Ed Pegram still has mine.
That's because he's a thief.
A guy I knew back in Hawthorne.
And when did he borrow it?
'74.
I'd say he stole it.
That's why I need a new one.
Where are you off to now?
Sitting down.
I didn't think he could memorize anything anymore.
Hey, what's with this casserole?
But that's not to say that I can't set you up with a whole lot more reasonable speakers that'll still blow your mind if you're worried that the Wilsons or Paradigms are going to set you back too much.
"Janice." Sorry.
Where did they find him this time?
Way the hell out on King Avenue by the Albertsons.
I can't take it anymore.
Ross is in there, trying to talk some sense into him.
What's going on, Dad?
Ask Ma and Ross.
They seem to know it all.
I'm asking you.
Can't get her to turn over.
That's because ifs been sitting there for 10 years.
Oh, I'll get it running.
He still thinks he's going to Lincoln to get his money.
I cut the solenoid wire and stuck it back in so that'll slow him down.
Yeah, and it's pathetic.
Seems like drinking always gave him more than enough to live for until now.
Mom and I are looking at reality, and you'd better start, too.
It's your first time in the chair, right?
Yeah, Kelly Ann Castillo called in sick, so they let me fill in.
And apparently I didn't stink the place up too bad, so...
I don't know about "Tom Brokaw" exactly, but, yeah, ifs looking pretty good.
Are you moving back in?
You want to come in?
You know what it means.
I want you to move back in.
But I just moved out.
Are we still having sex?
I've got to go.
I'm going to put him in a...
Dad.
Dad!
Leave me alone.
Come on, let me take you home.
I'm going to Lincoln if it's the last thing I do.
I'm running out of time.
You don't even have a suitcase.
I'm not staying there.
I'm your son.
Well, then why don't you take me?
Have you lost your marbles, too?
Get your father out of your car this goddamned instant.
You need to help me.
I'm the one who does all the work around here.
You always complain about having him around.
What about your job?
Well, I told them I was sick.
Sick in the head.
I can drive a hell of a lot better than that moron.
All right, Dad.
I can drive a hell of a lot better than that moron.
Shit.
Jesus Christ, Dad, what are you doing here?
Let's go.
We don't have time for that.
It's just a bunch of rocks.
So, what do you think, Dad?
It doesn't look finished to me.
How do you mean?
Well, looks like somebody got bored doing it.
Washington's the only one with any clothes, and they're just kind of roughed in.
Lincoln doesn't even have an ear.
Okay, we've seen it.
Dad?
I'm fine.
Go back to bed.
Give me a second.
Where's my teeth?
You lost your teeth?
The tavern?
I wasn't in no tavern.
Did you leave them at the place where they serve alcohol that you don't call a tavern?
Must have been when I fell by the tracks.
Gentlemen, thank you for your patience.
I don't drink.
You hear that, Dad?
We won't be making Lincoln by Friday.
We have until Monday.
We're going to take you back home.
I'm not going home.
Selling record players.
I won a million dollars.
Hey, I looked, but I couldn't find your teeth anywhere.
They're by the tracks.
Listen, Mom talked to Uncle Ray and Aunt Martha, and they're going to put us up in Hawthorne over the weekend.
I don't want to go to Hawthorne.
There's no sense going to Lincoln over the weekend.
I will get you there Monday morning.
Anyway, Aunt Martha said she'd invite all your brothers over and have a little get-together on Sunday.
I don't want to go to Hawthorne.
Here it is!
These ain't mine.
They have to be.
I ought to know my own teeth.
Of course they're my teeth.
Don't be a moron.
Well, hello there, boys!
Look at you, Davey.
You couldn't have been more than 15 the last time you were here.
Well, what do you got to say for yourself, Woody?
Nothing.
Look who I found hanging around out front, Ray.
Your little brother, Woody.
What's up, Woody?
Nothing.
How about you?
Not much.
Hi, Uncle Ray.
You have a latrine?
Uh, around the corner, to your left.
You boys remember your cousin David?
It's been a long time since we all met as kids.
What are you guys up to?
Not much.
This economy has just tore up Hawthorne, Davey.
Things are hard for young men.
Cole, here, did some jail.
Don't bring that up.
Bitch lied through her teeth.
I will not have that language in my house.
Sorry, Mom.
I made sandwiches.
But how long, total?
It's probably about, uh, 750 miles.
It took you two days to drive 750 miles?
What were you driving, a dump truck or something?
That's, like, over 100 miles an hour.
Oh, Bart was moving.
Shit, two days from Montana.
Son of a bitch must have been driving in reverse.
Did you get that, Dad?
Uncle Ray's foot hurts.
I know.
Everything else good, though?
Uncle Ray?
Not really.
Well, good for him.
He always was a go-getter, wasn't he?
Two goddamn days from Billings!
Ed Pegram?
Yeah, I thought he owned it.
Sold it to him.
For how much?
- You need something?
What you fellows got going on, here?
Oh, we're just replacing a transmission cooler line.
We don't know him.
Hey, bud.
Let's see if I know anyone in here.
It's pretty quiet in here.
Okay, what kind of beer would you like?
I'll have a Mountain Dew.
Bud's good.
Bud and a Dew, coming up.
Tom Varnik still own this place?
I don't remember that name.
It must have been before my time.
Here we go, guys.
Anything else I can get for you right now?
No, ma'am.
Okay, holler if you need something.
I used to know everyone in here.
So, I guess you kept up that fine family tradition with Ross and me.
You liked it, as I recall.
I was, like, six.
A sip of beer ain't going to kill you when you're six years old.
I thought you drank.
I've been trying to give it up.
What for?
And now you're all right.
Can I have a beer, too, please?
You betcha.
I'm going to drink with my dad.
I didn't tell you that Noel and I broke up.
Who?
Noel.
The girl I've been living with for the past two years.
How are you supposed to know when you're sure?
How did you and Mom end up getting married?
Oh, she wanted to.
And you didn't?
I figured, what the hell.
Could have been worse.
Never came up.
Nope.
Then why did you have us?
So, you and Mom never actually talked about whether you wanted kids or not?
I figured if we kept on screwing, we would end up with a couple of you.
Did you ever think about leaving her?
Oh, I would just end up with somebody else who would give me shit all the time.
I don't drink that much.
Oh, what do you mean, "bullshit"?
I knew you had a problem when I was eight.
You cost me a lot of money.
Yeah, I poured it out because I was sick of seeing you drunk all the time.
And I got a right to do whatever the goddamn hell I want.
So, I guess you do drink.
- A little bit.
God damn it, so what?
You do what you want to do, and so do I.
You would drink, too, if you were married to your mother.
And it ain't your job to tell me what to do, you little cocksucker.
Should I take you back to Ray and Martha's?
I don't know.
Say, don't you owe me a couple of bucks?
Christ Almighty, it's Woody Grant.
God, I never thought I'd see you back in Hawthorne.
So, how you been?
Hi, I'm David, Woody's son.
Ed Pegram?
How you doing, guy?
You know, the last time I saw you, you was just a little shaver.
I used to give you candy bars down at the garage when you were about this high.
Thank you.
And apparently, my dad used to give you air compressors.
How's that?
Nothing.
Hey, Dad, I'm going to the bathroom.
What brings you down here?
I'm just passing through.
Goddamn, Woody Grant is a millionaire!
Who would have thought it, huh?
The next round is on Woody.
Did you see the look on those fellas, faces?
Well, good morning, boys.
Slept in a little late, did you?
Morning.
Davey, get yourself a chair from over there.
And Woody, you sit right on down here.
Woody, here, is the talk of the town.
Is that right?
Why didn't you tell us you was rich, Woody?
You could have told us the real reason you were coming through town.
We're just tickled for you.
You got it on you?
Yeah, we sure would like to see what a million dollars looks like.
We still got to go to Lincoln to get it.
Goddamn, you hit the Powerball!
Honestly, he didn't win anything.
I didn't win anything.
You have to watch out for buzzards, too.
Lincoln is over 200 miles.
We're real proud of you, Woody.
And I know Ma and Pa would've been real proud, too.
Hell, yeah, it must be nice.
Is it nice, Dad?
Is what nice?
Winning all that money?
Yeah, pretty nice.
Bernie Bowen, how you doing?
Pretty good.
That's what I hear.
Everybody's saying how Woody Grant's a millionaire.
Well, that's the most exciting news around here for ages!
It's no big deal.
Oh, the newspaper's gonna do a big write-up on you.
I'm gonna get my picture in the paper?
You bet you will.
Dad, here's the bus.
We're all real happy for you and real pleased you thought to stop back home and share the big news.
Thanks, Bernie.
Hey, watch your wallet!
Thank you.
You both look like hell.
I'm fine.
You're lucky you're not dead.
I haven't been drinking!
That's what you said on our first date!
Almost getting your father killed over some cockamamie pot of gold.
Mom, come here, please.
I mean, you and I both know that this is not about the money.
What's the harm in letting him have his little fantasy for just a couple more days?
You and Ross, always fretting over your father.
What about me?
What about taking me out to see my sister in Eau Claire?
Your father doesn't even know what the hell's going on around him half the time.
Do you, Woody?
Do I what?
Know what's going on around you?
You watch it, or that's what you're gonna turn into.
Now, take me out to the cemetery.
I want to pay my respects.
Martha said she'd have lunch ready.
Martha can wait.
Car's over there.
There's Woody's mother, Sara.
She hated me.
She wanted him to marry someone who would milk the cows.
The good Lord did not do Sara any favors in the looks department.
More a man's face than a woman's, really.
How did she die?
Saw herself in the mirror one day.
No.
Cancer!
And there's the old Swede, Tolf.
That farm just ruined him.
You're lucky I took you away from there.
And there's Woody's brother, David.
You were named after him.
He died of scarlet fever when he was only two.
Woody slept in the same bed with him and never got it.
There's Woody's little sister, Rose.
She was only 19 when she was killed in a car wreck near Wausa.
- I'm just telling you the truth.
She was screwing guys in the back of Hawthorne Creamery when she was only 15.
Catholics wouldn't be caught dead around all these damn Lutherans.
Here's Delmer, Woody's cousin.
He was a drunk.
One time, we were wrestling, and he felt me up.
Grabbed a handful of boob, and Woody was right there and didn't have a clue.
Well, my goodness.
I didn't know Keith White was here.
When did he die?
See what you could've had, Keith, if you hadn't talked about wheat all the lime?
That's what pig farming will do to you.
So, you got any other cars?
No, just that one.
What's the engine?
It's a four-cylinder.
Yeah, but what size?
Oh, I don't really know.
Ross has a Kia Rondo, and Marcie has a Nissan Pathfinder, because she carts the kids around a lot.
So, you all got Jap cars?
Actually, Kia is Korean.
Hey, is this where I can find Mr. Woody Grant?
Who wants to know?
Um, I was sent by Mrs. Nagy at the Hawthorne Republican to take his picture.
Yeah, he's here.
And they want him to be sure to drop by the office for an interview.
Yes.
Your father is certainly quite the celebrity around here.
That's what I came to tell you about.
Dad didn't win any lottery, or sweepstakes, or anything.
He's a little confused about something he got in the mail, and it's gotten way out of hand.
So, he didn't win a million dollars?
No, ma'am.
It just goes to show you, some things never change.
He was always a little confused.
It's ancient history now, and I don't want to speak out of turn, but Woody and I used to go together.
What happened?
Your mother is what happened.
How is Kate?
It's water under the bridge.
Don't get me wrong, I married a wonderful man.
We ran this newspaper together until he died.
Had three children, eight grandchildren.
I've got no complaints.
Was Woody drinking back then?
There's really not much else to do.
Nowadays, of course, ifs not just the booze, but all the other stuff.
For Woody, it got bad after Korea.
He had a hard time over there.
I thought he was just a mechanic.
He was, for the army planes.
But he was shot down, being transferred.
You knew that, right?
Thank you.
Wow, they look like kids.
Your dad was never much of a talker, and when he came back, he hardly said a word.
But always very kind.
People took advantage of him.
He just couldn't turn down a favor.
Now that everyone thinks he's a millionaire, he's a big hero around here.
Well, I'm sorry I can't print that he is, but I won't print that he isn't, either.
I'll just do a little story on him and Kate stopping through town.
It's hard to imagine you and my mother fighting over the same man.
I knew I didn't have a chance, anyway.
What are you having, old man?
Meatloaf.
You've been staring at that menu for 10 minutes.
Where does it say "meatloaf"?
They ought to have meatloaf.
Well, they don't, so pick something else.
Dad, do you know what you want?
Do you have meatloaf?
Chicken, then.
Do you want the fried chicken, or the flame-broiled chicken breast?
And for you, ma'am?
I was thinking about having the roast beef, but now I'm not sure.
No, I want the roast beef.
I'll have the tilapia.
Don't forget to help yourselves to the soup and salad bar.
That's Ed Pegram singing.
He always did have a nice voice.
It was the only nice thing about that bastard.
- He's all right.
These boys grow up staring at the rear ends of cows and pigs.
It's only natural that a real woman will get them chafing their pants.
Mom, please don't talk about that kind of stuff right before we eat.
You were always such a sensitive boy.
And such a beautiful boy.
Why, when you were a baby, people used to stop me on the street and tell me how beautiful you were.
A lot of them thought you were a girl.
Isn't that right, Woody?
I don't know.
We have a celebrity in our midst this evening.
Stand up and take a bow, Woody.
Just do it and get it over with.
Okay, you ham, that's enough.
Roslyn, you're going to be getting a big tip from that table tonight.
Hey, little Davey!
Hello, Mr. Pegram.
I was hoping I'd run into you.
What can I do for you?
Heart of gold.
And I wanted to show him some respect, so I loaned him a ton of dough, and I never saw it again.
So, you want your $800 back.
Woody owes me a lot more than that.
I'm sorry to break it to you, but my dad didn't win anything.
It's all a big misunderstanding.
You know Woody, you can understand that.
Right, so you're all headed down to Lincoln to visit the roller skating museum, huh?
Look, Davey, I really don't want to have to bring a lawyer into this.
Lawyer?
What's the statute of limitations on bullshit?
I'm a man with a real strong sense of right and wrong.
And if Woody hit it rich and I don't see any of it that would be wrong.
And I will make it right.
Are you threatening my family?
Hey, I'm the victim, here.
It's just food for thought.
You know beer, you just rent the stuff.
I just might.
You were such a beautiful little boy.
I just had an interesting conversation with Ed Pegram in the men's room.
What did he want?
Some of Dad's money.
I can loan him a couple bucks if he's hard up.
Like hell, you will.
Tomorrow.
Why not today?
The dead ones won't be here.
Years ago, before you were married.
It was a long time ago.
What are you bringing that up for?
It's community service, on account of Colds rape.
Sexual assault, not rape.
Well, what's the difference?
There's a big difference.
Cole can explain it better than I can.
Oh, that's nice!
A what?
I never had an Impala.
Well, hell, I don't know what it was, then.
I had a Buick.
That's what it was.
Are you still driving that?
I haven't had that for years.
I thought you still had it.
It was okay.
They don't make them like that anymore.
Those cars will run forever.
Whatever happened to it?
It stopped running.
Well, they'll do that.
How about Marcie and the kids?
Who's playing?
Chicago and Detroit.
How long did it take you to drive?
So, Uncle Woody, did you get over and talk to the newspaper yet?
I went by the office and gave them the lowdown.
What's it like being a millionaire, Woody?
It's okay.
Let's raise a glass to Kate and Woody, here.
Not to be a spoilsport, but you all know this is bull.
I mean, Dad didn't win anything.
Nice try, Ross.
Yeah, we're way beyond that.
Trying to keep it quiet, so everybody don't come around looking for a handout, huh, Kate?
That's good thinking.
No, that's right.
But come tomorrow, that's a different story.
What the hell are you gonna do with a compressor?
You boys will do no such thing.
Get yourselves shot for an old piece of garbage?
Am I the only sane one in this family?
Do you think it's still there?
Dad, want to take a drive later and see the old homestead?
The what?
David and I want to go see where you grew up.
What for?
What's Uncle Albert doing?
He's watching cars go by.
Remember when they came out to visit when we were kids, and he'd take a chair out in the front yard every evening to watch the road?
It sure is good to see you boys again.
It's great seeing you again, too.
What's that?
I've been hearing that a lot lately.
You know, Cole's and my folks would never say nothing if it was just for them, but they're gonna need in on this deal, too.
Are you saying you want money from us?
Oh, we just figured, seeing as how the family took care of Woody and all, and kept him on his feet.
Verne and I loaned Woody quite a bit, and it wasn't like we was rich.
But he was my brother-in-law, and we couldn't stand to see the family suffer.
This is a total sham.
You're a damn liar!
Don't feed us any of your bullshit, Ross.
You want to go?
Have you boys lost your minds?
Aunt Betty and her henchmen here are asking for reparations.
For what?
They're after Dad's "winnings." Right?
They say we owe them money.
What on Earth are you talking about, Betty?
Now, Kate, you know we helped you and Woody out when he was drinking up everything he earned.
You know as well as I do it was the other way around.
You were always having him work on your cars for free, getting free gas.
The money you gave him didn't come close to what you owed.
He couldn't say "no" to anybody, and it ruined him.
I think you're having a senior moment, here, Kate.
Just where do you think that money come from when you got a bee in your bonnet to move up to Billings and open up that salon?
From my folks when they croaked, that's where!
I don't believe the nerve of you people.
Usually a person has to die before the vultures start circling.
Don't you dare think about asking that poor man for money.
You listen real good.
You can all just go fuck yourselves!
Boys, get your dad.
What do you think, old man?
Looks about the same.
That's true.
This is about how your mother kept it.
His brothers helped.
I got it, I got it.
This was my room.
That's where Woody's brother David died.
Do you remember that, Dad?
I was there.
This was my parents' room.
I'd get whipped if they found me in here.
I guess nobody's gonna whip me now.
The barn is still standing.
Have you seen enough?
I suppose.
It's just a bunch of old wood and some weeds.
Did you ever want a farm like your dad?
I don't remember.
And it doesn't matter.
Oh, there's the O'Hara farm.
Oh, and there's Ed Pegram's place on the right.
What are you doing?
Let's do it.
We're right here.
What are you boys up to now?
Hey, Dad, don't you want to see if he still has your compressor?
Will you two knock off this foolishness?
Hey, Dad, you finally got your compressor back.
That's not my compressor.
Sure it is.
Mine didn't look anything like that.
It's an old compressor we found in Ed Pegram's barn.
That wasn't Ed's barn.
What are you talking about?
Right, the Westendorfs.
The Pegrams live closer to town.
Oh, I got confused.
Anything you want to say about the Westendorfs?
No, they're good folks.
They had some tough times.
Salt of the Earth, the Westendorfs.
They really didn't deserve what you boys did to them.
Dad, why didn't you tell us that wasn't Ed's house?
I didn't know what the hell you were doing.
Have you ever seen us steal machinery before?
Well, I never know what you boys are up to.
Well, why didn't you say it wasn't yours?
I thought you wanted it.
What do we want an old compressor for?
That's what I couldn't figure out.
Hi, George.
Hi, Jean.
Just fine.
We were passing by and thought we'd stop in.
Haven't been in Hawthorne for a long time.
Well, what are you doing in the back seat?
We were just resting back here until you showed up.
You want to come in for a visit?
Sorry, we just have time to say hi and get going.
Getting by.
That's right.
You still fixing hair out there, Kate?
No, I let that go.
Oh, you did.
Well, good to see you folks.
I'd better get up front and drive us back to town.
You were right, Mom.
What do you want to do now, bust into a silo and steal some corn?
- Let me drive.
- No, I'll drive.
What time do you figure we'll be shoving off in the morning?
I think 8:00 sounds about right.
You want another beer?
I suppose.
Hey there, Davey-boy, make some room.
How's it going, cowboy?
Well, it was going fine.
Well, enough of this chit-chat, ifs time to get down to business.
Woody, I tried to tell your boy that you wouldn't mind using some of your winnings to even the score with your old pal Ed.
Well, how much you need?
I don't got it yet.
Remember, I was the one that convinced you to stay with Kate.
Your dad wanted to get a divorce because he was screwing some half-breed down at the reservation.
He thought he was in love.
Ain't that right, Woody?
When was this, Dad?
You know, if I hadn't been around, you might not even be here.
Back then, divorce was a sin.
Nowadays, I guess it's okay.
God must have changed his mind or something.
Get the hell away from us.
I want that money.
Move.
Okay, little Davey.
Have it your way.
But, uh, this is the last time that old Eddie-boy is gonna play nice.
Dad, are you okay?
They took my letter.
Where is it?
Where's what?
Just give it back.
I don't know what you're talking about, buddy.
Cole, do you know?
Of course not.
Where is it?
We don't got it.
Shut the fuck up, Cole!
We tossed it when we saw how bogus it was.
A millionaire?
I won't mention any of this to Mom or Ross.
We'll just tell them that you came to your senses, and we'll head back home.
Sound good?
Maybe they dropped it.
Should we go have a look?
I think it was easier to find your teeth.
Let's take a break.
Now, just imagine what you could do with one million dollars, Woodrow.
Somebody found your precious sweepstakes notice out on the street.
Dad, what's the matter?
No, we're not going to Lincoln.
Your head is busted open, and now you can barely stand up.
You promised.
And we're not driving down to Lincoln over a stupid fantasy!
It's my own damn fault for taking you this far.
What's the point?
I want a new truck.
Why do you need a truck so bad?
Well, what about the rest of the money?
You don't need a million dollars for a damn pickup truck.
It's for you boys.
I wanted to leave you something.
I just wanted to leave you something.
You know if there was any chance you won, I'd take you.
You know that, right?
I wouldn't lie to you.
I know.
Look, the only reason I agreed to take you to Lincoln was to get out of Billings for a while, and maybe have some time with you.
And to get you to shut up.
All right.
All right, what?
I'll shut up.
And what about Lincoln?
We don't have to go.
And I'm gonna have to listen to him harp about losing his fortune for the rest of his life.
Or my life.
He's gonna bury me at this rate.
You big idiot.
Dad?
Come on, you have to get your robe off.
Dad, give me the letter.
I'm sorry, your number wasn't one of the winning numbers.
Looks like you didn't win.
But it says I won.
It says you won if your number is one of the winning numbers.
I'm sorry, sir.
I hope you guys didn't have to come too far.
Well, Dad, I guess that's it.
I can give you a free gift, like a hat or a seat cushion.
Do you want a hat or a seat cushion?
A hat.
He'll take the hat.
Usually older people like your father.
Does he have Alzheimer's?
Thank you.
I'm here.
We're going back to Billings, okay?
I don't understand what's happening with your car.
Well, they made me a real good offer for it.
It's not much of a car.
Yeah, this truck is a real step up.
My name is on the title, you say?
Yeah, but you're gonna have to let me drive it.
You work out something with the prize people?
Yeah.
They were willing to go as far as the truck.
Come on, get in.
Okay, Dad, it's your turn to drive.
You said I couldn't.
Get down.
Looking good!
So long, Albert.
So long, Woody.
Let me assert my firm belief... that the only thing we have to fear... is fear itself.
Let me talk to Rosenbach.
No, I don't want to have to scroll down for the Task Force 373 story.
Yes, Bill, thanks very much for not giving a shit.
Go.
I know much has been written... as a result of the substantial leak of documents from Afghanistan.
It's Daniel.
Shit.
Have you seen this?
They're pouring out of every printer in the office.
I guess someone's pissed you made New Year's Eve a work day.
Well, as our resident computer genius... could you please find out who that someone is?
Whoever it was disguised his IP address.
According to this, the print jobs are coming from... your computer.
Charlie in maintenance said you left this by the scanner.
We didn't get anything from Wikileakers.
They've been doing crazy shit in Kenya.
The least you could do is put us on your program.
The small conference rooms are all booked.
Okay, you can have that for half an hour.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem.
Daniel...
Oh, by the way, that report we leaked... shifted voting 10% in the presidential election.
You might want to mention that when you introduce me.
Sure.
I'll pay for the cord if you actually get it to work.
I'm a mathematician by training.
I became interested in information...
The beginning of any conspiracy and of all corruption.
Whistleblowers are afraid to come forward because they fear retribution.
But what if we could remove that fear?
Today's hackers take it for granted, but they surf the Internet... because of the programs we created to hide data... to... to hide our identities.
Even then, I knew this technology... could hold the key to a whole new form of social justice.
Hundreds of volunteers work on the documents we are sent.
But we've honed our technology... to a point that even I don't know the identity of our sources.
And if the whistleblower's identity is secret... then he has nothing to fear.
Believe me, no one is interested in your secrets.
Yours, on the other hand...
One convert at a time.
By the way, I can soup up the graphics if you want.
What's wrong with the ones I've got?
Capable generous men, men of purpose.
Hurry up, Daniel.
A government destroyed by tyranny... rebuilt under a glass dome so the whole world could look in.
There's an ideal to aspire to.
Just look at it, Daniel.
My father took me to the dome when they first built it.
Yeah, well, when I was 13, my mum started dating this guy... from a nasty Australian cult called The Family.
They believed in blue auras and cleansing souls... and the strict discipline of children.
Severe beatings... starvation diets... regular closings of psychiatric drugs.
That's terrifying.
Why do you think my hair is white?
Cool.
You can trust me.
Yes, and quiet.
There's a new leak on the submission platform.
I don't know.
Jay Lim and the volunteers in Switzerland will analyze the docs... but I need you to verify that they're real.
No, but... you're just giving me the docs?
You said I could trust you.
You can.
What division is this?
I was actually looking for Ms. Leisal Grop.
Ms. Grop is down the hall in Client Services.
Can I transfer you?
What are you doing in here?
You're playing World of Warcraft aren't you?
We're investigating corruption in a Swiss Bank.
Of course.
Well, then I guess I can cover for you.
I worked for these assholes for years... before I understood the extent of the deception.
It's a massive tax dodge.
Last year, those diagrams... cheated your country alone out of 30 billion in tax revenues.
They have hundreds of clients from New York to Moscow... who will go to great lengths to hold on to their money.
We understand the risks.
You're damn right.
The bank has a huge network.
Right, I'm sure.
Hey, Julian, let's go.
How fast can you get Bellman a summary?
I'll stay up until it's done.
I'm sorry, I just got an odd call from the tech department.
I sent you the link.
They say there's a report on this website.
Sorry, I didn't want to wake you up.
It's okay.
I thought the Americans put free speech up there with mom and apple pie.
So did we.
Julian wants to meet right away.
And Solzhenitsyn didn't even have Twitter.
I mean, whoever thought that we'd need extra servers... to fight censorship attacks from the bastion of free speech.
Let's have a look.
Twenty-first century churnalism at its finest.
Is this how you're chatting up the totty in your golden years?
Well, I certainly can't impress them... with some of the stories rattling around the mainstream media echo chamber.
The women I meet are smart enough to know what they're missing out on.
I assume you're gonna tell us what that is?
I'll leave that to Mr. Assange and his merry band of programmers.
We have to help them, Alan.
Actual justice for those assholes.
That's great.
The judge must have lifted the injunction.
Look, we're back online.
We took down a billion-dollar bank.
This was a team effort.
We should get on Skype or something.
Okay, it's probably time that you met everyone face-to-face.
I don't get it.
It says I called...
Are you Jay Lim?
That's not the same thing.
Two freaks with a single server?
We only have one sewer?
Hmm, not as far as the outside world is concerned, no.
Look, Castro started a revolution with 82 men.
It does not matter how small you are... as long as you have faith and a plan of action.
If Julius Bar knew that they were up against an army of two...
Why have you been using an alias, then?
Come on, Daniel.
It's a hack, an inelegant solution.
It could've been so simple.
Where the hell is it?
Open it.
There were three of us.
Three boys with cartoon names, off on a series of harmless adventures.
I remember waiting for that verdict in this little room... and pacing backwards and forwards in a figure eight like a demented bee.
For real, why my hair turned white.
It's gobsmacking, isn't it?
We're trying to expose what the members have to go through.
Um, there are memos on the introspection rundowns, uh... forced isolation, you know, regulation of meals...
The hallowed Guardian, gracing us with their presence.
Look, a young Woodward and Bernstein.
Excuse me.
I should be working for him.
At the rate they're sacking journalists, you might not have a choice.
It sounds like you're trying to put us out of business.
And people buy our papers for something a little more discerning.
People are still buying your paper?
Looks like it's a bit twitchy.
Yeah, well, getting 10,000 hits an hour can do that to you.
There ain't no money in it.
I've got a few thousand Euros saved up.
That's a half-dozen machines on eBay.
What?
Are we not inspired, men of purpose?
Okay, uh, just hook it up right there, next to the other old IBMs.
And do me a favor, take off all the tags... because I don't want to know which one it is.
I'm just basically following the tradition of some excellent hackers.
You hacked the U.S. Defense Network?
It, uh, was a long time ago.
Lots of backdoors, it really wasn't that difficult.
And your, uh, robust infrastructure.
Do you milk those yourself or get other people to do it for you?
And starving.
The British press is going nuts over the National Party member list.
And we're getting more leaks.
Toxic dumping in the Ivory Coast, corruption in Kosovo.
It's just a bit cold, but...
Yes, it's been sitting there for an hour.
Phone numbers, home addresses.
Editing reflects bias.
Our sources, the people on the site, they trust us... because we don't screw with the documents.
I couldn't care less about Friday.
Maybe that's exactly what you need.
Hey, I was the one who told you to quit your job.
Have you got any of that disgusting energy drink?
Listen, we've been working on this project for months.
Julian thinks it could be the most important leak we've ever had.
He's got nowhere else to stay.
I have a son in Melbourne, you know.
He turns 19 next week.
I haven't seen him in a year.
It requires sacrifice.
- What's his name?
- Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
She's a Member of Parliament?
Apparently, our latest spokesperson.
...for the legislative process of bringing freedom of information... expression and speech, into the 21 st century.
Come on, Daniel!
What is this guy talking about?
The Students' Union are planning a protest at the university next week.
Excuse me.
She's certainly working an angle.
We're not breaking through.
If we had publicized the report better... then... they would have been heroes.
And there would be too high a political cost to murdering them.
Yeah, well, why don't you just leave that to me?
You should be, too.
Our operating system is secure, our other sources are safe, we're fine.
Do you think our site is vulnerable?
I think you're taking on presidents, kings, kingpins.
People that can easily afford the kind of black hats... that get off on breaking into a "secure" operating system.
And believe me, if your OS is anything less than secure... it's not gonna take them long to identify the rest of the sources... and to hunt them down.
Ask for my help, Daniel.
The President is busting my nuts about this UN speech.
Turn on CNN.
These are the guys that skewered Palin?
Right, we just indicted the bankers.
Do they have an agenda?
Truth, justice, the American way.
Sam, it's half a million text messages.
Who has the capacity to track that many pager services?
You think the leak came from us?
Why are you guys at State always so trigger-happy?
The program code is a mess.
You let him on the primary server?
We need help.
We need to be careful who we trust.
According to The Guardian, we had more scoops in three years... than The Washington Post has had in 30.
We have exposed corruption in dozens of countries.
It's working.
Please.
I grew up in the East.
I think, Mr. Assange... if we had someone like you... the Wall would have come down years before.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
This lady really defines the essence of what we're trying to achieve.
Privacy for the individual, transparency for institutions... with your personal safety as a whistleblower... guaranteed through anonymity.
Which is why we are continually adding qualified partners... to strengthen our team.
You can change the world with a great idea... but you can't do it alone.
Oh, we should buy some mistletoe to celebrate under.
We kept reading about you in the papers.
Can you join us for dinner?
I organized the competitions.
She means he was fat and slow.
By the way, have you seen these?
He's been keeping all the articles.
We don't really bother with the local papers.
It's a national paper.
All these books I'd spent years trying to discover on my own.
Perhaps you'd like to borrow one.
Where's the bathroom?
Over there.
He takes his backpack to the bathroom?
Bye!
What?
Oh, you haven't picked up on that?
Well, I suppose we all have our own unique way of viewing the world.
Including you.
But we could always do with more loyal followers.
There's been some effort to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention... but there is no way they will be able to destroy it all before the deadline.
His brother is out of favor... and this could be an attempt to cast himself as a possible successor to his father.
I'd just started my Fulbright, I'd had a bit to drink.
A lot to drink.
Your brother begged you to leave the drunk American at the party... but you stayed.
Someone had to keep an eye on her.
I want you to do what's best for your family.
Tripoli is my home.
I am doing what's best for my family.
Why don't we order something?
So, you think this is good intel, huh?
I've known Tarek for over 20 years.
I never thought you'd become a rock star.
I think rock stars have cooler tattoos.
You should have heard Julian.
"Compensating for something?"
And when newspapers get squeezed, it's the first thing to go... which is why providers of first-rate source material... like WikiLeaks, are so important.
Nick, is Assange ever gonna show?
I had a message, I think he's been delayed.
Passport control can be such a bore.
I was so frightened, I thought my hair might turn white.
The only way we could actually get back into the compound... was to ask the police, that we were trying to expose as being corrupt, to let us in.
So, what's this new leak you're sitting on?
Let's not attract attention.
That will give us plenty of time to find a way to slip you out of the hotel... and for you to show me what it is that's got their knickers in such a twist.
Christ, I'm surprised they don't have more men on you.
I thought you were in Norway.
It's not safe for me to stay here anymore.
That's a weapon.
The military said they died in a battle between U.S. forces and insurgents... and the press just bought it.
Didn't Reuters chase the story?
This is huge.
I want to call it "Collateral Murder."
In Baghdad?
Maybe you should look into flights.
We'll have to preprocess, improve resolution.
We can use FFmpegs and toss it into Final Cut.
I know some guys who've done this thing, at RUV.
Good.
Twenty, again.
It's probably why I lean so heavily on those around me.
Yeah.
You want to launch the biggest leak we've ever had in Iceland?
Let's take the fight to them.
The video shows the brutal slaughter of two Reuters reporters.
Here, we have firsthand evidence of the barbarity of war.
I've got the Deputy NSA for you.
Twelve million people have seen that video on YouTube.
Do you still want to tell me you think it's just a little website?
I'm on in five, do you have anything for me?
Well, these computer geeks are starting to become a real nuisance, Jim.
You must have enjoyed Keller's diatribe on your filthy white socks.
The video?
This is the guy who leaked the video?
She said it was more than that.
- Excuse me?
- Where's the Secretary?
- Jim's calling her now.
Do we know which documents Manning leaked?
He may have leaked the whole database.
That's a quarter of a million cables.
They can read like the diary of a 12-year-old.
Excuse me, but who gives a shit about diplomacy right now?
Sam, he's right.
A 22-year-old private with a history of mental instability... and a Lady Gaga CD... and we're on the verge of a major international crisis.
I'm adding another Tor circuit.
Wipe my portion from the hard drive.
The whole mission is to protect sources.
We can't protect them from themselves.
We're online.
See if Julian's on chat.
That is three gigs of text.
This is crazy.
Prick.
Come on.
Guys, look at this.
Nick, how can I help you?
Can you put me in touch with Julian?
Julian's not available.
Where's Julian flying in to?
Did anyone follow you?
No, no, no, I don't think so.
What's he doing here?
It's hundreds of thousands of pages of sensitive material.
So, we let the historians decide.
I thought the whole point of this organization was to publish in full.
Right now, the most powerful media machine on the entire planet... is planning a smear campaign like nothing you've ever seen.
Amazing how someone could talk for 10 minutes without actually saying anything.
You said you would hear him out.
What are you proposing?
An international media coalition legitimizing you as a news organization.
But they'd still get their exclusives.
But WikiLeaks doesn't edit.
That's all very well, but The Guardian can't be seen to condone... publishing something that puts lives in danger.
And morals aside, it's about how you're perceived.
Julian... this kind of coverage gets people's attention.
It could be the culmination of everything we've done.
This is a code to a temporary site.
I'll send you the link in 24 hours.
You'll find the war logs there.
So, it's a deal?
We publish, you publish.
We'll put out the war logs in six weeks.
If you behave, we'll move on to the cables.
Get me Bill Keller at The Times, and what's-his-fuck at Der Spiegel.
He's pretty slow for a tech wizard.
The spreadsheet is enormous.
I'm sure it contains the scoop of the century... but we simply cannot access it.
Are you working in Excel?
Every time I open the damn thing the system crashes.
You have to parse the data in a text editor... and then script it into a searchable database.
- Are you getting this?
It's "Escalation of Force."
Which I believe means more dead civilians.
You mean like every journalist who's ever covered the Pentagon?
They could indict us under that rubric.
I wouldn't be surprised if they do.
Nothing draws people to a cause like a celebrity martyr, Alan.
And this Task Force 373 has a hit list with more than 2,000 names.
Hold on.
He must be exhausted.
We're only posting a few hundred of the logs and we're swimming.
You'd need an army to go through all 91,000.
Thank God you have one.
The story on the generals would typically be the lead... but everything's going out at once in case there's a gag order.
We're struggling to keep it to 14 pages.
I've been trying to reach you for hours.
That was on my list.
It's 91,000 documents, and our site is publishing in four days.
Let's go.
What the hell were you thinking?
Fourteen pages in The Guardian, twelve in The New York Times.
This is more coverage than all the leaks we have had, combined.
We are winning an information war... which goes beyond any short-term alliance we have with the mainstream media... and you want to throw it all away because you fear... that some U.S. Government informant might come to harm?
These are human beings, Julian, and their lives are at stake.
What about the lives of the soldiers... and the civilians involved in these conflicts?
Death squads, unreported civilian casualties, countless incidents of friendly fire.
This is information the world needs to know.
Well, that's funny.
I don't remember you hiring me.
I don't recall a contract or a salary.
You know, it's incredible... how much time you can spend with a person... and still have no idea who they are.
Yeah, I got it.
And remember, don't tell Julian that we were talking.
Are you seeing the ridiculous crap he's spouting on the chat?
Just take care of the documents, okay?
Daniel, have you seen this?
He's on Twitter.
He says that you are FBI, and that I'm CIA.
Look.
This is crazy.
Der Spiegel is begging for more time.
The Times wants to go.
Holger, I've got Nick.
Christ, Putin's gonna go ballistic.
How many more sources do we have to notify in the Middle East?
We're pulling the ambassador.
All right, everybody, listen up!
I need at least 10 names... of high priority sources who could be harmed... if and when these cables are put out.
If we can claim that Assange has blood on his hands... we can turn this thing around.
That's why I signed Hillary's name to it.
I'll see if The Times will hold it.
No, I've got bigger issues.
Yeah, but, what about him, will he?
And don't you tell me that your friend Keller's got him under control.
Any word from Tarek?
He's named in at least a half a dozen of these.
It's a lung flight for a baby.
That's what a nanny's for.
Please...
I left the estimates in the ear.
You need to go home.
There are names, operations.
This leak puts Americans' lives, and our allies' lives at risk.
So, the bugger came through.
Are you still focused on yesterday's news?
On the high priest of truth bragging about a redaction process that didn't exist?
I wouldn't call that yesterday's news.
He ¡s a guest lecturer at University of Cairo.
What are you lecturing about?
We've crossed the border.
Can you put them on?
What do we do now?
Where do we go?
We have tried hard to make sure... that this material does not bring innocents to harm.
We're familiar with groups whose abuses we exposed...
If you want to do this, we have to do it now.
Good journalism exposes powerful abusers... so that often leads to backlashes, but... revolution is... the struggle between the past... and the future.
Actually, Berdymukhammedov himself called for my early retirement.
Well, let's drink to diplomacy.
At least while we still can.
He was talking about all the leaks he'd put out in the last six months alone... and I started thinking.
What is it?
There's something wrong with the submission platform.
It's disabled.
Completely.
No one will be able to submit.
You know, he dyes his hair.
The cult he was in, The Family... they made the kids dye their hair white.
Moments in time that shape them.
There was a moment when everything was possible.
We changed the world.
He changed the world.
But then he made it all about him.
It always was.
Only someone so obsessed with his own secrets... could have come up with a way to reveal everyone else's.
You know, there was a time when British papers... couldn't report on parliamentary debate.
But then a few very brave men... started printing pamphlets and leaking these debates.
And, uh, well, I believe the men were hanged.
But the public saw these pamphlets, and demanded access... and the modern fourth estate was born... from the passion and the vision... of these few brave souls.
Who were hanged.
A new information revolution... infinitely more powerful than the last.
A fifth estate... seemingly hell-bent on destroying its predecessors.
All the old models, dying faster than the new can replace them.
Which is why we need more brave souls.
You and Julian have charted a course through all this chaos... pointed at the truth.
And yes... the tyrants of this world should beware.
So, where should we start?
Well, most good stories start at the beginning.
There is no proof... that anyone came to any harm as a result of the full disclosure... of the unredacted documents published on the WikiLeaks website.
Not one shred of evidence.
These allegations are without basis... and their issue is deeply disturbing.
As an organization, of course of course we, uh, have made mistakes.
That is possibly the greatest mistake.
A WikiLeaks movie?
Which one?
So, if you want the truth... you have to seek it out for yourself.
In fact, that's where the real power lies... in your willingness to look beyond this story... any story.
And as long as you keep searching, you are dangerous to them.
At the beginning of time the clock struck one.
A drop of dew and the clock struck two.
From the dew grew a tree and the clock struck three.
Then the tree made a door and the clock struck four.
Then man came alive and the clock struck five.
Behold I stand at the door and knock.
Is that a new Bradshaw's, Eric?
Or one of your world famous collection of out of date railway timetables?
I have a small problem... which I suspect this gathering might find interesting.
Tickets from Crewe.
Tickets from Crewe.
That should work.
Enjoy your journey, sir.
I could have done with you this morning, in Taunton.
Straight forward enough, surely?
Well in that case you could take it across to--
A friend gave me a lift.
It's also the birthplace of George Formby.
Is it really?
But it was Warrington.
You know, with all due respect to your friend, if all he's mentioned is vodka, he's really only scratched the surface of Warrington.
The Black Prince.
Well if think Warrington's interesting, you wait till we get to Preston.
Lancaster, known as the Hanging Town.
Lancaster Assizes hanged more people than any court in the land, except for London.
That's Carnforth.
That's where they filmed Brief Encounter, apparently.
You're too young to remember that, of course.
Well my Aunt went to see it with a girlfriend and a couple of sailors, and she told me that... whenever the actress...
Sorry.
Promise I'll behave better from now on.
And if I were to fall in love, what then?
Well instead of a coach to Inverness, you might consider taking the line back to Tyndrum and changing for Oban.
It's very romantic.
Are you romantic?
I have to be in Edinburgh... by Wednesday.
Carstairs, now approaching.
It was very nice to meet you.
You were an unexpected bonus.
Thank you again.
So?
What are you going to do?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
There are only two trains from Inverness to Edinburgh on Wednesdays...
Edinburgh Waverley, this is Edinburgh Waverley.
Good afternoon.
Are you catching this train?
It's not entirely a surprise.
I'm not really used to entertaining, as you'll see.
What are you doing?
I was just going to give it a stir.
Because I'm looking at you.
Perfect.
You're making quite a meal of this.
That was the general idea.
You know, I was wondering.
I've never kissed a man with a moustache before.
And I don't think I'm going to kiss a man with a moustache again.
And if the man removed the moustache?
Yes, that would do nicely.
I'm just going to keep looking into those lovely brown eyes.
Why?
I don't know.
Takes my mind off the broken teeth and the shabby clothes.
Not quite so shabby today, actually.
Better get them off so I don't get confused, then.
If you think that's a good idea.
I'm so happy.
Get dressed, Lomax.
- Not for you, Lomax.
He's thrown in the towel, sir?
You can start by destroying anything that might be of value to the enemy.
Quickly, gentlemen.
Might come in handy, sir.
Christ almighty.
One.
Three.
Ten.
Jack.
Queen.
King.
Ace.
So what do you think?
I don't want to take over completely.
Eric?
What have you done?
I decided, on reflection, I preferred things the way they were.
Eric, whatever's wrong, you can talk to me about it.
There's no objection, I hope?
I'm sorry, I really know nothing about this.
Are you in a position to make a payment now, madam?
We are authorised to enter the property and make an inventory of goods.
You can't come in here.
- Drop it!
Please, why won't you talk to me?
Eric, we can't live like this.
Mr Finlay.
Mrs Lomax.
I want to know what happened to Eric.
I've seen... a lot of suffering.
You can do something if you know what's wrong.
I'm sorry I can't help you play Florence Nightingale.
But a lot of men went through something you can't even begin to imagine.
You're going to have to let us just get on and cope with it as best we can.
My husband isn't coping.
He's a mess.
War leaves a mark, Mrs Lomax.
I love him and I want him back.
So he joined the Colonial Service, and built a dam in Africa.
He wrote to me saying they had a narrow gauge railway system and badly needed more engines and rolling stock.
But only the Japanese had the right kind, so he was going to do without.
When he came back, he'd... he'd come to these meetings and just sit there.
Didn't talk at all.
He did anything to avoid people.
Went round and round the country collecting railway memorabilia.
I think that's how he met you.
His whole life has been trains.
Water!
You very lucky boys.
You engineers.
You here to help us.
If you help good, you will have a good war here, in this good place.
If you don't help us, you will go back up the line.
Up the line is not a good place.
Now one by one do number, please.
Eleven.
We should still be out there fighting, now.
Well we must be somewhere.
Why don't you sit here?
Well I counted four days, north, from Singapore up towards Bangkok, which would put us somewhere about here.
Then we turned west.
So?
Well there is no railway line west of Bangkok.
Well you see, the British... they thought about building a railway that would run all the way from where we are here in Thailand into Burma.
Well... building a railway, is a hard, miserable job.
It's usually done by poor immigrant workers.
The great American railways were built by Chinese peasants.
And even the British railways, they were built by Irish navvies fleeing from famine.
But sometimes, a railway is simply too difficult to build.
Well it's hundred of miles to Burma... through mountains and jungle.
The British decided, that to build such a railway, it would be an act not of engineering, but of extreme barbarity... and cruelty.
And we've just become that army.
And we are going to do our best for those poor bastards up the line.
Lomax, Withins, how are we fixed for a radio?
There it is.
Did you get it?
That's good.
We need a battery, but, Lomax... what else do we need?
Who got that?
Jackson, I think.
But he's up the line.
Oh, great.
Major?
Major York?
What seems to be the problem?
Jackson...
The river?
Thank you.
Ready?
What if Hitler's in London?
What do we tell the men?
I can't say it sounds very likely.
It's running!
This is the BBC Home and Forces program.
This is Bruce Belfidge.
The Axis forces in the Western Desert after twelve days and nights of ceaseless attacks by our land and air forces are now in full retreat.
Their disordered columns are being relentlessly attacked by our land forces and by the Allied air forces by day and night.
In the morning there was a rumour that German tanks were just over the hill.
Armed patrols went out on the road.
Got them on the run, sir.
Sir?
Come on, sir.
We've got Hitler on the run.
That's it, sir.
And we're bombing Germany 24 hours a day, now the US Air Force has joined in.
The men, sir, right?
You've got to let them know it's going our way.
The Russians have taken Stalingrad.
Be careful.
...went on fighting until they had little ammunition left.
Our troops in the north put down a smokescreen and under cover they withdrew a little while our bombers went in in three deadly waves to deliver a large aerial bombardment and one of the heaviest of the whole campaign.
They rang the church bells at home for the first time since the beginning of the war.
Thorlby.
Finlay.
Withins.
Lomax.
Lomax!
I think it was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
Surely goodness and... mercy will follow me for the rest of my life.
It was... madness.
But you can talk about it.
Why can't he talk to me about it?
I told you, you couldn't possibly imagine what he's been through.
Please don't shut me out.
Please.
We did our best to put him back together again.
But we knew it wasn't over.
They came for him.
You will be killed shortly, but it will be to your advantage to tell me the truth.
Raise your arms.
You will come with me.
And then we didn't see him for two weeks.
He never told me what they did to him.
I have to try.
Patti.
I hope you're not planning to throw yourself in there.
As a gentleman I'd feel obliged to go in after you, and that may well be the end of me.
The men used to call me Uncle.
They thought I'd look after them, and I did, while we were there.
But here... every month I stare into those... bitter, half-awake faces, and I know they desperately need me to put them back together again.
But I can't.
There's nothing I can do for them now.
I think you do more than you know.
Eric did something wonderful.
He stuck his neck out to give us hope in a nightmare 5,000 miles from home.
He should have... medals and glory.
Can't you make him understand that?
No.
It's too late.
The only time I've seen him light up was when you came along.
I think it's the most dangerous thing I've ever held in my hand.
You must decide... if Eric should see it.
Nagase.
I don't know what he will do... if we tell him.
But doesn't Eric deserve a chance... for justice?
Whatever he does.
It's him, isn't it?
Can you believe that?
He's alive?
Bridge on the bloody River Kwai holidays.
Nagase.
I've had it translated.
Look him up.
He won't have a clue you're coming.
I've nursed myself to sleep on those sounds.
And the snapping of the hyoid bone, and the chopstick through the eye.
Your timing's off.
What do you mean?
We're not soldiers anymore, Uncle.
We're bank clerks, school teachers, engineers, retired persons.
If you'd come to me with this a year ago, I'd have hunted him down.
No husband would treat her the way you do.
You punish her.
When we surrendered, the Japs said we weren't men.
But we didn't, no.
We don't live.
We're miming in the choir.
We're an army of ghosts.
What happened in that room?
What did they do to you?
I think you should go now.
Don't waste this.
At least one of us deserves some peace.
You do this for me.
Please.
You... you want me to come with you?
I thought we'd take him along the front, give him a little tour.
You know we met on a train.
You can't just say "a train" when you're talking about Eric.
You have to say which train, when it was built where it was stopping, how many wheels it had.
I'm going to send him a message.
Something he won't be able to ignore.
Oh, my God.
Alright, thank you.
It's Finlay...
Where?
Warminster.
This is what you're going to do, isn't it?
Isn't that what you want?
That's what happens when you start interfering.
Hope you're happy.
One.
Two.
Ten.
Jack.
Queen.
King.
The flowers are an offering for the Mother of Waters.
They symbolise the desire to atone for any evil that the pilgrim has done in life.
Buddha is not a name.
It is a title, like your saint, perhaps.
Come this way, please.
I am from Japan.
I come to this place on a pilgrimage.
This is my 57th pilgrimage.
This area was occupied by my country during the war.
We are going to the War Museum over in Kempeitai.
Thanks for coming.
See you.
Thank you, please.
I've come a very long way.
I have a particular interest in knowing what happened here.
What happened to these men?
It will be open again tomorrow morning.
Perhaps you could return then?
I'm afraid this won't keep till tomorrow.
I'm surprised you don't recognise me.
Sit down, Mr Nagase.
We won't be needing an interpreter this time.
Of course, that wasn't your real function last time, was it?
You will be killed shortly.
But it will be to your advantage to answer my questions in the meantime.
How can it be to my advantage?
Your friends have already admitted to building a radio... in order to conspire with our enemy.
They also said that you're the ringleader of the plot.
He can do a lot worse... than to kill you.
We want to know about the map.
Why did you draw a map?
- Well it's a map of the railway.
- He knows that.
Who's it for?
We know it is the railway.
Why did you draw a map of the railway?
I'm a railway enthusiast.
Enthusiast?
I like trains.
I really like trains.
No, I didn't.
How could I do that?
You received information and then passed it on to them with this.
How could I do that?
But it's a receiver.
How can you transmit with a receiver?
You built this transmitter to tell the Chinese about our railway!
You do not ask questions.
I'm just trying to help you.
Thank you.
They were afraid you were--
I am at a loss.
- I want to ask--
Why did you build the radio?
Who helped you to build the radio?
To hear voices.
To know what was happening at home.
At the beginning of time the clock struck one.
Then dropped the dew and the clock struck two.
Who asked you to draw the map?
From the dew grew a tree and the clock struck three.
Where did you get the components for the radio?
Then the tree made a door and the clock struck four.
Man came alive and the clock struck five.
Behold I stand at the door and knock.
I did not expect you to be alive.
Why are you alive?
You were Kempeitai, you knew everything!
Why did they let you live?
We are civilised human beings, but we do need to see that justice is done.
You're going to be transferred to Bangkok while we look into some of the charges that have been made against you.
Yes, sir.
Translator.
Did you work for the Kempeitai?
Only translation.
Over there.
I worked for the War Graves Commission.
They needed interpreters.
We identified them.
We brought them here to be buried properly.
I had not imagined so many had died.
Murdered.
The word you're looking for is murdered.
So many had been murdered.
So I will speak.
I make pilgrimages.
I work for... reconciliation.
The tragedy of war.
You're not tragic.
You're a criminal.
You were an intelligent, educated man and you did nothing.
If I can help you...
Alright!
I'll tell you everything we heard on the radio.
I'll tell you the truth.
There's shortages of food and fuel all over Japan.
Your homes are burning and your families are starving.
That is what I heard on the radio.
You're a liar.
You tell lies.
You have no honour.
Your army is defeated.
You should be ashamed to be alive.
My mother was already dead, as it happens.
We do not talk about it.
No one will talk about it.
Nor do we.
And you know why?
Because no one would believe it.
No one would believe what you did to us.
You treated us like animals because we surrendered.
You said you'd rather die... than live without honour.
But you didn't die.
It was a lie they told us.
It was all lies.
That we would win.
We would have honour.
They lied to us.
Only you told me the truth.
No matter what we did to you, you held on.
You showed me that nothing's worth more than this life.
He was a prisoner here.
He put your life in my hands.
He wanted an end to this.
Maybe... that is why I am alive.
For this day.
Maybe we both lived... for this day.
You can make an end.
You are a soldier, Lomax.
You never surrendered.
I'm still at war.
I thought I'd lost you.
When Finlay died, I was scared.
I was scared that the same might happen to you.
It was different for Finlay.
He didn't have you.
We treated you and your countrymen very, very badly.
The dagger of our meeting thrust deep into my heart.
I never forgot you.
I have to go back.
I want you to come with me.
I wouldn't have lasted a day here.
If you'd been here, you'd have caused quite a stir.
You'd have outlasted the lot of us.
I am sorry.
So sorry.
I don't want to live that day anymore.
Neither do I.
Dear Mr Nagase, the war has been over for many years.
And you have been most courageous and brave in working for reconciliation.
Sometime the hating has to stop.
Oh, that Celia!
I haven't seen her in a very long time.
May I confide in you?
There's something I really must find out.
Something of great moment.
A mystery.
Celia Ravenscroft, you see, intends to marry my son Desmond.
Why is that a mystery?
Did her father kill her mother?
Or did the mother kill the father?
You must remember.
General and Mrs Ravenscroft.
Of course I remember, it's just that I couldn't quite believe my ears, Mrs...
Burton-Cox.
Mrs Burton-Cox, it has been nice meeting you.
But I must find out the truth.
It was impossible to shake her off.
What would you do, were you me?
The thing that you should do, madame, and this I advise you to do most strenuously, is nothing, rien.
I heard you were coming.
Ah, Detective Sergeant Beale!
Detective Inspector.
Was he still practising, Dr Willoughby?
He'd been semi-retired for years.
In effect, I run the institute.
But my father kept his office and continued his research.
In your kind of work, Doctor, is this kind of contraption normal?
Hydriatic procedures in the treatment of insanity were quite common
Come away, Doctor.
I hope you don't mind that I called for Monsieur Poirot straight away.
No, I don't.
Poirot and I have worked together before.
I hope you don't mind my asking you to vouch for your movements last night.
This was my own father.
The procedure is quite standard, cher ami.
Did you sleep at home?
Did you know your father was in the building?
There's a cop on the door.
Please don't be alarmed, Marie.
It's very good to see you, Mrs Oliver.
Crime writer of the year.
Something quite delicate.
She thought I might know something about it.
We were finished together in Paris.
But then I married and went somewhere and she married and went somewhere.
What can you tell me, Ariadne?
But I think of it constantly.
Please, please find out what happened.
Will you help me, Ariadne?
I have to help Celia.
Je suis desole, madame.
I have an affair of consequence to which I must attend.
Give me one moment of your time.
My friend Margaret Ravenscroft died a horrible death.
A husband and wife who never argue, who live in complete harmony.
You must delve into the past.
You say they lived near to Eastbourne?
Be the person with a nose.
If I had to say which was most likely, I should say my father.
There was an old housekeeper.
She was half blind and a bit deaf.
Sometimes there was my aunt.
She'd come back to help Mummy, who'd been unwell.
Ariadne!
Where did we last meet?
The Llewellyn wedding, was it?
All the bridesmaids in a vile shade of apricot!
Other things one forgets.
I saw my god-daughter the other day.
I don't know if she had cancer if she was just bald.
Awful business though.
At the time of the shooting, I was in America.
- Speaking engagements.
- You're so modern, Ariadne!
No-one else in my circle has speaking engagements!
They only left the house to take a walk.
They didn't come back for their dinner.
Somebody or other found them dead.
The revolver was lying by their bodies.
Bloody hard on the dog, I thought.
Fear of the natives, you see.
Not usually a problem in Sussex.
Unfathomable things in everybody's lives.
Didn't like India at all.
What was the gossip, Julia?
People thought he might have shot his wife because he wanted to marry her.
I always thought it was more about Margaret.
I can't help thinking there might have been a man.
All I'm saying is one of them was having an affair.
In this part of the world, Ariadne, one either hunts or one has affairs.
It is a variation on what the French call le bain de surprise.
The principle, it is one of severe shock to the system.
And is often used in conjunction with the electro-shock therapy.
I'm quite glad I'm normal.
We may all be thankful, mon ami, that we are in possession of our minds.
Some of us more so than others.
Everything is in order.
Creepy, isn't it?
I have the kettle boiling if you gentlemen would like a cup of tea.
It's about a ten-minute walk.
Did you walk home on the night Professor Willoughby was murdered?
Is there someone can vouch for you being at home all night?
May I enquire, mademoiselle, from where do you originate?
I guess I just had a yen to live in England for a while and do the things that English people do.
By which, I do not mean murdering eminent professors of psychiatry.
I'd say the stakes are high, wouldn't you?
How well did you know Professor Willoughby?
I didn't know him at all.
You can't tell us anything about what he's currently working on.
I'm a filing clerk.
I just answer the telephone, make the tea.
If you please to return to the night of the murder.
I didn't see any of the other girls.
I see.
I didn't know that.
I assumed he'd gone home.
Well, well, it must be years!
It IS years, Nanny.
All my little boys and girls.
All over the world I went.
Here's your tea, Mrs Matcham.
Thank you, my dear.
- I'll finish that.
You really are such a help.
Did you say the Burton-Coxes?
Or did I mean the Carter-Foxes?
Everybody was very friendly out there.
Did you by any chance meet the Ravenscrofts when you were on that visit?
They said that she'd always been touched.
And then there was that story of the baby and the river.
They'd let her have them back, the boy and the girl.
It was the boy this time.
Always beautifully turned out.
I don't know what was wrong with her, but she had to have an operation.
I didn't know she had a sister.
He'd work all night and sleep all day if it suited him.
Was he married?
I'm a trustee, that's all.
Are you aware of any resentment, any animosity, professional or otherwise, which your father might have incurred?
My father was very highly respected.
And it was last night that you told me that it is many years since your father abandoned his experiments with the hydrotherapy.
Yes, that's right.
Look, the hydro room has been in disuse for just about as long as I can remember.
I thought you might need some tea.
I've barely been in it.
Sugar?
Must have been someone quite strong, or more than one person, to have manipulated the professor into the contraption.
Je ne sais pas.
But it seems as though someone is giving him back a soupcon of his own medicine.
Medicine he hasn't used in nigh on 20 years.
Celia, darling, we're rehearsing.
We need to talk.
Good evening, Mrs Oliver.
No, no, you must think me a complete ninny.
Are you all right?
And that he was smitten with a young woman who acted as his secretary.
The result being that he shot his wife because he hoped to marry the girl.
It says here... she had four wigs.
And now I must set myself to consider the case of Professor Willoughby.
She knew the Ravenscrofts in India.
She was sure there was a mental case in the family.
Never heard of her before.
She wasn't at Margaret's wedding.
That's odd in itself, isn't it?
It seems possible that she'd killed children.
Even, perhaps, her own children.
She went out to Margaret in India, where there was another incident.
What you discovered in Sussex was merely the mirrors and the smoke.
So why, on the evening of the most beautiful day, should they take a walk together along the cliffs, taking with them a revolver and a dog?
One of the elephants said that the dog was devoted to Lady Ravenscroft.
Another said that it bit her.
My name is Desmond Burton-Cox.
It's no concern of hers whether I marry Celia.
Why are you here, monsieur?
Someone attacked me at the music school this evening.
I fear she may have put someone up to it.
Why should she wish to do that?
When I was a child, let's just say she did some terrible things.
Now she wants to stop me getting married.
She's been trying to scare Celia with awful rumours...
Because she's mean, possessive.
Pour quoi?
I'd formed an attachment to someone and I wouldn't give it up.
My mother was livid and marched me off to Dr Willoughby.
Please to sit.
Genetic characteristics, similar and dissimilar environments, blood types, pathologies.
Otherwise, you're in a bit of a sticky wicket, aren't you?
The Ravenscrofts married in 1913.
She had a sister, Dorothea, who married a Captain Jarrow.
They were blighted by misfortune though.
But then it turned out there was another story.
One of the neighbours said the mother herself had done it.
I mean, she went raving mad.
Had to be hospitalised.
So, Mr Garroway, was she staying with the Ravenscrofts when they were shot?
She takes a lot of tranquilisers and she sleepwalks.
One night, she leaves the house, wanders along the cliff edge, loses her footing, and over she goes.
They don't find her till the next morning.
No-one has the first idea of a motive, then or now.
Could there be a third party?
No, it all points to a suicide pact and yet...
She was more concerned about the dog.
And one with strawberry-blonde curls, I recall.
One of Bert's finest.
He cares for you most deeply.
Mademoiselle, may I ask you a question that is personal?
If you are in love with Monsieur Desmond Burton-Cox, then that is all that matters.
This allowance, mademoiselle, it is something that his mother could withhold?
You mean she'd cut off the money if he marries me?
I hadn't thought of that.
Tell to me, if you please, Madame Burton-Cox, was she friendly with your late mother and father?
Look, whoever you are, if I'm going to marry Desmond, and live with him forever, I need to know the truth.
But the truth, mademoiselle she can be cruel.
Poirot, it's Inspector Beale.
I have that information you asked for.
Desmond Burton-Cox's natural mother was an actress.
She moved to California, where she found considerable success in moving pictures under the name Katy Lestrange.
18 months ago, Katy Lestrange died of a barbiturate overdose in Pasadena.
- There's been something of a turn-up.
Miss McDermott, will you come in now, please?
Repeat to Mr Poirot what you said earlier.
But I can't stand by and see him swing for something he didn't do.
And he was with you all of the night?
It must have been at that time that the night watchman raised the alarm.
But he is a fool.
It is a brave thing that you do, ma petite.
My reputation was shot in the States.
Might as well be shot here too.
I have a question.
It was last summer that you arrived in England?
I'm not exactly proud of myself, Poirot.
Things are pretty awkward around here.
Somehow Jacqueline seems to have found out about the whole wretched business.
Mademoiselle Marie McDermott, she provides you with the alibi and you are no longer the suspect.
Nice girl.
Tell to me more about the patients of your father.
Do you recall a Dorothea Jarrow?
Mrs Jarrow was considered to be one of my father's triumphs.
Her husband had died on the Western front.
That left her rather fragile, I'm afraid.
To my father's eyes, Dorothea's condition presented very decided dangers.
She was prone to mood swings and acts of violence.
He thought she should be kept under observation.
She said she hit him with a spade and he fell into an ornamental pond and drowned.
So perhaps Margaret suffers from the same malady as Dorothea.
General Ravenscroft had throughout paid for his sister-in-law to receive the best treatment in England.
He was on good terms with my father.
When they returned from India, they often had Dorothea to stay.
Alistair Ravenscroft fell in love with her.
In your files, mon ami, there are many histories that are very absorbing.
But you know there is a patient that is missing?
I ask about the boy who has 15 years of age.
A certain Desmond Burton-Cox.
Where is his case file?
I took no payment and so there is no file.
You took no payment?
- She had no money, Poirot.
Look, self-control is not one of my stronger qualities.
I just have to live with it.
I see.
But I only ask about the boy Desmond.
Remarkable power of recall.
The smallest details of his childhood were easy to surface.
But lacking in self-confidence.
Would you say he was in love?
I've spoken to my god-daughter Celia.
Monsieur Poirot is... my assistant.
You have concerns about the marriage of your son Desmond with Mademoiselle Celia Ravenscroft.
But it's important to know the background, don't you think?
Is it possible that there was anyone else staying at Overcliff at the time of the deaths of your parents?
Anyone perhaps whom the police did not know about.
And you yourself, have you ever returned to Overcliff?
But how do we find her?
Miss Ravenscroft, good of you to come.
Look at all those diamonds!
Very good.
Enjoying it, Ariadne?
Please to forgive the intrusion, monsieur.
Unless you give to me the address of Mademoiselle Zelie Rouxelle.
- I don't know it.
I demand to know the address of Mademoiselle Zelie Rouxelle, tout de suite!
Merci, monsieur.
Taxi!
Oh, Inspector Beale told me you'd be here.
The housekeeper said the dog had turned on its mistress a couple of days before.
As I said to you in my telegram, I wish to ask you about the General and the Lady Ravenscroft.
But what is there to understand, monsieur?
It was a double suicide.
And you have found no reason to doubt that?
The police found no reason to doubt it.
So there is nothing more you can tell to me, Mademoiselle Rouxelle?
For how long were you living at Overcliff before their deaths?
How much do you know?
I'm so sorry, my darling.
Guys like you are always sorry.
I wonder if you can.
I wanted to see if there was anything in your files pertaining to the treatment of Dorothea Jarrow.
And Dorothea and Margaret, they were fond of each other?
And in many ways, they were alike.
Pardon.
But in twins, although there is this bond of love if something should occur to break it, then it is shattered forever.
Oh yes, I know.
And love, it may easily turn to hate.
And it is easier to hate what you have once loved than to remain indifferent.
Do you speak from experience?
Tell to me about Dorothea Jarrow.
She lived in a state of terrible strain.
She was never happy.
No, but there are events of which you do have the first-hand knowledge.
Isn't it better to leave things when at least they have been accepted?
He had a good heart.
And you were also in love with him, I think.
You may not speak to me like that.
One can love and serve and still be happy.
You served him loyally in the great crisis of his life.
You pretended to the police that you had only the little English.
It was as if I had been shot.
I have hidden myself away.
Because you have a heart, Zelie.
And because Celia and Desmond, they need to know.
But they should be.
I do hope you had a nice time in Paris.
This is the deed of covenant for the legacy left to Desmond by his natural mother.
So if he marries Celia, he'll come into a fortune.
But how does this fit in with Mrs Burton-Cox wanting to know about the deaths of the Ravenscrofts?
She is not concerned with the deaths of the Ravenscrofts, non.
Her sole concern is to prevent the marriage.
She has been to the Willoughby Institute?
Now she has gone to Eastbourne?
Excuse me.
Up there, sir!
Monsieur, mademoiselle.
The question to be put, it is this.
Because one or the other must be true.
But Poirot, he says to you that both are true.
And I fear, Mademoiselle Celia, it is a tragedy of two people who loved each other, and who died for love.
At first, they seemed to have no value.
But everything has a value.
Everyone remembers something.
Four!
You mean the dog knew she would commit suicide?
Non, it is much more simple than that.
Could it be her twin sister Dorothea?
But now I come to something else that was brought to my attention by Madame Oliver.
This I learned from the evidence of Julia Carstairs in your notebook, madame.
So her visits to the hospital pass unremarked.
I don't think Julia Carstairs knew what she was talking about!
And we have reason to believe that one and and possibly two children died at her hands.
And the general, having the feelings of guilt so terrible, pays for her to have treatment at the Willoughby Institute.
Are you saying, sir, that the mad aunt shot the Ravenscrofts?
It was Dorothea who killed your mother.
Often, they would go for a walk together in the evenings.
But one evening, she returned alone.
We'll take the cliff path.
She doesn't know what she's doing.
I know it's bad, Zelie.
Don't let them give her that treatment again.
Make him do as I ask.
I promise, Margaret.
Thank you.
And he asked Zelie to help him.
Forgive me, my darling.
Forgive me.
Celia, are you all right?
It's better to know.
They agreed to say it was Dorothea who walked in her sleep and fell to her death, not Margaret.
They hid her in a cottage for a week or ten days.
Zelie, she had gone to London and bought wigs to fit Dorothea from Eugene and Rosentelle of Bond Street.
Then they brought her back.
Zelie, today is your last day of work.
I am sending you back to Paris.
You cannot do that.
I can, my dear, and I will.
Stop here.
And this is for me.
He had to keep his promise to his wife.
And he did.
I am so sorry, Mademoiselle Celia.
Bring her in.
Please to take off her cap.
This is Marie Jarrow.
The daughter of your aunt Dorothea.
Everyone knows what they were doing on the 17th of March.
Also, your accent, mademoiselle.
And it is you, Mademoiselle Jarrow, who killed Professor Willoughby.
I still got them.
And he likes a little sleep after pleasure.
His little sleeps turn into longer sleeps.
Meanwhile, she has become friendly with Professor Willoughby.
I told him the Willoughby Institute was going to go down big in the history of psychiatry.
And then you persuade the professor to show to you the hydro room.
Oh, my children.
What are you going to do?
If I could have killed him over again, I would!
Was it you who tried to strangle me?
Mademoiselle Rouxelle.
I hope you do not blame me, mademoiselle, for asking for your help.
Look.
Now they will have their future.
You and I are elephants, you know.
And human beings, mercifully, they can forget.
Let's go shopping-
I want to lead a huge charity organization.
I want to lead a country one day, for all I know.
Come on, girls.
Girls!
Time for your Adderall.
Well, let's do our morning prayer, okay?
My chief aim in life is to continually strive... to be the best person that I can be for the greater good of the planet... and everyone who walks on it.
Bye.
- Hey, new kid.
- You got Jamis for English?
- Yeah.
It's down here.
For having substances you're not supposed to have at school.
Totes, and then have my own line and fragrance, host my own show.
- Going to, uh, Carly's later?
My mom and her douchey husband are out of town... if you guys want to come over later.
Yeah.
- I could be down.
I can't wait to get out of here.
- So, is your mom away a lot?
- Yeah, she goes on trips a lot for work.
She has a chain of student tutoring centers.
And you're at Indian Hills?
So, what do your parents do?
Come on.
What are you doing?
It's locked too.
Shit. it's open.
How did you meet Rebecca?
I met Rebecca in school after I'd moved back and went to Indian Hills.
Um, I went there 'cause I had a lot of absences.
- I thought that I was ugly.
- You're not ugly.
Want a ride?
Hey, where we going?
Wherever we want.
Do you know anybody that's out of town?
- Where does Evan live?
- Woodland Hills.
How well do you know Evan?
I mean, we met up a few times.
He's pretty hot.
It's a nice place.
It's a Birkin.
Great.
Lindsay has this one.
I think we need to get out of here.
Oh, yeah.
What is it?
No way.
What the fuck?
Get in.
Where'd you get the keys?
I got them on the way out.
How long's Evan in Jamaica?
This is so cute.
Would this be good on me?
This would look so good on you.
What do you think about this?
Oh, no.
That's amazing.
Picture.
Hurry UP-
- For sure.
- Are they sisters?
No, they've known each other since they were, like, three.
I'll probably meet him later.
Yeah, I bet you're really gonna hesitate on that one.
- Bitch, you're just jealous.
That's Kirsten Dunst.
Girls.
And we got some huge music manager coming, some executive producer from Entourage.
Look at Sam.
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.
Drinks up.
I literally thought I was gonna die.
Thank you.
I loved her.
I really did.
She was the first person I felt like was my best friend.
I loved her almost like a sister.
That's what made this situation so hard.
Okay, this morning's lesson is on character development.
So in The Secret, we talk about the law of attraction... and how we need to be really careful about who we surround ourselves with... because we wind up being the average of those people.
So we are going to make vision boards... about people who are demonstrating good character... like Angelina Jolie.
So, what qualities do you guys admire about Angelina Jolie?
Well, we're gonna do it until we finish... and then we're gonna move on to the ﬂuorescence work.
Got it.
Water delivery.
Come in.
Paris Hilton's hosting a party in Vegas tonight.
Let's go there.
Do you think we could find a way in?
Uh, looks like you get in going up this hill by her house.
I bet she'd leave her keys under her mat.
Awesome!
Oh, my fucking gosh!
Holy shit.
No way.
- Becca, I don't-
- Oh, my God.
Let's keep going.
Come on.
Look at her sunglasses.
These are Alexander McQueen.
Come on.
I know, right?
She has so much stuff.
It's amazing.
- We gotta go.
- Isn't that beautiful?
We just have to check when she's going out to something.
Try this with it.
What do you think?
Try it with your hair back.
- Leopard and zebra?
- What?
I want to rob.
I didn't know what they were doing.
I thought they were my friends.
It all comes back to, like, bad choices... who you have as your friends.
And I know the truth will come out.
- Look.
- Look at this!
Dude, look at these!
So cute.
Rebecca, I don't think-
- Paris Hilton.
- That's fucked-up.
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing later?
Come on, Peter Pan.
- You can't take her dog.
- But he likes me... and I could get, like, 500 for him.
Bye, Peter Pan.
Maybe over by the garbage can.
Damn it.
What?
So have you toned down the partying now that you have a relationship... or are you still going out?
Can you see where she lives?
I don't need the glasses.
Come on.
I'm gonna stay on lookout.
Gross.
Did you guys hear that?
I hear helicopters.
Don't be such a little bitch.
Can we speed it up?
Let me see that.
Is it loaded?
I don't know.
Maybe.
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Can you not grab me, brother?
That's good.
- Stop it.
- Did you just push a girl?
If I ever became not your friend anymore, would you rob me?
I would never do that to you.
I want to get some Victoria's Secret model clothes.
Sweet.
Let's go.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- One second, Mom.
It's time for dinner.
Be right there.
- Hey, Chloe.
He let us borrow some stuff for the auditions.
His dad has a production company that he helps style for.
What's it called?
Uh, Mom, we actually have to get going... because we're meeting this manager tonight who could be really helpful.
Yeah, he knows a lot of photographers and producers, so-
I'd totally do that singer guy.
- But did you see how small his hands are?
- Does this look good?
Yeah, I mean, do you feel good in that?
My butt look good in these jeans?
Your butt looks awesome.
Come on.
I was wondering if you could, uh- could sell these for me.
- Where'd you get them?
- Uh, we found them.
I see.
I don't know.
I could see.
Aren't they worth a lot more?
Thank you.
Sure, kid.
When we went out, we got in everywhere, and everyone loved us.
We had so many beautiful, gorgeous things.
How many times have you guys been up here?
- This is, like, our fifth time.
- And she never noticed?
Now fix your hair.
You're like an off-duty supermodel.
- Really?
- Hello?
I can't talk.
- Everything all right in here?
- Yes, Mr. Hall.
We're sorry for making too much noise.
Everything's fine, Dad.
All right.
You're stressing me out.
I know.
I want to go to Rachel Bilson's.
She's in Paris for fashion week.
I want some Chanel.
Is she still dating Hayden Christensen?
I don't know.
Marc thinks so.
And I think her projecting that onto me made me think that it was gonna be okay.
I can't believe she went to Paris Hilton's house.
You went to Rachel Bilson's?
- Shut the fuck up.
We just went in.
Yeah, look at their chill-ass Chanel purses, dude.
Rebecca's, like, biggest conquest was Lindsay Lohan.
She was her ultimate fashion icon.
Lindsay Lohan is fighting back against accusations... she stole a $2,500 necklace from a Southern California jewelry store.
Her attorney addressed the matter for the first time.
I want to try it on. it's amazing.
Bye.
Why do you think Rebecca was so obsessed with these women and their clothes- enough to steal?
Lindsay Lohan gave police the security footage... from the night of March 23, when her house was burglarized.
Comparing the clips... it looks like these are the same burglars... as in the Audrina Patridge security video... and police are investigating the connection... of the Hollywood Hills burglaries.
If you have any information, please contact the LAPD.
- I'll-I'll get him.
Mom.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney present during any questioning, okay?
- Out of the way.
- For what?
- Sit down over there.
- Why?
- Why?
Can you call the-Ow!
- Ls this the home of Rebecca Ahn?
I'm her mother, but she's staying with her father in Nevada.
Then Rebecca wanted to go to Orlando Bloom's.
The door was unlocked?
I'm really sorry about what I did.
Did you know Rebecca was leaving the state?
You didn't know she was taking stolen property... across state lines and leaving you holding the bag?
I thought she was just gonna go see her dad.
- Yes.
Move back.
Here's your warrant.
- Why do you think we're here?
- Do you know why?
- Have you ever been... to these celebrity homes that were burglarized?
No.
Anything else?
- Yeah, we also came up with these.
We found a jacket and jeans that match a description by Lohan... and some personal photographs of Paris Hilton.
Rebecca Ahn, thought to be the ringleader, was arrested... and awaits her hearing with the other members.
Stay tuned for the latest on the Bling Ring.
Did you speak to any of the victims?
I've spoken to all the victims.
Really?
What did Lindsay say?
- It was not good.
Okay, thank you.
Can I get you something to drink?
So how is Sam related?
- We have adopted her.
- I was friends with her mother.
Um, we met when my parents divorced... and now my mom home schools all of us.
I'm sorry.
And our moms became, like, best friends.
But let's, uh- Let's-Let's get back to Nicki, okay?
Um, my other sister, Gabby, is on a trip with them building homes.
And they do a yearly trip to Africa... where they build wells and schools for kids.
Which country?
Um, I can't remember exactly which country... but we do bake sales and, like, feeding the homeless and that kind of stuff.
Nicki, I don't want you to answer that comment.
Well, I think that I am-
I have, like, a good statement to say about this.
She could speak generally.
I think this situation was attracted into my life... as a huge learning lesson for me... to grow and expand as a spiritual human being.
I believe that I am an old soul.
We've gotten to know Nicki and her family... and we believe that she is an extremely focused and honest young woman... who has a lot to offer the community.
And we agree that there has not been a disconnect- that there were circumstances that happened... but Nicki herself has continued to stay on her plane... despite the tumultuous experiences happening.
What's your goal, or life plan, if you have one?
Nicki's expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism.
It's my main goal.
I... want to be a leader... and do things that people really notice.
That's why I'm taking business- so that I can be a leader... and-and take a stand for people.
But I went to Indian Hills to learn and be with my peers... but I was always self-conscious that I wasn't, you know, as good-looking as other people.
But it's kind of showing America has this- this sick fascination with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.
Maybe with a jacket?
Where are my kitten heels?
You're so lucky you weren't on that video.
Maybe I need to wear something longer.
Okay, just remember what we went over with Shannon.
I know there is one mind, one presence and one power.
I know I'm always protected, and karma cleanses my journey.
Thank you, Lord, so much for this truth.
This has been a very difficult time for myself and my family.
Thank you for respecting my privacy.
I look forward to my day in court.
Robert Hernandez, you are found guilty on one count of first-degree-
Members of the Bling Ring were sentenced today... for their role in a rash of break-ins... that netted more than three million in high-end goods.
We're here with Nicki Moore... who just served 30 days for her involvement in the Bling Ring... and shared a cell block with one of its victims, Lindsay Lohan.
There were reports that Lindsay was crying.
With you being next to her, did you actually hear any of this?
But I just really kept to myself... and just tried to get through the day.
It's hard when you're woken up at, like, 5:30.
And how'd she look?
She got to keep her extensions in.
A lot of the girls were talking- "Oh, I had to take my weave out," or whatever.
But, um, she was in orange like all of us.
Now, were you nervous being next to her?
Because you actually were accused of being a part of the group... that allegedly robbed her house.
They were showing the surveillance video.
I mean, when I get to tell my side of this story... people are gonna know the truth.
But, you know, anyway... you can follow everything about me and my journey...
Sweetheart.
Go over to the window right now and open it as wide as you can.
Please let me sleep.
I think your mother's here from Mexico, and she needs to leave.
Open the window now.
Why don't you open it, you lazy...
Close your mouth!
A deer!
Daddy, I left the front door open in case any animals wanted to come in.
- Daddy, no!
What's he looking at?
Three times, fast.
Give me that thing.
You want to play with him?
All right, let's go play in the other room.
Problem solved.
Is that your bra, Mrs. Feder?
Easy.
28?
Okay, Bean, well, what's seven plus nine?
Is he a little boy or a computer?
Don't destroy his confidence.
Happy summer, everybody.
Okay, you sure you want to go with those boots, honey?
It's the last day of school, and Mom says I'm free to express myself.
Building the confidence right here with R2-D2.
You're gonna need federal aid to clean that up.
Ronnie, honey, did a doo-doo grenade go off in your diaper?
All right, I'm going in.
What is this?
A necklace?
Mom didn't.
That's cold.
Braden needs to spend at least one summer with you so he can say he has a dad, you deadbeat, Higgins.
Well, not to be mean, but I'm not even 1,000% sure who you are.
And no offense, but I'm gonna have to ask for a DNA test, you know, because you just never...
You're him.
Yeah, without the hat.
It's actually a good likeness.
How you doing, man?
I'm your dad.
Nice to see you, Braden.
That's strike one.
Summertime.
Well, let's get going.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, don't forget this.
How would you feel about expanding?
But it's perfect right now, you know?
I mean, I get to go to that?
Is that why you've been taking them long showers?
- Higgins.
- I should kill him.
He's too chicken to ask her out, Dad, 'cause she's the hottest girl in school, and Greg is fugly.
Only in, like, a Hollywood movie or something.
Number one, make the girl smile.
Number two, tell her she has a nice smile.
Number three, say she has to go out with you that night.
By the way, Dad, did you ask Mom if I can play football?
Come on, Becky, it's 8:00.
Daddy, you promise Mr. Gigglesworth will be better by bedtime?
Yeah, 'cause thank God there's no crazy people out here.
How you doing, Nick?
My wife's leaving me after three weeks.
Three weeks?
She found me eating a banana with my butt.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your new bus driver.
That's not another necklace in there, is it?
I mean, maybe I'll walk on the good rug without taking off my boots.
Well, it's been many, many years since we've done something crazy.
Because we already have chicks and kids and high cholesterol now, sojust...
Hey, hey, where'd you get those shoes, Losers "R" Us?
In a toilet?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Attention, Kmart shoppers, let's find a seat, please.
Beanbag with arms and legs, seriously, take a seat, or seats, before someone gets hurt.
You're dead, man.
I'm gonna go get some things done, and then I'm gonna go to my daughter's ballet recital, so you're on your own until lunchtime.
Right.
Your husband.
Lenny.
I probably should have told you this before I started working here, but he used to be my boyfriend.
When did you guys go out?
I brought in a note that he sent me, and I thought you should see it.
I just felt weird having a secret with you.
"Do you like my hair better in a barrette or a headband?"
And that was his response.
Does it bother you that I still wear it?
No, no, no, I think it's sweet.
Do you really think that a tight, toned body will keep him away from his Hubba Bubba baby?
I hope so.
You just messed with the wrong girl, chica!
They spray-painted my baby.
Have a nice day, Rapunzel.
Hey, guys, can you believe this?
Calendar turns to June, my wonderful students, they become animals.
Maybe they're just mad that you keep going to the babyGap to buy your clothes.
How was your last ride in before the summer, Nick?
Get in.
Watch this.
What's Lenny's problem?
They're so cute when they're little.
She was just joking around, sir.
Welcome to Squat Fitness, ladies.
Now, everybody turn, face the back of the room, bend over, and reach for your toes.
Why do we have to turn around?
If you please.
And bend over as low as you can go.
Now take the right hand and slap it against the right cheek.
Relax the wrist and slap that right butt, slap it.
Morning, ladies.
You started without me?
Yes, just like you asked me to.
I wish they called it something else, but that's what they told me to say.
Okay, so, before we start for real, any questions?
Go ahead.
I have a very important question, and it's a two-parter.
The first part of the question is, "Did a scientist make you in a lab?"
That's not a jock strap, that's a G-string.
Well, well, well, if it isn't Hollywood and the Squares.
Hey, Malcolm, I didn't know you worked at Kmart, and apparently the hair on top of your head didn't know it, either.
What?
- You know, next time, you should use that Chia Pet stuff on your whole head.
- You think you're tough?
- Hey, Malcolm, is that the knife the Indians used to half-scalp you with?
Yo, Crocodile Dumb-dee, how'd it go with the kid?
Kid's in school for one day?
Imagine what he'll do to me.
So you're gonna buy this to cut his head off?
No, I just want him to think I'll cut his head off so then he won't cut my head off.
I love you.
And bring a shovel.
So, my son Bumpty told me he's gonna ask your daughter out on a date at school today.
First of all, my daughter's never been out on a date before, and I'm sure she's not gonna start off with some kid named Bumpty.
You know, beep-beep.
- You.
What are you talking about?
I got in plenty of fights.
Hey, isn't that Cavanaugh right there?
Where?
There's a raft in there?
Who did that?
All right, guys, normally we don't have exciting news this late into the term, but we have a new student joining us today, Braden Higgins.
I want to smash his face.
Screw him.
What does that mean?
I think he's asking you out.
He is?
You are?
I don't make stuff up.
Well, can Donna come?
Who wants to watch me climb a rope?
See, that's why I don't want four kids.
You just start with a burp, then you sniff for a sneeze, you get that going, and that triggers a fart, always.
Where did you hear that?
The Peter Dante who stole your parents' snowmobile and sold it to purchase crack cocaine is dead, Feder.
This side of the law is way better.
Hey, McKenzie, I heard you assaulted somebody in there.
We got five minutes to get to that stupid recital.
You'll get there on time, 'cause we're gonna give you a four-alarm presidential police escort.
So nice of you to invite your friends and the bus driver and the police force to our daughter's dance recital.
Yeah, huge ballet fans, all of them.
I'm having a wonderful time.
She's got a solo?
She moves like "Yagger," no?
Why are your hands shaking, Daddy?
- I don't think I was there.
- You know, all I can remember about this guy is smacking him around whenever I wanted to, and him not doing a single thing about it.
Yeah, we had a lot of good times like that growing up.
Why is your voice so shaky, Daddy?
Are you crying?
You don't stop talking, do you?
I want you to stop making up lies about kicking my ass or I'm gonna have to set you straight.
Sure, sure, sure.
It's a great first job for a kid.
Becky, what do you want, hon?
Can I have the soft chocolate cup, please?
Here's a word you probably never heard, no.
That's where ice cream comes from?
And so we've reached the end of another school year.
F root Loop'?
Ten months of learning, growth and, yes, hopefully, a little bit of fun.
But the journey we began together, in September, does not end today.
For education is a process that does not begin and end on some set schedule...
And this was my favorite shirt from when I was 12!
What?
What's up, man?
How about we do something we're not supposed to?
Heard our dads used to come swimming here, back in the day.
They claim to be all squeaky clean, but I think they were nuts.
No go.
Join the party.
If we don't drink them, they'll be onto us, and I'm not sure I'm ready for beer yet.
Summertime.
You're sure you want to do this, big man?
I had chicken chow mein.
At least we got into college, skinny Danny Glover.
I think it's over.
This just got real.
Guys, this guy's doing 11 flips behind you for some unknown reason.
Dude, why are you acting so crazy?
Did Betty White just call you crazy?
That way.
Come on, are you serious?
You gonna make us jump?
Naked.
Asshole.
You guys are losers.
Don't worry, it gets bigger.
That poor old lady!
Rm Paralyzed!
I was inside you!
What the hell just happened?
I saw my dad's dick.
Damn you!
And why is this kid so angry?
You've been sneaking around with Fabio?
Oh, my God, you gonna jog to Florida after this?
And I promise you I'll stop you and I love you.
When will it end?
Shaw's over, tire.
What happened?
I got a phone call.
Was it long-distance or something?
Don't want to kick a guy while he's down, Higgins, but we caught your son with a can of spray paint looking like he was up to no good.
We are gonna find those fartheads, and we are gonna kill them.
Kill!
We're not killing each other!
Hey, look at these giant mooses out there.
You don't want to get in the middle of all that.
I'm telling you, I've backed down a few times, it's not a good feeling.
All you got to do is put your foot right through the ball.
What did you eat this morning?
All right, this is starting to get into, like, college level.
From the 30!
Who the hell is this kid?
I'm starting to think she has a little crush on you.
Really?
You're late.
You just teach driver's ed.
Hey, officers, you guys want to stick around and have a drink with me, hang out a little bit?
You're afraid of us leaving you alone with your son, aren't you?
So the leg's not really broken, huh?
No, it is broken, right here.
What was once one bone is now two half-bones.
No, I'm not a psychiatrist.
Look, your son is going to be wearing that cast the entire summer.
If you don't mind, I haven't slept in 68 hours.
You can't undo this, and you lied to me, so you're gonna pay for it.
Doctor, wouldn't it be nice if there was a cure for anger?
Another one of your jokes, huh?
I Wish.
Okay, the light is red now, so just remain stopped.
Scully, is that you?
Hey, what's up, fellas?
Are you taking your driver's test drunk?
Yeah, I'm MC Hammered!
Brewski time, dude!
Taking your driver's test while intoxicated?
Minus five points.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
Maybe we go inside and search the Internet for funny videos of squirrels waterskiing.
Okay, we're getting somewhere.
I was looking today.
But no matter who or what we look at, we'll always come back to each other, right?
Hi, girls!
Wash it up extra soapy!
You take these guys, we'll take the yellow car.
Extra soapy.
What is happening right now?
I swear, I didn't plan this.
Why is this never-ending?
At least the guys in the car in front of us are having fun.
What are you doing?
They're not all tens, buddy.
Homeboy, why aren't you eating?
I saw something today that made me lose my appetite.
What was it, me naked?
Basically, he burps, sneezes and farts at the same time.
I think I just shat myself.
Hey, honey, what time's that Feder bash tonight?
I thought it might be fun to have a theme, no?
That was 70 years ago.
Or do you prefer the imaginary shower version?
Used to get 10 cases of beer for my parties, now I get 10 cases of juice boxes.
Is that right?
You must be Roxanne's husband.
Why is that awkward?
Why?
Well, let me give you a hint.
You have brain damage?
I think we both know what time it is, don't we?
What time is it?
Nothing.
What's going on with you and my wife?
I'm gonna go.
What does Penny's note say?
She wrote, "Mayonnaise, zitis..."
The other side.
You have any idea what just happened there?
Not a clue.
You got a customer.
Your father used to do that same three-step crap when we were growing up.
I ain't no boy with a mind you can toy, 'cause if this is a ploy, I'll destroy Illinois.
Well, I sing sometimes, too, but only, like, in the shower.
Sorry to be blunt, but I don't front.
Dinosaur!
How long ago was the '80s?
That was way back in the 1900s.
No way.
Isn't that right, Bowser?
How we doing?
Hey, Dad, why do we have to wear costumes and you don't?
Who's Bruce Springsteen?
I guess some guy with a giant butt.
You don't know who the Boss is?
I stink as a father.
Hey, I'm sorry I raised my voice.
No, honey, honey, honey, if we have another baby, we're starting over, you know?
I'm pregnant.
Our guests are here.
What are you talking about, Prince?
You told me it would be the worst if that happened.
How is that a good thing?
Nice job, Cher.
I'm Oates.
Where's Hall?
Hall's having a playdate with your kids.
How many of you guys have been to a party in the past six months?
A party without a bouncy house.
A party where they actually invited you.
So you pull that triangle and lasagna comes out?
Yeah, good one, that was good.
Don't ever say the party's over!
That didn't happen.
Hey, Richard Simmons is a hero.
You look like Morgan Freeman if he was a transvestite.
Where's your costume?
Come on, you're my one and only, sweetie-boo-mo-mo.
Shut up.
Try to fill it up pharmaceutically, you know, with pills, or the Discovery Channel, or Dino Nuggets.
'Cause you're, I heard, sensitive to men.
God, he's hot!
We just trying to get our punch on.
Well, you wouldn't want to have too much punch with all these kids running around.
Yeah, Mom.
As easy as making a free throw.
I saw it in one of my dreams.
You're a genius?
My boy's a genius.
Your dad's also a genius.
I just want to be alone!
He had a very rough day.
But I'll get him for you, because you need to see him.
Want some Daddy candy right here?
Why are you naked?
Global warming.
Why is this empty?
That is not mine.
You're an animal.
I am the law!
Can you dig it?
This is my dad's party?
Check out your girlfriend in the Pat Benatar outfit.
Your beautiful wife does.
Well, she invited her, and naturally, we assumed it was a plus one.
There a problem?
No, I was gonna say, great Terminator outfit and Robert Palmer thing you got on, and...
What'd you just say?
I said what I said.
Man, looks like our friend's about to die.
Hold my hair, woman.
You ready for this?
Not at all, but I'm gonna do this, 'cause I got to show my son what's right.
- What are you talking about?
Let's get busy, Hollywood!
Yes, I understand you.
Do you understand me?
Yes, I understand you!
Word up.
Hey, guys, if you see Leonard, could you tell him that I'm here waiting like we arranged?
He did, he did, but I had to go With it.
Everybody who needs a beating, conveniently together on one lawn.
Who are they?
Brunson University frat guys.
Oh, God, I hate white people.
Excuse me, why are you here?
What's the matter?
I tell you what is the matter.
Don't try and cover for him, Z-Dog!
Who's Z-Dog?
We know they're trying to get back at us for making them do the naked plunge in our swimming hole.
Apparently, everybody in this crap town has been swimming there since they were eight years old.
I guess nobody wants to leave this dump because they're too busy sucking!
We'll finish later.
Lenny Feder left this town, moved to Hollywood, made big bucks, probably more money than all you brainiacs put together ever will.
We came here to kick some old, smelly ass!
Fellas, we may be old.
But the only ones getting their ass kicked around here is gonna be you spoiled, privileged, uppity, preppy D-bags.
You hear that?
My woman!
You saved me.
I will protect you for the rest of your life.
Okay, blow dryer boy.
Honey, the best.
This!
You're a traitor, Boomer!
That just happened.
What, were you raised by ninjas?
It looks just like you.
It's a monkey!
Good night.
Oops, sorry, I kicked your barrette.
Sorry, honey!
You guys were Fuji and Tanaka out there.
Except for the drunk part, Mommy.
All you guys together brings back so many memories.
Hey, who's this guy?
He's still here.
Someday, Lenny, you won't even remember what life was like with just three children.
Want to talk about the whole pregnancy thing?
I just want to tell you welcome to the family, and I love you very, very, very much.
To be honest, I don't need no stinking ballet teacher.
I'm married to the most beautiful woman in the world, your mommy.
Are you saying sweet things to me because you want to fool around?
That would be a nice way to kick off the summer.
Come on, Sven.
Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on, come on, come on!
This is amazing!
Watch this!
Hi, I'm Olaf, and I like warm hugs.
I love you, Olaf!
Slow down!
Ice?
It's the king.
Do you wanna build a snowman?
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Don't let it show.
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bike around the halls?
It gets a little lonely All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by
See you in two weeks!
Please I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say "Have courage" And I'm trying to
We only have each other It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Why do I have to wear this?
Because the queen has come of age.
Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner.
Me sore eyes can't wait to see the queen and the princess.
Who is it?
Still me, ma'am.
Ready for what?
Who knew we owned 8, 000 salad plates?
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally They're opening up the gates!
The picture of sophisticated grace
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!
Nothing's in my way!
Your Majesty, the gloves.
Princess Anna of Arendelle.
"Hi" me?
Chocolate.
Like an agile peacock.
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.
Why did they shut them in the first place?
Do you know the reason?
Like a chicken with the face of a monkey, I fly.
Let me know when you're ready for another round, milady.
Are you okay?
- It just can't.
Excuse me for a minute.
Your physique helps, I'm sure, too.
What's this?
Twelve older brothers.
And sisters.
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.
But then, one day, she just shut me out, and I never knew why.
I would never shut you out.
All my life has been A series of doors in my face
I mean, it's crazy
Elsa!
I mean, Queen.
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
- Absolutely!
You can if it's true love.
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.
Then leave.
What did I ever do to you?
There she is!
Wait, please!
The fjord.
On my honor.
I leave Prince Hans in charge.
Couldn't keep it in Heaven knows I tried
Conceal, don't feel Don't let them know
And one thought crystallizes Like an icy blast
Let the storm rage on!
The cold never bothered me anyway
Elsa, it's me, Anna, your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer.
Of course, none of it would have happened if she had just told me her secret.
She's a stinker.
Fire!
Big summer blowout.
Half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention, yah?
That would be in our winter department.
The only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear.
You and this fellow.
Big summer blowout.
Carrots.
A real howler in July, yes?
Wherever could it be coming from?
Oh, dear, that's no good.
See, this is from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem.
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem?
I sell ice for a living.
Hi, family.
No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots.
I'm sorry about this violence.
I will add a quart of lutefisk, so we have good feelings.
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?
Reindeers are better than people
Sven, don't you think that's true?
"That's once again true For all, except you"
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.
I don't take people places.
Let me rephrase that.
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.
No, I was raised in a castle.
I got engaged, but then she freaked out, because I'd only just met him, you know, that day.
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
Yes, they did.
"Of the Southern Isles."
- Foot size doesn't matter.
Have you had a meal with him yet?
What if you hate the way he eats?
What if you hate the way he picks his nose?
All men do it.
Wolves?
Excuse me?
Duck!
Jump, Sven!
But I just paid it off.
I'll replace your sled, and everything in it.
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.
Of course I don't want to help her anymore.
You are?
Arendelle.
It's completely frozen.
More like this way.
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
Wait, what am I looking at right now?
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
All right, wait one second.
I love it even more.
All right, let's start this thing over.
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
That's Sven.
Really?
But sometimes I like to close my eyes, and imagine what it would be like when summer does come.
- Don't you dare.
Somebody's gotta tell him.
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.
Treason?
Princess Anna is in trouble.
So, how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?
I am gonna talk to my sister.
So, you're not at all afraid of her?
What now?
Says who?
What are you doing?
I'm going to see my sister.
You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone.
You mean, the love experts?
Yes, the love experts.
Please tell me I'm almost there.
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?
Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you wanted to go.
Now, that's ice.
Flawless.
Why isn't she knocking?
Do you think she knows how to knock?
It opened.
That's a first.
It's me, Anna.
Elsa, you look different.
And you're alive?
I think so.
- No, I'm just trying to protect you.
Please don't shut me out again.
Just stay away And you'll be safe from me
What do I not know?
No, I know we can figure this out together.
To stop me?
Anna, I think we should go.
Heads up!
Watch out for my butt!
This just got a whole lot harder.
I got him!
- What's that for?
That happened.
Man, am I out of shape.
This is not making much of a difference, is it?
That feels better.
Who's my cute little reindeer?
Don't talk to him like that.
Are you okay?
How's your head?
What am I gonna do?
Because I've seen them do it before.
I like to consider myself a love expert.
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.
Kristoff's home!
- Kristoff's home!
Wait, "Kristoff"?
He's napping-
What's going on?
Why are you holding back from such a man?
Is it the clumpy way he walks?
That's nice, but...
Can we please just stop talking about this?
Or that he's socially impaired?
Or that he only likes To tinkle in the woods?
Or the way he covers up That he's the honest goods?
The way to fix up this fixer-upper ls to fix him up with you
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper That's what it's all about
- Wait, what?
She's as cold as ice.
Anna, your life is in danger.
There is ice in your heart put there by your sister.
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.
An act of true love?
A true love's kiss, perhaps?
We are here to find Princess Anna.
Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the queen.
- Do you understand?
The queen.
Queen Elsa!
Don't be the monster they fear you are.
Why did you bring me here?
I couldn't just let them kill you.
Anna has not returned.
You have to tell them to let me go.
I will do what I can.
I'll meet you guys at the castle!
It's Princess Anna!
Are you gonna be okay?
Don't worry about me.
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.
What happened out there?
Elsa struck me with her powers.
She froze my heart, and only an act of true love can save me.
A true love's kiss.
You said you did.
As 13th in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance.
I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.
You won't get away with this.
I already have.
Please, somebody, help.
It's getting colder by the minute.
If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.
At least we got to say our marriage vows before she died in my arms.
What is it, buddy?
I don't understand you when you talk like that.
She's with her true love.
Help.
But don't touch it.
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?
But we ran all the way here.
Do you happen to have any ideas?
Kristoff loves me?
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?
Just maybe not right this second.
Don't worry, I've got it.
I know why!
Look out!
Back this way.
We're trapped.
Slide, Anna!
We made it!
Go, go, go!
Come on, buddy, faster.
Good boy.
Elsa?
I love you.
"An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart."
"Love will thaw."
Love!
I knew you could do it.
My own personal flurry!
The only frozen heart around here is yours.
I will return this scoundrel to his country.
We shall see what his 12 big brothers think of his behavior.
Arendelle thanks you, milord.
I owe you a sled.
No, I can't accept this.
Like it?
Summer!
Are you ready?
'You don't need his approval,' you just want it.
What's the difference?
Well, most of what we call "needs" are desires.
We need air to breathe, water, warmth, food to eat.
And speaking of which...
The rest - love, approval, recognition, praise, whatever - they're desires.
So, then you do want marriage in the end?
I didn't know you were so conventional!
There's a province somewhere in China where the Mosuo people live.
The head of the family is a mother or grandmother and she controls the family's finances.
I have to take this.
'We don't want this to turn into an international custody battle.'
'We can talk it through then.
I should go.
It's Friday night.
Seems I have work to do.
What are you doing?
I've just got you a drink.
That's the plan.
I'm calling the police!
Police officers!
We're entering with weapons drawn!
If anyone is in the house, make your presence known immediately.
Alpha-Papa-1-0 to Uniform.
Checking the rear area now.
Police officer.
Daddy?
Where have you been?
Why?
To get some headache pills.
I've just been five minutes.
What's in your bag?
Just some stuff from the shop.
I tried to ring Mummy, but I got her number wrong.
I'm sorry.
I promise I won't go and leave you again, OK?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
With me?
No, no, with me.
Kiss Mac.
Oh, my God!
Is that yours too?
And you didn't just leave these things on the bed yourself?
Where have you been this evening, Sarah?
Out with some colleagues in the city centre.
And what do you do for a living?
I'm a solicitor.
And you've been drinking?
Just some wine.
How much wine, Sarah?
No sign of forced entry.
Who else has keys to the house?
My sister, she has keys.
Um, I don't know.
I see you have a cat?
Is anything missing?
Where was the underwear kept?
Er, the underwear is here in these top two drawers.
The other thing is in the bedside cabinet drawer.
'Loft is clear.'
It's a client.
Isn't it rather late for that?
I really appreciate you coming, but I need to sleep.
If you're worried you should stay with a family member, a friend.
Yeah, yeah, I'll call my sister.
Just make sure you don't drive anywhere.
We've checked the premises and surrounding area.
No intruder located.
We've given assurances we'll pay passing attention throughout the night.
What?
That's her excuse, what's yours?
You could have warmed my side for me.
Why would I do that?
You horrible man.
Stella.
Nice to see you.
Armoured car, Jim?
Welcome to Belfast.
Policing is political here, Stella.
And it isn't at the Met?
The victim's ex-father-in-law is a Unionist MP.
We have nothing, Stella.
The killer is out there somewhere and we have nothing at all.
This is Detective Superintendent Gibson.
She's seen your file, so I'll let you make your own introductions.
Is there anything you need?
I'll risk a cup.
Can of Coke he had the day before is still sitting there.
You know at first they thought it was a virus?
You've told him before.
Gave him paracetamol.
By the time they put him on antibiotics, it was too late.
The boy told the doctors he felt better.
He'd have said anything to be allowed to go home!
Are you eating?
Not really.
How are things in the bedroom?
And made prints.
Three other people are living because of him.
A little boy regained his sight because of our Daniel.
That's something.
It's almost like he's still living.
Somewhere his heart is beating.
Come in.
Come in, Jerry.
I've been brought in from the Metropolitan Police to lead a review into the investigation of the murder of Alice Monroe.
We will, in time, read all documentation relating to the inquiry.
To that end, I will need your policy book and your action book.
Any questions?
I feel so alone.
Have you anything to say, Jimmy?
Useless waste of space.
Men and women express grief differently, Liz.
Try not to make comparisons.
How long am I going to feel like this, Paul?
How things are in the bedroom is none of your fucking business!
I'm sorry if you're uncomfortable with the question.
"Uncomfortable" doesn't even begin to cover it!
And my son has paid the price.
Your son had bacterial meningitis, Jimmy.
An illness, that's all.
Don't you believe in God?
Jimmy, let me go.
Answer me.
I have seen angels ascending and descending Jacob's Ladder.
Is that what you want to hear?
It makes no odds what I believe, Jimmy.
What kind of name is Spector, anyway?
That explains a lot.
Daddy, look what I found!
Where did you get that?
You're not supposed to pick things.
Come on.
I've been thinking, who might still have keys?
Oh, gosh, you're heavy!
Oh, it's the best smell in the world.
There's no evidence of any defensive wounds.
Maybe, she was... ..too fearful, or thought cooperation would make things better, or he overpowered her so she didn't have a chance to fight back.
The pathologist reports extensive petechial haemorrhages that suggest that the killer tightened and loosened his grip around her throat over a period of 45 minutes to an hour.
When was this?
Three months ago?
It was felt at the time, still is, as far as I know, that the killer was known to the victim.
She had, at the time of her death, more than one boyfriend.
He remains the prime suspect, I believe.
White professional woman?
A teacher at the university.
In her early thirties?
Posed after death?
Only if you call being stuffed in the bedroom closet "posed".
What was her name?
Fiona Gallagher.
I mean what is it, £20 a dance?
It's your fault for getting caught - you should have destroyed the evidence.
Yeah, it is.
It was on the floor.
Oh, um, thank you so much.
Four hours?
Thank you.
Paul will walk you home.
What sort of singer?
I posted a couple of clips online.
Oh, no, I'm not telling YOU that.
If you want to see them, you're going to have to work at it.
That was months ago.
I've had my braces removed.
Thank you for walking me home.
Hey, are you asleep?
Did you tell her that she wouldn't grow if she didn't sleep all night through?
You need to be careful what you say to her.
She's been having night terrors for months.
What I said has nothing to do with it.
I just wish I knew what was going on in her mind when she's like that.
No-one knows what's going on in someone else's mind.
And life would be intolerable if we did.
I hope I'm not keeping you from church.
Already been.
'I brought you in to progress the Monroe investigation.'
You need a new and substantial line of inquiry and linking these two murders would give you one.
It was treated as a self-solver from the off and I think that's wrong.
The postmortem interval puts the time of death at an hour before she was discovered.
She called her boyfriend and told him she was going out with friends.
He came home after work at 1.30 in the morning, assumed that she was still out and called her.
Her phone rang in the closet.
He went to look and found her stuffed inside, dead.
Now one possibility is that the killer was still with her when the boyfriend came home and disturbed him.
So he shoved her in the cupboard and fled.
I just don't buy it.
This would account for the three months between this murder and the killing of Alice Monroe.
It didn't go as planned with... with Gallagher and it spooked him.
And so when he struck again he made sure that he did it right.
Two professional women in their early 30s, killed in their own homes by strangulation.
I mean, look, they could be sisters.
The strangulation marks are different.
Yes, the marks might be different but both of them have extensive petechial haemorrhages which indicates that he strangled them, released and then strangled again, over and over.
So now you're adding torture into the mix?
No, thank you.
It's amazing how quickly your hand tires.
Stop for God's sake.
I mean, how long was that?
30 seconds?
Go back to your review, Stella.
I don't want the two murders linked.
Yes?
We need you down here.
What's up?
Daddy, look.
Look, Daddy, look!
How did it go with Burns?
He didn't buy it.
Maybe just as well.
Recommend increasing technical support staff.
Failure to see that crimes are linked - linkage blindness, it's the thing that will allow the killer to strike again.
We refuse to recognise the series and he carries on regardless.
I didn't sell it hard enough, Garrett.
'I'm off.'
The babies I look after are too small to cry.
Crying would be great, crying means they're getting better.
Maybe you should visit me at work sometime.
Maybe I should.
Say goodnight to the kids.
Good night, you two.
Mummy, I need you!
Is it Glen?
Who's that?
Introduce us.
What's going on, Sergeant?
We found guns and arrested three men.
Just waiting on the dogs.
Explosives?
Will the review take long?
A week, maybe more.
I'm staying at the Hilton.
Very nice.
Room 203.
Good luck with your arrests.
Robberies where items of underwear were taken?
Sarah Kay.
We should have moved her out of there, put her in a hotel, called in CSIs.
Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson?
Not even off the record?
There's no such thing, as you well know.
Did I invite you to sit down?
I don't think so.
So, call the police.
How did you find me here?
It's a small city, Stella.
Oh, gosh, you really are a journalist, aren't you?
So, why bring someone in from the outside?
That looks remarkably like a vote of no confidence in the PSNI and its ability to run an internal murder investigation review, don't you think?
What have you found so far?
Staggering levels of incompetence?
Mr Callan, no-one knows better than me how important the media is as an investigative resource.
You have my card.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
Nothing.
'I'm calling from outside your house.
'If you're there, it is the police at the door.
'I was hoping to speak with you to follow up on the incident 'that occurred on Friday.
'Please, ring the number I gave you when you get this message.'
Perhaps she did go stay with her sister.
It was quite a night you had out in 433 Friday, Mr. Pullman.
They brought me back.
How'd they pull that off?
Cardio-cerebral resuscitation.
Can you tell me about ouroboros?
Where'd you hear that?
Something you mentioned repeatedly.
Can you tell me its significance... to you?
Where does the soul go?
That's why they killed us.
But this... it's not right.
It's not right that now we have to see these things.
Nice one, jerks.
You gave me a real scare there.
She sure looks real.
Baby, you sure look a little pale.
- Do you need... mouth to mouth?
You sure have pretty lips.
Who else is gonna die?
Good morning.
Thank you.
So, how was it?
What?
Something was out there.
A scent.
Of what?
Milk-Bone?
Something bad.
Scout's honor.
The turn, it really takes it out of him.
Coffee?
School.
Right.
Roman, Scout's honor.
Sweet boy.
This is one of the only rivers in the world that flows north.
It confuses the birds.
Long story.
Stupid-ass birds!
Are you OK?
We're in this together.
Holy fuck!
Tom.
- Something on your mind?
- I got an odd call this morning from the state psychiatric board inquiring about Pullman's condition.
You don't get that kind of call without a push.
The only folks around here with that kind of clout are your friends at the White Tower.
I don't have friends at the Tower.
Right.
Look, I'm probably over-thinking it, but... you know, you did me a hell of a favor, and I thought you deserved a heads-up.
I appreciate that.
God damn it.
He wants you to be strong.
Are you leaving?
I want to make morning mass.
Why do I do this to myself?
All you know how to do is take.
This from an Irishman?
I think you know my attitude towards father figures.
Do you have any idea of the risk of hypertension for men my age?
You need some help getting up on that cross, or did you bring a ladder?
I hear Michael's in town.
I heard the same thing.
Just ask.
The feeling is mutual.
So there's nothing for me to worry about?
If there was something for you to worry about, you'd know before either of us did.
If that's a no, that's good to hear.
[This is Car 2 responding to the wild animal report at, uh, Hastings and 3rd.]
[We've got some scared people downtown today.]
That it has.
Sheriff?
I'm from Fish and Wildlife Service.
Dr. Chasseur.
Sheriff Sworn.
Sorry to hear that.
People in town are scared.
They should be.
Bite patterns indicate it's the same animal, but the body's left out there too long to tell what species.
What you see is what we found at the scene.
Given the lack of evidence of violent struggle, the body's condition of exsanguination... we are to believe that the animal deposited her here?
It seems that way.
Yet leaving no trail to the site of the actual killings.
As with the Bluebell killing, no tracks were discovered at the scene.
Well, it's a good thing I'm wearing sensible shoes.
Did you do it fast or slow?
Grunt once for "fast".
Dude, now you're being a dick.
But seriously, who's next?
Kiss him.
What?
Everyone's scared shitless.
Are you sure it wasn't you?
It wasn't me.
I know.
Vargulf.
A wolf will only attack if it's hungry or if it's provoked-- if it's normal.
A vargulf is a wolf that's gone insane.
Insane how?
It doesn't eat what it kills.
You sure that's what this is?
How?
You can tell a whole life by a scent--sex, health, fucking needs.
Is it someone you know?
I never knew any others except Nicolae.
So, I guess we find him now.
Why?
To make him stop.
Have you heard of the Order of the Dragon?
It was a group of knights from the Crusades.
My mom used to tell stories.
I've always wanted to be a warrior.
I see things sometimes.
I hear these whispers, but I don't always know if they're real or not.
Weird.
There are no tracks... aside from what I take are your tracking dogs.
Soft pads clipped nails.
Isn't that what we said?
No, you said none were found.
A real tracker can trace a man's steps through a city from a helicopter.
I can tell you a girl under a hundred pounds came from that direction at a relaxed pace, ran off in a state of distress.
- How do you know Caucasian?
- It's Pennsylvania.
What I can't tell you is what kind of animal left Lisa Willoughby here or what direction it came from.
Of course, there's been nearly a week for the tracks to degrade, but... we're still talking about an animal of sufficient size to drag a 60-pound load an unknown distance.
And that... officers... is very weird.
In your experience, why would an animal do that?
In my experience, it wouldn't.
Kind of goes against the grain of being a predator.
My cat drags creatures home all the time.
It's not your turn to talk when you're not holding the retard stick.
He's right.
The only logical motive for it to be left here is if it was meant to be discovered.
A trophy.
I'm sorry... what kind of animal has a motive?
It's necessary for a predator to anticipate the evasions of its prey in advance, requiring a basic theory of mind.
So one that's capable of empathy.
Hey.
Hey, you home?
The gynecologist.
You there?
Yeah.
Do you want to get lunch at the club?
She has irises.
And yes, I know I'm being a feminist in calling her "she".
I wonder what color her eyes are.
I think I need some air.
Got a happy hour?
Just missed it.
Yeah, he's here.
Yeah, well, hey, this is what you wanted to do, so-- Yeah, it's what you wanted to do.
I've bathed in the flames of Ishtar and Babylon and danced for Diana in Corinth.
It's OK to laugh.
I'm assuming this is your first time.
Yeah, you could say that.
But, before we get to the fun stuff, I have to ask one question.
This is a pure process which involves channeling mysterious and powerful forces that put me in personal danger.
The vargulf is dangerous but short-lived.
So he's gonna kill again.
This isn't mild-mannered Bruce Banner.
This is Norman Bates.
Just... stay out of the way and let nature take its course.
Have you been sniffing rubber cement?
Why are you talking like this?
I'm just saying, if we knew who it was.
There's this upir.
I would know if he was bullshitting me.
I don't know, he's... trying to be the good guy or something.
What the fuck are you and an upir having a heart-to-heart about good guys and bad guys for?
Do you think I'm just blood capsules and parlor tricks?
He knows.
How much does he know?
He was there for the last turn.
I certainly wasn't.
We have the same dreams.
I had a dream about that the other night.
Oh, my god.
Run before it's too late for you.
Two girls brutally mauled and killed.
Now Hemlock Grove police are asking the public to report any unusual activity...
Good-looking girls.
Why don't you move over there?
There's a kids' section, so, you know... nice spot.
Well, you're too close.
Whatever he's having, on me.
In fact, another round for the house.
No.
Nobody needs your fucking money.
Why don't you tell your brother to be a fuckin' man, huh?
Come on, darling.
Do you remember the story I used to tell you of the Emperor Moth?
Just a little thing.
A naturalist once came upon the cocoon of this rare creature, just as it was struggling to emerge in its new form.
He watched as it writhed and labored terribly to shed its shell.
Unable to witness such a thing of beauty suffer so... the man produced a blade and cut it free.
He cradled the new moth, waiting for it to spread its fine wings.
Hate me if you must, but you are an emperor.
Hey there.
- Hi, Tom.
About the dead girl.
What are you a doctor of?
Predatorothology.
So you're like Hannibal Lecter but for animals?
Yeah, I suppose you could think of it that way.
Is it weird that this is your job when you're a girl?
It just seemed way more important to me than girl stuff, you know?
But aren't faith and science basically irreconcilable?
Yeah... it can sure feel that way sometimes.
I'm sorry if this is upsetting to you, but you are the only person who encountered the area in an uncorrupted condition.
So... do you remember seeing any paw prints?
- Any dragging marks in the leaves?
Gotta run.
You know the drill.
Short and sweet, OK?
Peter Rumancek?
Yes?
Yes, sir.
I'd shake your hand, but they seem to be occupied.
Well, you'd have to tell me what "hirsute" means, ma'am.
It means, and forgive me for saying, but, uh, furry.
Peter, I'm Dr. Chasseur.
I'm a special agent with the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
Around, I suppose.
I don't suppose you are by any chance a werewolf, Peter?
Can I possibly ask why, ma'am--
Do you know Christina Wendell?
Yes, sir.
You know she was the one who discovered Lisa Willoughby?
Well, because I told her, ma'am.
Any particular reason you told her?
Because she asked me.
Any particular reason she asked?
My middle and index finger are the same length.
This is an attribute of werewolfism?
Well, she seemed to think so, ma'am, but I'm really not an expert on the whole thing.
So you continue to deny all werewolf allegations.
I thought it was a scientific fact, ma'am.
Proving a negative is misuse of both the term "science" and "fact",
But I thought it was just this close to scientific fact, ma'am.
Well, it takes all kinds to make a world, ma'am.
Did you know either Lisa Willoughby or Brooke Bluebell?
We were catching fireflies, ma'am.
Does Roman Godfrey think he's a werewolf?
Well, you know where to find us.
What are you gonna do?
We can't leave.
It's Peter.
We share the same English class.
And this is in regard to...?
It doesn't end well for him.
It's Peter.
Yeah, well, nice to meet you, Peter.
You have a caller.
Yeah?
We need to talk.
Yeah, well, maybe this is something you should be discussing with your guidance counselor, huh?
Maybe I will.
All right, this woman is what she says she is like a Mexican hates fireworks.
What is she?
The only people who really know what you are are your mom and me.
Nicolae.
What?
Nicolae was a killer.
He killed one of our own.
What, she's gonna dig up a body 5,000 miles and 70 years away?
Who do you think this Chasseur really is?
It's too late for me to run now.
So, what, then?
We do what you said.
We find the vargulf and we stop him.
- How?
I kill him.
You would do that?
I would do what was necessary.
Where would we start?
Lisa Willoughby.
Seems like a bit of a dead end, don't you think?
We're gonna dig her up.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Pullman?
Frances.
Dad.
No.
Why don't you come over here?
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm gonna stay safe.
I seen it.
What... what did you see, Frances?
I seen the thing inside her.
The thing inside your little girl.
Animals.
Well, I hate to be a bother, but I've recently heard reports of trespassers around the mill building-- reports just confirmed.
Urban explorers or some such nonsense.
Yes, that would be fine.
What if Destiny was wrong?
- What if the moon hits your eye?
- What if it was an e-vite?
I never called us the Order of the Dragon.
What's with this guy?
Gross.
How old's your mom, anyway?
Why don't you ask her that?
What if they don't leave?
Can I help you?
This isn't a good time.
Mr. Willoughby.
You're exhausted.
You should really take a nap.
In case you were wondering, cops call this shit breaking and entering.
Was it ever gonna be anything else?
Does that hurt?
All right, let's just do this and get out of here.
In here.
Cool.
Why?
- Are you the ones that dug up my sister?
Mom's taking Gary to be put down.
- What?
- Gary.
Mom can't handle having a dog around.
And Dad, he can't handle the thought of having the dog Lisa loved so much being with new owners.
Seems like a bit much for a Boston terrier, don't you think?
It does.
I thought it was an invitation to a rave, so I begged her to take me, but she wouldn't.
So I looked at her, so fucking pretty, and I said that I hope she ends up in a dumpster.
OK.
I already showed it to my parents.
'Cause when we find him, he's going to be joining Gary.
I need to know if you're taking this as seriously as I am.
My name is on this.
This thing put my name on this.
Your family's name.
This matters to me as much as it matters to you.
But if you end up in jail, you better reconsider that hair.
I'm just saying.
Man, I try not to fuckin' think about it.
What's up?
Oh, Lynda.
She needs some help back at home.
Water heater or some shit.
What, is that a problem?
Man's gotta do...
Yeah, Tyler's gonna love that white streak.
I think your hair's really pretty the way it is.
It's what's different about you that's gonna make him remember you.
We really don't need a third.
- Did that cunt just say that?
- That cunt just totally said that.
One for sorrow, two for joy, three for girl, four for boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be... told.
- Remember, Shelley, the cruelty of children is easily ignored.
I finally tracked it down at UT-- only college in the world with a library of Romany studies.
Rarely.
Well, thank you for your... efforts.
Thank you.
So, I did some more digging.
I asked my dad like a million questions about Aunt Olivia--
Peanut butter and lime yogurt mixed together with gummy bears and extra MMs.
Bite?
I mean, I don't know what picture of Dorian Gray you have to hide away for your butt to look as good as Olivia's at her age.
Can you imagine?
Besides, abstinence is way overrated.
What, you don't think she's hot?
Not my type.
And he's a liar.
There was a girl before Roman and Shelley.
Her name was Juliet.
She died as an infant.
Died how?
But in the end it was JR who totally lost his grip.
I guess he made some pretty wild accusations about her.
Like what?
Do you have any idea what it might have said?
I don't know.
I got from the look on his face that it was time to change the subject.
How much do you think Roman knows about where Olivia came from?
Isn't that a better question to ask Roman?
You keep thinkin', Butch.
It's what you're good at.
So, I'm thinking the Rag Bone scuba skinnies with, like, a tunic top.
Better check that fetus for Lyme ticks is all I'm saying.
- Where are you going?
- Don't you know them?
People suck.
Such a talent.
His French verse far more nuanced than his native German.
No one described the inanimate as beautifully as good old Rainer.
Let me ask you a question.
Do you think you pose a risk to yourself or to others?
You're gonna send me back out there.
You don't wanna go?
Yeah, the fuck you did.
Well, tell me more about what you see.
It's things that... that aren't right.
What kind of things?
The baby in the blood pouch.
The river glowing red.
A needle the size of a sword.
This needle, was it... some kind of drug?
This isn't about goddamn drugs.
This is some evil, unnatural shit that's got no business happening.
And I just want to help... someone.
Excuse me, Dr. Godfrey, you have an urgent phone call.
Feeling better?
Shelley, give Mommy a moment.
Do look more inconvenienced, Norman.
It's terribly flattering.
Why don't you drink this electrolytes concoction?
You're probably just dehydrated.
No hospital.
It was not unpleasant.
Do you understand?
No one's expecting more, darling.
What'd I just tell you?
Must be a terrible blow to your ego.
I am gonna call a cab and I'll wait at the corner.
You will do no such thing.
Do be civilized, for Christ's sake.
What's the worst thing you think can happen from waiting inside?
I have to go.
Mm, yes, yes, you've said that.
Olivia, was this staged?
As though I would leverage my health and my daughter's safekeeping as a snare for your attention.
You, um, you've been taking the pills?
What bloody business is that of yours?
Well, it is my bloody business if you make it.
Not because I want you to.
Why didn't you call me?
I'm... very tired.
Uh, be a dear and run your uncle back to wherever, would you?
Come on, Uncle.
Is she really OK?
I don't know.
Psychotic?
So, yeah.
Would you tell me if you did?
Yeah.
I'm watching out for her.
Good.
Good.
- We got some frozen yogurt.
Stay frosty.
It was just a ride home.
Got a flashlight?
Your text said, and I quote,
"Hey, you wanna check out the matinee of Section 5 tomorrow?
- I hear it's amazing."
Well, you're on a date with a dork, so what does that make you?
I'll get back to you.
You should expect to receive an offer soon from a firm called Lod, LLC.
I'm getting an offer?
To buy you out.
"Well, you ordered the wrong paint for the nursery."
Thanks.
You are safe.
Remembering you are safe is a positive coping strategy.
Like a fucking pimp.
Nobody gives a shit what happens out here.
Except us, right?
You ever see this place when it was running?
My old man closed it before I was born.
Lots of people died here-- workers and shit.
You know when you close your ears, sometimes the sound of your heart is like a little man walking through snow.
Hey, what was that, uh, big structure that was outside?
It's a Bessemer converter.
At one point, they made pig iron into money.
Do we have any idea what we may be looking for?
Uh... driver's license, social security card, dream journal...
I'll go this way.
- You find anything?
No.
Let's go.
I mean, it's... pretty much just big and empty and gross-- except for this, like, giant, like, black... cauldron thing they used to make steel in.
They call it a Bessemer.
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Looks like a big black egg with a hole at the top.
It's still there, but now it's on its side, supposedly... you know, cursed or whatever because it crushed someone, and all his guts and intestines spilled out of his mouth, and he was alive all the while, and he was choking on it and...
Oh, my god.
I wanted to check it out, you know?
Well, you know, just... gathering material.
You're gonna be an amazing writer.
I hope so.
Do you?
Feeling better?
You summoned.
What's Pryce up to?
It won't happen while I'm alive.
Darling, you're looking at me like I'm supposed to argue something that's none of my goddamn business.
Well, someone had to approve the new obstetrics wing.
Simply an option if she doesn't prefer to give birth in a manger.
First I've heard of it.
- In my experience, people believe what they wish regardless of your encouragement.
Have we exhausted the reasons you can pretend you called me here?
- Is it OK?
For the nursery.
No VOC.
You hear that?
What the fuck is that?
It's... it's Lisa Willoughby.
I'd like to go.
- Who the fuck comes in here?
- I don't know.
Should we tell someone?
Tell them what?
I dunno.
Shit!
I'll deal with it.
You've made your point.
Where?
What are you talking about?
They're gonna find your car.
I don't like secrets.
XK Douchebag.
Just get rid of them.
Please!
Since you said the magic word.
Fuck.
Well, oily, oily, oxen free.
Yeah, what does that say?
We know what it says.
I was actually jacking off to French postcards of your mother, and, uh, would prefer a little privacy.
Our mistake.
Everyone knows fuck-face doesn't have any friends.
Yes?
Mm, yes, this is.
No, no, no.
Where are the keys?
What are you doing?
How lovely she is.
So much of her mother.
Do not be afraid.
I am here to take you to a good life.
A life that you were born to.
Here.
Elizabeth Murray!
Bring yourself back here this very moment!
Her mother is dead.
That is simply impossible.
What is right...can never be impossible.
She is black.
A detail you chose not to share with us.
It is not in my gift to question the King and his Royal Navy.
Do you have in mind my position, my reputation?
Have some sense of propriety, boy, and understand what it is you are asking.
She is a mulatto.
What has she been named?
Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay.
She takes your name?
I am not ashamed.
We will call her Dido.
Good Lord, she is thin.
Mary, find her some food.
Sweet child.
Aship is no place for one so precious as you.
In these walls yours will be a life equal to my blood.
And you will not understand in this moment but know in your heart you are loved.
Just as I loved your mother.
Papa M?
You should not always insist on speaking your mind, you know.
You'll end up an old maid, with only your own company as entertainment.
Like you, Aunt Mary?
That's what the maids say.
Oh, you little...
Just wait till I catch you.
Elizabeth, come back here this moment!
There's one of me, too.
Would you like to see it?
Elizabeth's papa?
Yes, that's right.
You're very sharp.
Born on English soil.
Indeed.
He discovered her mother aboard a captured Spanish slave ship.
So...now we have 2 nieces in our guardianship.
Well, Elizabeth was in much need of a companion.
And that is what we shall say when questions are asked.
We shall say that, in accordance with her birthright she is entitled to live beneath this roof.
That is the nature of order.
And where in that order should her color be placed?
Above or below her Murray bloodline?
Marriage?
Any match her 'other origins' would attract would surely disgrace her and the family's rank.
And when we are no longer here?
No husband... who will take care of her then?
Girls!
I have no experience in the ways of breaking grave news to you.
I had thought I should one day have the opportunity to make his better acquaintance.
Yes.
Yes, I know.
£2,000 a year?
Then you are an heiress.
He has left you your fortune.
My father's new wife wishes him to leave me not a thing and he obliges her.
I think he might have loved me more if mama had not died.
With such a dowry, you may marry into any good family you wish.
We shall be receiving visitors for dinner.
Visitors?
Whoever bothers to visit us here?
Or leave, except the dead.
Once again, Dido?
We should prepare some extra beds in case our visitors are to stay.
Say we may wear them, Aunt Mary.
You will not be dining with us, Dido.
Of course.
But I mayjoin after dinner, may I not?
Papa, how may I be too high in rank to dine with the servants and too low to dine with my family?
Dinner with guests is a formal proceeding, Dido.
We simply can't impose upon visitors our disregard of those formalities.
But...am I not wealthy now?
Finance may go some way but society has a habit of disregarding even one of its own when opportunity provides.
But after dinner, when formality is of less consequence well... your presence can raise no defendable objections.
As you wish...sir.
I would rather dine with Dido.
Young gentlemen?
Very good connections.
There shall be no discussion tonight in any language but English.
No whispering in gentlemen's ears, not in Latin, Italian and certainly not in French.
I must say, the entire country barely breathes awaiting yourjudgment on the Zong appeal.
Terrified you will destroy England, no doubt.
I know Lord Ashford is.
He does wonder, however, what might be taking you so long.
The law, Lady Ashford, it is to be interpreted not merely administered.
Your husband, of all people, knows this.
Oh, what a lot of fuss over dead cargo.
It is a fuss over the bread and butter of a great many people in this country, Lady Ashford.
Why, what wonderful French.
Though I have not an idea of what you said.
There are poachers wandering.
Good evening to you.
Sir, I do not believe we have been introduced.
Indeed.
Please inform the lady of my apologies for startling her.
Sir?
You shall not interrupt him at dinner.
Immediately after dinner, sir.
Dido, my dear.
Papa?
Good Lord, it's the negro.
She really is...
I had no idea she would be so...black.
Did you not listen to the rumors when you were spreading them, Mama?
A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.
James is the eldest.
To inherit the entire Ashford fortune.
He's also to inherit from his uncle a healthy man, who shows little sign of departure.
She is intriguing, is she not?
I find her repulsive.
Well, I suppose she is... if you find a most rare and exotic flower so.
He has much to recommend him.
And a second fortune in life should please any wife.
One samples it on the cotton fields of the Indies.
Why so far when it is right at my door?
Good Lord, they are appraising me.
Then find a pure English rose to decorate one's home.
Is she 'out'?
Not quite.
Any day now.
You will refrain from any intercourse with the negro.
They may find it fascinating to have a Lady mulatto running around in their house but I will not have one running around in mine.
It is said her father left her a rather vast fortune.
I mean to say, if that is your incfinafion.
Where do you get your information?
Her sister-cousin has a rather fast tongue.
And what of you, Miss Lindsay?
Are we to hear you play tonight?
Well...
Papa?
Oh, do not be selfish with your good fortune, m'Lord.
This will be most interesting.
She's never played in company.
She is...most accomplished.
Hers was a most diligent governess.
His family name will no doubt induce her to take him seriously.
She must not delude herself.
Such decisions are not hers to make.
Well, then spell it out to her before she renders herself sport to some 'gent' of cruel promises.
That at least is true.
It is Elizabeth who must secure her bread and butter.
A portrait?
Are you sure?
Good Lord, how truly wonderful.
But...
But what?
Papa, should he not have wished to see me before deciding?
Sorry, I did not know you...
Mr. Davinier, I believe you've already had the pleasure.
Decide what?
If he should... should want to paint me.
The man is to be paid a fortune.
Not a very challenging task.
Next to Elizabeth?
As you always are, right beside each other.
Should not any lady be flattered to be such a subject?
You may take the books back to the library.
Upon the death of her husband, a widow may receive her marriage portion and her inheritance at once.
She has 40 days to leave her husband's home.
Mr. Davinier, what is the purpose of the law, in your eyes?
To provide certainty where there otherwise might be none.
Example?
The Zong ship and those drowned.
The law is one of the few trades acceptable to a gentleman.
One day, yes, my Lord.
I wish to make the laws, for that is how I may truly change this world.
You have grand ambitions.
Well if I may, my Lord, neither did you.
I beg your pardon?
Well as a fourth son you had rank but not the income to pay for your quafificafion to the Inns.
Without the sponsorship of Lord Foley and William Hamilton the English courts might not have benefited from your brilliance and the title Lord Chief Justice could not be yours today...my Lord.
And you think you are worthy of such considerations?
Of that I do not know, my Lord, but I do know that a country life does not suit me.
Dido the Reverend Davinier has asked me to take his son under my tutelage.
What do you think?
Thank you for your gracious support.
I neither spoke for or against you since neither is my place.
Silence speaks volumes.
Papa's new student.
A pleasure.
Papa has never taken a pupil, you realize?
Someone to keep you company while you take papa's dictation, Dido.
Truth is, there have been more men here this week than I've seen in my entire life.
Hopefully we have not disappointed.
On the contrary.
Mr. Davinier, what what is the importance of the Zong?
Why is the case before papa's court, the Supreme Court?
Well it is a ship.
I am aware of that.
It is...a human cargo ship.
It...it lost most of its slaves before arriving at its destination.
Drowned by the crew, on the captain's orders.
But...why?
Miss, your supper is served now in the ladies' parlor.
Thank you.
Will you be joining us for dinner, Mr. Davinier?
Thank you, madam, but I am promised to the company of my aunt this evening.
Very well, as you wish.
Permit me to ask, but why do you not dine with your family ever?
That is not correct.
Forgive me but twice now I have seen you separated from the gathering.
I am confounded.
And well you might be when the son of clergy is permitted to the table before a lady of the house.
Is that a reminder of my place?
No. it is a statement of mine.
132 drowned en route from Africa to the West Indies.
Your ruling could bring the slave trade to its knees entirely destroying an economic foundation of this land.
Is that pressure not maddening, my Lord?
"Letjustice be done, though the heavens may fall."
But is that where it hinges?
No man happily disposes of his cargo.
Swallow financial ruin or seek recompense from your insurer?
With due respect I should question whether human life should be insurable as cargo at all.
A gentleman rather like him once showed me great interest.
Mr. Davinier?
Really, Mary?
Well, don't look at me like that.
It was my mama who intervened.
I thought he had a very great sense of duty.
A little over-kind at times but...
He is engaged, you know?
Is he engaged.?
Mr. Beresford's daughter.
The carriage-maker?
He might have set his sights a little higher.
Hymn number 76.
Mr. Davinier.
Wait.
I was curious.
I appear the only one to have just learned of the Zong case.
Perhaps yours is a life less concerned with such matters.
Why do you judge me so?
It is a fact that I have contemplated on the matter for many hours and I I do not think the slaves could have been drowned in the way that you say.
Are you at utter disconnect from everything?
Mr. Davinier, please.
Tell me what you know.
Tell me.
Do not render me your amusement.
I can only tell you what I believe.
And what...what is that?
The slaves were thrown into the waters chained together as one.
They were diseased worth more as dead insured merchandise, than as alive spoiled goods.
Miss Lindsay...
But the insurers are appealing?
They are refusing to pay for murdered slaves.
Thank you.
You told her they were wantonly drowned?
They were diseased, but it was essential that they die on the journey or they would not come under the insurance consideration.
You have taken advantage ofconfidenfial matters afforded you.
These 'matters' have been for public consumption for months.
Miss Lindsay is no child...no fool.
Her precious care is in my hands and I will decide when she is ready for such realities not the son of a vicar!
Your Lordship, a question.
Well?
As the mere son of a vicar I wonder whether the value you extend to your very precious mulatto niece amounts to the £30 insurance the traders are asking for each life they murdered?
Good day, my Lord.
Mr. Davinier find yourself in her vicinity again and I will make you rue the day you ever set eyes on me.
John Davinier is leaving very early today.
There you are.
We are requested.
We are to attend London for the season.
We are to finally 'come out'?
Elizabeth is to come out.
Dido is not.
But...why?
You understand the ways of the world for a female, Dido.
Elizabeth has no income.
You are to meet as many gentlemen as possible before we make the match.
When all this has gone to her father, there'll be nothing left for her.
And...me?
Any gentleman of good breeding would be unlikely to form a serious attachment to Dido.
And a man without would lower her position in society.
She's not merely my cousin, Mama.
Papa, please.
She is my sister.
These are the keys of the house.
I cannot attend London without her.
They have hung at your aunt's waist for 30 years.
Lady Mary is too old to continue in charge of the house.
You may take up your duties on your return.
Lord knows I'll need the two of you to keep each other out of trouble.
Are you punishing me?
Punishing you?
I'm so very sorry.
Do you think I may see Mr. James in town?
Perhaps.
I could fall in love with such a man, Dido.
Love?
Bette, you shall feel no such sentiment for you shall either end poor or broken-hearted.
Aren't you quietly relieved that you shan't be at the caprice of some silly Sir and his fortune?
The rest of us haven't the choice.
Not a chance of inheritance if we have brothers and forbidden from any activity that allows us to support ourselves.
We are but their property.
Girls!
Come along now.
Light the fires for dinner, will you, Thomas?
Certainly, ma'am.
Thank you.
Some bed-socks for you, Miss Murray.
Miss Lindsay.
Can I help you with that, Miss Lindsay?
You must start from the ends, miss.
My mam taught me.
See?
Nothing could have prevented him knowing that Miss Murray was visiting today.
Papa.
Lord Mansfield's infamous mulatto.
No wonder our Lord Chief Justice knows not whether he's coming or going.
Well she cannot know your thoughts unless you offer them to her.
Careful.
Oh, Dido, look, Mr. James has made me a boat and it has capsized.
What a dreadful shame.
For you.
Miss Lindsay, would you do me the honor of taking some air with me...sometime?
Don't you care what people will say?
What is that to mean, Mr. James?
What should anyone say?
That he would compromise a lady's reputation by stepping out with her scarcely having made her acquaintance.
I think you are a great deal too anxious, brother.
We should merely take a turn around Vauxhall.
I should be delighted, Mr. Oliver.
Most delighted.
Are you really to defy papa?
I did not think I would ever find a lady who was not to be conquered or ignored... ."unﬂlyou.
lam not at ease with this.
We are just two families spending some time together.
Although, if a desirable match were a possibility... ."yourdearhusband could have no objection, could he?
Oh, they've disappeared.
People will think she has no family.
People will think they are courting.
See how my heart beats?
I am utterly taken with you, Miss Lindsay.
Despite such pronounced protestations from your brother?
He cannot overlook your mother's origins as I do.
Foohsh.
Why should anyone even pay her regard when your better half has equipped you so well with with loveliness and privilege?
What a lovely sound.
You are unrelentingly cultured.
Come, let's find it.
I do hope you know how well I think of you.
As I do you.
I might have only dreamed of these moments, at one time.
Really?
Then I hope you plan to honor your attentions as not to would leave me looking quite foolish.
And I should not call myself a gentleman.
You are much of the conqueror, Mr. Oliver.
How how nice to see you.
A clergyman.
Good evening to you, sir.
Miss Lindsay.
You are alone.
I did not have the chance to see you before you left to convey my apologies.
Apologies?
Your pupillage.
Father would never have ended it, you never would have had to leave Kenwood...
He would make mine a living hell were he to know of us speaking.
I have tried to keep up with the Zong...
Forgive me.
I have tried to keep up...with the Zong.
What price a worthless negro?
You utterly misunderstand me.
I am saying that no man may have the value of cargo.
I am with others here.
All students in law applying pressure on the insurance companies to refuse from hereon to insure slaves on any ship.
But that would require a change in law.
How can we expect to be civilized when we live in such a barbaric world?
It is the shame of a law that would uphold a financial transaction upon that atrocity.
That is indeed the truth.
I have never heard anyone speak like you.
Nor I you, Miss Lindsay.
You should return.
They will be anxious.
Goodbye, Miss Lindsay.
Miss Lindsay we commune at the coaching inn, Kentish Town most evenings.
Quite.
Elizabeth is a determined spirit.
She will need a gentleman who can temper her.
Quite a task.
Do I sense that an address is finally to be made?
She is an exquisite girl.
And since there is no male heir it will fall upon Elizabeth and her husband eventually, to inherit Kenwood and all its lands.
I realize that there will be many worthy addresses to consider.
Lady Mansfield, what is it?
Pennﬂess?
Without an inch of property or a shilling to her name.
Do you hear that, James?
A lady's good breeding alone will not do.
Your brother needs a wife who can bring him more land if he is ever to exert more political influence than your father has!
But what of her own father?
The 7th Viscount Stormont is a scoundrel.
Ensconced in Vienna with that girl's vicious step-mama and his new offspring who, lam told, is to inherit everything.
I must say, pen-ni-less!
She has the coloring of a farmer.
James, you are my first boy - blessed by law to inherit your father's wealth.
Be sympathetic to your brother.
Like the unfortunate Miss Murray good family name and empty pockets will only get him so far.
ls Mabel a slave?
I beg your pardon?
Is Mabel a slave?
She is free and under our protection.
Oh, like me.
Hardly, Dido.
And paid a very respectable wage.
How is the fraud appeal, Papa?
Fraud?
It depends on who you speak to.
Do you speak on my behalf?
Will you please stop!
This is a vulgar subject to discuss at breakfast.
I'm not surprised Dido is beginning to sound very much like him.
Excuse me.
I had the pleasure of laying eyes on your adopted girl.
You have raised a lovely young lady and though I understand she is kept under interesting rules, she raises questions.
Parliament is nervous that the situation in your family will color your judgment.
I will not have pressure put on me, either from the inside or the outside.
You are the highest judgeintheland.
In you they see a man who is of the persuasion and the power to bring down the greatest trade of our time and the commercial health of this country.
Some will say that, next to our King, you're the most powerful man in England.
And the same will ask how you, our Chief Justice, can be fair?
There are rules in place which dictate how we live.
If that were not the case I would not have had the mandate to give shelter to my nephew's daughter.
She is his blood and mine and is rightfully entitled to be brought up on the family estate.
If the law supports the Zong slave owners as strongly as Murray blood runs through the veins of Dido Belle then make no mistake, the insurers will be forced to pay.
I believe you.
I, uh, have reason to speak with you on another matter.
Yes?
I have a wish to seal the bond between the Ashford and Mansfield names.
He never married.
He died last year after a long illness.
Oh, Aunt Mary.
Pardon me.
Mr. Ashford is here for you, miss.
Which Mr. Ashford?
Miss Lindsay.
Mr. Oliver.
I think well, I know that we make a rather good match.
Father has purchased me a commission in the Navy as Captain.
All that remains...
Uh, I cannot offer you a title for the next Lady Ashford well that title must fall to my brother's wife.
What I'm trying to say is, uh is I can, without doubt offer you all that is due to Mrs. Oliver Ashford and trust that this will be acceptable to you since it would very much be my privilege my honor, if you would agree to become my wife.
Good Lord.
Mrs. Ashford.
...cannot think of anything more wonderful.
Mama, we are engaged.
Oh, my darling.
it is a good thing, is it not, Mama?
Oh, it is a wonderful thing.
Dido.
Yes?
Was there any message for me?
No, Bette.
But I'm sure it won't be long.
What does it feel like, Dido?
To be engaged?
Perfect, Bette.
Perfect.
Papa?
Thank you.
We are to make many calls today, Elizabeth.
Acquainting oneself with the most eligible gentlemen is not light business.
Should we not wait a day or two ...for Mr. James?
Will you join us, Dido?
Oh. lam terribly light-headed this morning, Mama.
I should like to take rest, if it would not displease you.
Papa.
I need you to take me somewhere.
This is written anonymously.
I have a list of those who have not yet indicated their position.
Mr. Davinier?
Mr. Davinier.
Miss Lindsay.
What are they?
Papa's notes on the ship's log.
I could not find the log itself but look at papa's markings.
See the map positions.
Captain Collingwood and his men directed the ship past no less than 8 ports where there was every opportunity to replenish the ship's water supplies.
Good Lord.
And they did not.
They either ignored the possibilities or they were never in need.
This is remarkable.
Perhaps if you could make these facts known, Mr. Davinier.
This places you in an impossible position with Lord Mansfield.
What is the alternative?
Walk with me, Miss Lindsay.
The back of the inn is safe from anyone who may know you.
There's no-one but blind and crying drunks.
Papa would rather I see no ill, as though by ignoring it, it somehow escapes me.
Perhaps by position but not not by blood.
The fault was never with you.
Justasinlfie, we are no better in paintings.
You were afraid.
Afraid?
To be painted beside Miss Murray, and I ridiculed you.
I feel ashamed.
Do not feel ashamed.
Elizabeth said something when we arrived in London.
"We women are but the property of gentlemen."
But it came into my head that I have been blessed with freedom twice over.
As a negro and as a woman.
I suppose you have.
Or have I?
Must not a lady marry evenifsheis financially secure?
For who is she without a husband of consequence?
It seems silly - like a free negro who begs for a master.
I remember my father's eyes.
They were kind, gentle.
A little like yours.
I mean...in color.
He showed me much love though I only knew him a few hours.
What of your own mother?
I know very little of her other than the color she has given me.
Well then, at least you know she was beautiful.
I am to marry...shortly.
Mr. Ashford.
He is amiable and of good family.
The alternative is to replace Lady Mary in her responsibilities at Kenwood.
But she's a spinster.
Papa did not trust I could achieve a match that would raise my rank or even equal it.
You are above reducing yourself for the sake of rank.
I pray he would marry you without a penny to your name for that is a man who would truly treasure you.
And wealthy?
What if he is suitable but you do not feel 'yourself' with him?
And whenever he looked at me I somehow felt better in this world.
I am convinced his affections are growing and I feel certain of my own love.
You stop it.
You know no more of love than I myself, do you?
Do you, Dido?
No.
Oliver and Miss Lindsay make a blissful match.
Exactly when is she due to receive her inheritance?
And tell me, are you an only son?
I have 6 brothers, madam.
Older, madam?
Oh, how dreadfully wonderful, Lady M.
Indeed, Baroness Vernon.
And I see the other does not give up.
So terribly endearing.
You must meet the Mansfield girl.
Still available.
Mama, Mr. Vaughn approaches.
I have checked, he has no London home but he achieves an income of no less than £4,000 a year.
I trust your stay in London is proving pleasant, Miss Murray.
Oh, most certainly.
I wonder if you might permit me to call upon you at home...some time?
With her Ladyship's permission?
I will make arrangements.
Miss Lindsay.
Not husband hunting, are we?
Good Lord, I forgot you have ensnared my brother.
Tell me, are you to share his dining room as well as his bed?
Oh, Mr. James, your manners are as poor as your brother's finances.
And you are foolish enough to marry him.
That is painful, sir!
Have you never been manhandled?
It is not in my repertoire to keep company with beasts.
How dare you!
With ease.
You will destroy us.
You will destroy the entire order of our family.
I'd never imagined myself to be married, but my aunt is determined.
If one were to count, I have not even been acquainted with Miss Beresford on 3 occasions.
Is she not terribly disappointed that you will not return to Hampstead?
My aunt?
Well, I doubt Miss Beresford has any more wish to marry me than I her.
I should rather make a nuisance of myself alone in London than in an unwanted marriage in Hampstead.
Where is everyone, Mabel?
All the carriages are gone.
The ladies and Miss Murray are out calling, Your Lordship.
Is Dido with them?
I believe so.
Were you a curious child?
Dear, dear Bette.
Papa is to finally speak in a few days and...
I fear, despite persuasive argument, your papa has not been moved.
I'm not certain he is ready to go against the traders.
They are some of the most powerful in these isles and theirs are the finances that hold up England, after all.
The enemies of any man who stood against the trade would be vicious.
And yet, if he does...stand up if he speaks the words and condemns the trade the Lord Chief Justice of England, then it may be impossible for the slave laws of England and its colonies to remain absolute.
That is a fact.
I've heard nothing from him since Vauxhall, Dido.
I was certain an announcement was to be made any day...that he meant it this time.
Then he is not a man of his word.
I will help you find the kindest, most wonderful of husbands.
And I shall ask papa to use a portion of my inheritance for your dowry.
You would do that?
Bette...anything for you.
Dido I have been of the mind these last few days that it is my little means that has delayed James in making his approach.
I think you may be right.
I will ask papa to write immediately to Lady Ashford.
No?
Appropriate?
The brother of the man you are to marry is not appropriate for me?
He does not desire you, Bette!
Or at least, even if he does, you would regret such a mistake.
He laid his hands on me, Bette...in the most ungentlemanly fashion.
Why should you say such a thing?
He hurt me.
You are a liar!
Why would I lie to you?
I don't know.
Have you never been able to see?
You are beneath him!
I am beneath him?
Yes.
Tell me what I am, Bette!
You are you are illegitimate!
Have you never wondered why you were not permitted to eat with our guests?
My mother and father never married, you are correct.
But my father acknowledged me as his child.
It is yours who refuses to legitimize your position and that is why you are poor.
Papa.
This man's ambition includes you.
You will endure shame and risk your position for a man without name who will sully yours and drag your reputation into the gutter.
I take great offense at your summation of my character without even knowing me.
Not until you cease from judging the entire world as those above and those below and begin to see people as people.
Human beings who think and feel no more or less than you do.
I know there is a lady in Belsize who is waiting to be your wife.
No, I have an ambitious aunt in Belsize who, like you, assumes that wealth and reputation are all that life depends on and despises love as though it were the devil's own creation!
I love her with every breath I breathe!
Go, John.
You do not deserve this.
Captain Sir John Lindsay would never have behaved like this.
He would never have behaved like this because he was never here!
You are destroying your possibilities with the only gentleman who will consider you.
Is that what you want?
Arrogant parasite!
And his childish campaign simply adds to the ridicule aimed at me in those contemptible pamphlets.
And now, like some kind of saint, immune from reproach...
Quite some time before you entered your chambers, of course.
You simply became powerful enough to make new ones.
I always felt that you already loved me when I gave you my hand.
That we were a good match was never a doubt... ."butldon% think I could have married a gentleman without that light in his eye.
Without knowing, privately, that my heart stopped a moment each time that he looked at me.
It is possible that even you... ."cannotfightchange, my darling.
Sometimes you cannot fight it because you are a part of it.
Do you love her?
As though she were created of you and me.
And that is why I simply will not see her diminished.
The niece of the Marquis of Winchester.
Mr. James Ashford is to marry the niece of the Marquis of Winchester.
I'm reading it here.
Well, that will render your future mother-in-law ecstatic, Dido.
Don't you dare say a word.
I won't.
Why why do they always do that?
Who, Bette?
Men.
They just leave and never come back.
I saw you with Mr. Davinier at the pleasure garden.
You said nothing.
I wanted you to tell me.
To trust me.
I should have.
You know if I had your choice I would choose the man I loved.
I simply hope he's worth it.
I am not in the habit of requiring an explanation more than twice but on this occasion you will have to forgive me.
There is little point in repetition.
...whose unfortunate circumstances, at birth, we chose to forgive has decided she no longer wishes the match with my son a gentleman and an officer?
Why Miss Lindsay?
Do you feel I have any lesser need to ensure my child's wellbeing and future than you?
Does she still have a tongue?
I have a tongue...madam.
Though yours explains well enough why I may not marry your son.
You view my circumstances as unfortunate though I cannot claim even a portion of the misfortune to those whom I most closely resemble.
My greatest misfortune would be to marry into a family who would carry me as their shame as I have been required to carry my own mother.
Her apparent crime to be born negro and mine to be the evidence.
Since I wish to deny her no more than I wish to deny myself you will pardon me for wanting a husband who feels 'forgiveness' of my bloodline is both unnecessary and without grace.
It will hang at Kenwood.
Will it?
Why should that surprise you?
Why should it not?
What are you reading?
A gentleman named Thomas Day.
He speaks of a slave who agreed to marry an English lady.
A voice for people people like my mother who do not have one.
Do you find yourself in such writing?
I don't know that I find myself anywhere.
What do you want, Dido?
What precisely are you looking for?
I have enabled every rule of convention so that you would know exactly where you belong and yet little appears enough for you.
And what if there were not a rule, Papa?
What if the rule that allowed you to take me did not exist?
Would you have returned me to the slums?
You are courageous.
When it comes to the matters you believe in, society is inconsequential.
You break every rule when it matters enough, Papa. lam the evidence.
This painting is the evidence.
How on earth did the damn Quakers find their way in here?
You are a brave man, negotiating these quarters on the eve of yourjudgment.
...religion not being the only guardian of our morality.
And failing that, does the law not have a duty?
Does the Bench and Parliament not have a duty to uphold and create the laws that progress our morality not retard it?
If not to protect us from others then to protect us from ourselves.
Why does it matter to you so much?
If they had wanted water, they could have had it.
Dido took them.
That's correct.
Drive.
Then know that when you are gone, your legacy will be to have left Miss Lindsay in a world where she may be worth more dead than alive.
Miss Lindsay is not a slave.
By the very grace of God.
It's about all of us.
Mr. Davinier the world is a devastating place.
You must learn to protect your emotions if you wish to prevent matters both of law... ."andlove, from devastating you.
I am here today to rule on certain matters referred to me from the Lower Court in the case of the slave ship Zong.
How kind of you to come, Mr. Vaughn.
I have thought of nothing else but showing you Aunt Mary's chrysanthemums.
What a pleasure, Miss Murray.
You too, Mama.
Aunt Mary?
Whether the enslaved cargo was jettisoned in emergency to save captain and crew from certain death when the extended journey threatened shortage of drinking water.
Now let me be clear.-- the loss of water on a ship constitutes a singularly dangerous affair.
Insurrection of thirsty and hostile slaves at its extreme, and an impossible task to share diminished water reserve amongst all those living, at best.
Each implies a severe threat to the lives of the seamen.
And in such emergency circumstances our law is transparent and unequivocal.
Silence in court!
Gentlemen, silence in court!
However these were not the circumstances of the Zong.
Slaves were not jettisoned because water supplies ran low.
Indeed, evidence shows the ship sailed past 8 ports without pausing to restore water supplies.
My finding is that the slaves were jettisoned, killed, because the Zong ship's owners chose a tight packing fashion to transport their slaves.
They knew the risk since this fashion of transportation is well-known to cause disease in slaves.
Disease that rendered the Zong slaves impossible to sell.
It is not legal to discharge lives from a ship into the waters to facilitate insurance compensation.
Whether they be the lives of horses or human beings, slaves or otherwise it is not legal neither is it right.
it is clear that a fraud has been committed in claiming insurance on slaves who were drowned solely for financial gain.
It is my opinion that the state of slavery is so odious a position that nothing may support it.
Let justice be done though the heavens may fall.
You may not blame Mr. Davinier.
My attendance today is absolutely at my own volition.
I'm fully aware, Dido.
My Lord, lam inspired by your decision today.
We will not go backwards from here.
History will judge whether your optimism is warranted.
You're a man of conviction.
I'm trying to be.
And Mr. Davinier is not a gentleman?
He is, indeed.
My affections are with him, Papa.
And that is why he should have an occupation befitting one.
I wish for nothing if not to be his wife.
Your Lordship?
And, if you think it's a good idea I would like to facilitate your entry into the Inns of Court.
I think it is a very good idea, my Lord.
Can it be true?
No.
Because I cannot conceive of a life without you.
I love you for all that you are and with all all that I am.
Out of the yard!
Get everybody inside now!
It's a very unique prison break.
He thinks that, or he's hoping?
Just send me a sample to analyze.
I'll run through the database with whatever you've... got so far.
Damn it!
Artie, are those shelves still unstable from the quakes last week?
Yeah, annoyingly so.
It enhances visuals of any artwork that it shines on.
It's a... it's a huge birthday.
Trust me, I know Claudia, and I've planned the perfect party.
Well, that's what I'm worried about.
I happen to have a great surprise lined up.
Please tell me it's not a clown.
You know what?
So there's a US Marshal here now.
You forgot "henhouse."
Ah, nice catch, Marshal.
I watch it at least once a year.
Myka Bering, Secret Service.
Marshal.
Well, what's the ATF doing here?
We're working with the Secret Service to track an incendiary device.
What the hell kind of incendiary device makes molten lava?
Well, that's what we're here to figure out.
They're still counting.
Maybe this wasn't the actual prison break.
It was a diversion.
I'll order a full sweep and get a head count of all the inmates, get 'em going on that "henhouse" thing.
I love that guy.
This is great.
That was over, like, an hour ago.
- What?
One of the few older technologies that your generation still actually respects.
Plus, I have a very, very special, special surprise guest.
Tell me it's not a clown.
Let's just get one thing straight.
Clowns happen to serve a very important psychological and socioreligious function in society since 2400 BC.
No, you can't just go to a bar.
Artie, when you met me, I was a kid.
I'm an adult now.
You know, how many times have I actually saved the world at this point?
That definitely looks like an escape route...
I'm guessing made by an artifact.
While everybody else was busy in the yard, two convicts disappeared.
I want wheels on the road and eyes on the dirt.
If it's orange and moves, I want to know.
So this is the magic bottle, huh?
Davis is a member of the Third Street Turks... a crew deep into armed robbery and narcotics.
Their last project together landed them here in our lovely hillbilly spa and resort.
What about Joe Barton?
Bad man... armed robbery, assault, attempted murder.
I'm having Mr. Griff brought up.
Dude, what is wrong with you?
It's just that he's... you know, and, you know, we don't really...
I don't think that that's relevant.
Dude, why didn't you say so?
I mean, look at you... looks, brains, good taste, a deep knowledge of guns and blowing things up.
Maybe we can talk about it when I'm dead.
Okay, we're gonna go toss Barton and Davis's cells, far away from Mr. Hunky Ex.
He's me.
I knew I was your type.
Can this get any worse?
ATF and Secret Service seem like an odd mix.
You work with Steve long?
My bad.
It's a big mistake.
Oh, yeah, we call him "Social Steve."
Steve Jinks, right?
Well, I guess you never really knew Steve.
Guess not.
Oh, come on, you know the guy's name.
Steve just told me about him.
I heard you got two cons on the run.
So Barton leaves your crew, and Davis still breaks him out.
Seems like everybody kissed and made up.
Money.
So Barton's trying to... to buy his way back in with his own stolen loot.
He's gonna show Davis where it is.
Davis was supposed to take you, wasn't he?
But you got dropped at the last minute for Barton's big bag of money.
I didn't tell you anything.
They'd probably be very interested to know how helpful Griff was.
Yeah?
Well, then I'll tell 'em the truth.
You've been here talking to us.
Who do you think they'll believe?
Look, just tell us where Barton and Davis are going.
We'll forget this little conversation ever happened.
You really want to talk about this?
I know.
Doesn't sound like me, does it?
Well, I've been getting in touch with my sensitive side.
Knock knock, Steve.
I'm home.
Looking for a tunnel.
"Hey, babe, I can't wait to see you so we can be together forever."
See, Steve, poetry sucks 'cause it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, we need to figure out the cipher.
"Sees surrounded around the east"?
Look at these.
Prisons don't censor with x-acto knives.
"East, wall, cellar, noon, Monday."
Now that's a poem I can understand.
1979!
So where are we going?
Just donated to a gallery called Art of The Bay.
Yeah, we got to find it fast.
Well, it looks like Griff was right.
Liam, a truck.
She's trapped.
Might be the accomplice.
This must be Davis.
Door is welded shut with lava.
Turns out Davis had a pen pal.
She might have the artifact.
Well, he probably took off with the artifact.
But, Pete, the weird thing is, is that he left the cash here.
So, if he's not after the money, then what is it?
This old copper jug.
It belonged to my nana Paccia.
He grabbed my phone and locked me in the truck.
It's got to be the copper jug, right?
I mean, from Italy, shoots lava.
They've definitely had their share of volcanoes.
Okay, the most recent call was to a Paulie's diner.
Barton made it.
It's a 24-hour diner on the edge of town.
The Turks hang out their.
Barton obviously has an agenda.
Yeah, taking out Turks.
Maybe, uh, Pompeii.
You just point it, and it burns through.
You point it at a person, it does this.
So you recognize him?
So he heads right in there into the kitchen to talk to Paulie.
I heard some yelling, and then he was heading out again.
And that's when tattoo over there saw him.
Don't forget to recycle.
It looks like this guy Chris is Barton's next target.
Look, I'm trying to catch a fugitive, and I can't do that if I don't know what I'm dealing with.
Are we working together on this or not?
Liam, things would be a lot easier for both of us if you weren't here.
Speak for yourself, Steve.
Well, good luck with your top-secret national security spy versus spy.
I think I might go catch a fugitive.
Pete and I are gonna try and track down this Chris guy.
Yeah, but I don't...
Look, dude, there's baggage, okay?
I get it, but for now, we're stuck with your ex, and you know him better than any of us.
I've got Beethoven's 8th going on now, which is highly overrated.
It's making me a little irritable.
What's your usual excuse?
An alarm system...
Yeah, this is cutting it a little too close.
No, you're doing fine.
I'm the one who's almost getting us caught.
Things are missing.
Oil painting, fruit, $375... no.
Marble Aphrodite, $85?
Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5!
Unless what?
Pete, I think I figured out why...
Really?
Well, it was just sitting there.
She quit around a year ago the same time that Barton was arrested.
Here name was Christina Robertson.
It's been a while.
Look, I let you join me here.
Are we gonna talk about this or what?
Okay, so you're just gonna follow me around in case I find out what's actually going on, is that it?
We never actually did it.
You know, why don't we just check on the game?
You just left... gone.
You lied to me constantly.
You're a human lie detector!
And it was not constantly.
Yes, sometimes I lied.
You really want the truth all the time?
Okay, the only thing you can cook is lasagna, and even that sort of sucks.
That tea you drink smells like cat pee, and skinny jeans do not look good on you.
And I wanted to like you, but you made that so hard.
I was always scared I'd screw up, and... that made me screw up even more.
Look, I am sorry, okay?
I'll just have to make my peace with that.
So you're not part of the crew.
No, I don't want anything to do that life or those people.
You were expecting beachfront?
Looks like we're too late.
This is a pickup schedule.
The next pickup's in a mall parking garage about five miles from here in 30 minutes.
I don't have a son.
Look, Chris, I was a teenager once.
The dirty clothes, the heavy metal... it's all part of the package.
Is that it?
Did... did Barton come here looking for your son so... so he could hurt him?
Look, Chris, you need to talk to us, 'cause we can find Barton and stop him.
You don't understand, okay?
He would never hurt Kyle.
Mykes, that's why the money was left at the lake.
Yes.
Barton is Kyle's father, isn't he?
My aunt collects a lot of crap.
I'm trying to get her on that show... you know, the one people collect the crap?
They pay a lot?
I like money.
Well, you're not the only one with a crazy aunt.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna dump these, and I'll be right back.
She's got a bad heart, and, uh, she's really old.
Then you're part of the family, right?
Dead.
I'd rather not kill you, too, but I will.
I'm taking my kid.
Are you trying to be a dad all a sudden?
I came here to protect you.
These guys protect me.
Look at me.
I won't let you make the same mistakes that I did.
United States Marshal!
Guns down!
That bullet was meant for you, Kyle.
We have to bag that bottle.
I can hear you moaning.
Who knew a Prius was so badass?
Well, I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.
You still expect me to believe this is just an incendiary device?
It's about right for a Monday.
Mykes...
Oh, honey, you should go talk to him.
He's your dad.
He loves you.
Look, I-I don't know, Kyle, but he did... he did take a bullet for you, right?
I talked to Artie.
I really like Liam, Mykes.
You know, I sure hope those two crazy kids can work it out.
You know, you knew there was no way off that car.
You just didn't want me to risk anything.
As it turns out, I'm starting to think sometimes it's a really good thing you can tell when people are lying.
Thank you.
You're relentless.
I'm sorry, Liam.
Much better color.
Okay, I am willing to admit that one or two of the posters will actually look good in my room.
You run into you ex-boyfriend, and you don't text me?
There's no dirt.
Please, just no clown.
I can't believe I'm saying this out loud, but, ladies and gents, please welcome the Runaways' Cherie Currie!
How did you do this?
I hear there's a birthday girl in the crowd tonight.
Claudia, you want to come up join me up here?
I... saved her life back in '79.
What?
Artie killed Leena.
He's been whammied, just like we've all been whammied at some point.
You can't be serious.
She died by my hand.
And you will have to live with that.
How many errant static-electricity balls are there?
Here comes another one!
Okay, Vyasa wasn't some dude.
I'm waiting for the Bollywood version.
Now, how many mo sparkles we got left?
This is not my fault!
We can talk about blame later.
You're so gonna blame me.
Myka, you're in black and white.
- You're in black and white.
Oh, come on, not time travel again!
No, no, it's not time travel.
The 1940s were in color, much like the rest of history.
All right, then where are we?
I don't know.
Okay, it's Chicago in olden times.
Right, and then it was raining manuscript pages.
Not all of them-- look.
I loved Anthony Bishop.
Okay, so did you read Kiss Me, Forever?
That would explain the blank pages.
Well, he went insane from writer's block and then... killed himself.
Also, I'm sick of that tune.
It's gonna be hard to trick Artie.
Please, I always got the lead at the psychodramas at the institution.
Action.
I'm telling you, it's a ping.
And I'm telling you, it's a burglary.
This one guy had a '52 Desoto on display in his living room like a trophy.
Now, a burglar would have had to take it apart piece by piece to get it out.
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?
It's probably worth checking out.
There's lots of '52 Desotos.
File.
Clearly I stand corrected.
Oh, mark the date.
We'd miss a chance to learn from the master.
The ping king.
Also, safety in numbers.
We want to see the cool hot rods.
You wear torn clothing.
We all have our quirks.
So how's my acting?
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Any luck?
I must've run for ten blocks.
What's our next move?
I know my next move.
I hear you're the best in town.
I like what you hear.
Please, I didn't know where else to turn.
My husband has disappeared, and I think it has something to do with this.
Look what else made the trip.
Mrs. Carson, how can we help you?
I would love a cup of joe.
Sorry?
I think Mrs. Carson would like you, my secretary, to get her a cup of coffee.
Oh, I will put a little extra something in yours, doll.
So your husband likes elephants?
Oliver was an archaeologist.
He found this jade relic in India.
Well, it must have gotten pulled in with us.
And you and I fell into--into the roles of private detective and his gal Friday.
Or you consult this case by yourself while I make coffee.
Our artifact is what this story is about.
The case of the missing jade elephant.
And now we have a case to solve.
Maybe the way to escape is to do what the writer couldn't do.
And finish the story.
Yeah, except we don't have any of our tools here, okay?
Yeah, but we got one thing going for us.
What's that?
Nobody finds artifacts like we do, doll face.
Lamborghini Countach.
Yeah, and... '67 Mustang Fastback.
You've got a good eye.
Well, it is a V-8--
Excellent, because we are always looking--
No, we're not selling either.
Oh, window shoppers.
You know, I always say if you're looking, you're--
Just take us to the owner, please.
Grand theft auto, fraud, aiding and abetting.
Of course.
And you could cooperate by showing me your warrant.
Fine.
Artie, don't!
What the hell is that thing?
He's not lying.
- What's his name?
What else can you tell us about this phantom thief?
Yeah, no help here.
Stealy McThieferson is just sitting on his money.
No way to track him until he makes a withdrawal.
We're gonna have to identify target cars in the area.
Or we could get him to come to us tonight.
No, no, no, no, we need you to make a request for a very specific car that's only in town for tonight.
Very good, Jinksy.
Oh, Scarlett.
The dame said the last place she saw her husband was his office.
She may have said more, but I was too busy staring at her gams.
The only thing stopping them going on forever was the floor.
Pete, are you narrating?
No, I'm just-- I'm getting into character.
Hey, noir films are awesome.
Yes, but Bishop's novels are superb.
They had an elegance, a beauty.
Myka Ophelia Bering, are you actually enjoying this?
Hello, handsome.
This book hurts.
I must apologize for the manner in which you were escorted here.
Untie us, and we'll call it Jake.
Of course.
After you tell me why you were at Mr. Carson's office.
We were looking for dope on who snatched him.
I guess we found it.
You're quite astute for a woman.
I went to college.
I bet you did.
There is such a thing as too smart.
You want to know a secret?
I am awash with anticipation.
There's been a terrible misunderstanding.
Yeah, you misunderstood how kick-ass my partner can be.
This club is, uh, merely a hobby.
I am, by vocation, shall we say, a procurer of rare and valuable artifacts.
Oh, yeah?
I hired Mr. Carson to find the elephant.
But alas, once found he decided to retain ownership.
Greed.
I bet you know all about that.
I paid him.
That means I am the owner of the jade elephant and the wronged party in this sordid tale.
Yeah, tell that to my aching jaw.
Again, my sincere regrets.
Here, a retainer to find my elephant.
Come on, this'll be duck soup.
You are enjoying this!
Carson may be our only lead, but this place has already been tossed.
Barnabas' goons must have missed something, otherwise he wouldn't have hired us.
Anthony Bishop, the author-- his mother's name was Kristieanne.
Yeah, so?
Oh, right, so the goons would never know that.
Pete, it's the '40s.
You could have bribed him with $5.
And I want change from that "C" note, see?
He's not coming back, is he?
Someone's erased an entry.
That is a noir name if I ever heard one.
Pete, Augustus Rivers is a real archaeologist.
And our missing Mr. Carson is an archaeologist.
He must be using rivers as his alias.
That remind you of anything?
I'd say there's a jade elephant in the room.
Carson's still got the elephant.
I don't think so.
This is Oliver Carson, and he's dead.
Pete, this isn't just a story about a missing relic.
Why couldn't we have fallen into a cookbook?
They're hiding his tears.
This is great.
Hotel's name is clearly visible, so the thief will know exactly where to find it.
Yeah, Lambeth sent this link with the money, so all we have to do is wait for the thief to show up.
Tell me you are not messing with one of my Tesla grenades.
Yeah, well, I'm not taking any chances.
Oh, you made a GPS tracking device.
Okay, your-- your little trick with the Tesla grenade must have bumped it to a different frequency.
- This is my fault now?
This is very cool.
If Bishop couldn't solve his own murder mystery, how are we supposed to?
No idea, but if we don't, we'll be trapped in black and white forever.
Any chance you want to tell Mrs. Carson her husband is dead?
Oh, I'm just the secretary.
Can I help you?
Yeah, we're working for Mrs. Rebecca Carson.
Is she home?
Mrs. Carson hired us to find her husband.
May we speak with her?
Is this a joke?
I'm Rebecca Carson.
I'd say that's significant.
Can you tell us anything about her?
She has terrible taste in men.
A name would be more helpful.
All I know is he met the little round heels at the Indigo Club.
Oh, that joint again.
On the other hand, why would she hire us to solve a crime that she committed?
We'll grab her after the song.
Detective Lattimer, you cut a rug.
Good evening, Mrs. Carson.
Yes, I lied.
If I'd have told you the truth, you wouldn't have helped me.
I was here rehearsing.
It's time to start singing, sister, and I don't mean no love song.
That's a baloney sandwich, and you know it.
Let me guess.
You're a small-town gal caught up in the wrong crowd.
Now you're in over your head, and all you want is a way out.
Disappear and leave this life behind.
That the picture?
How did you know that?
I've heard that tune a hundred times-- same song, different key.
Now sing me the chorus.
I'll even start.
Barnabas has you under his thumb.
He made me get close to Mr. Carson, to keep an eye on him while he searched for the jade elephant.
Get close, huh?
Is that '40s talk for "have sex with"?
How dare you?
I am a lady.
That's why I hired you, to keep him safe.
You fell for Carson.
I felt bad for Carson, but I didn't love him.
I have a man, and we're gonna run away from all of this.
I have to recalibrate the whole thing.
What was Artie thinking?
What--what's correct?
- What's she saying?
Okay, this-- this could be our guy.
Tell her to get out of there.
Calm down, I'll fix it en route.
Look, Artie, she has a plan.
You've been overreacting all day.
We'll use Claudia's computer to hack into the traffic cams and follow the car.
I was trying to save Claudia.
How are you gonna save Claudia by jumping in front of a moving car?
No one else is dying on my watch!
I rented the same car that Claudia owns.
Barnabas kills Carson, grabs the elephant.
Pete, don't be fooled by a pretty face and a bad dye job.
Mykes, did you notice how I didn't make a joke there?
It's got to be a trap.
No, whoever wrote this-- we need to talk to them right now.
We--we used the front door like everyone else.
So you're a real person too.
Pete, this is Anthony Bishop, the author.
Now drop this case, or I shut both your private eyes for good.
How'd you know I was me anyway?
Oh, man, you wouldn't believe it.
How did you get in here?
Please, Mr. Bishop, it's important.
Well, if you're a fan, then you know how I dedicate every book.
Something happened to her.
It happened so fast.
One day she was sick, then she was gone.
I'd sit in front of my typewriter and close my eyes, and I'd imagine this world.
Yes, but our way out is still the same.
Mr. Bishop, in order for us to get out of this world, we need to--well, we think we need to finish your story.
No, I don't want this story to end.
Stop trying to solve it.
It was you.
You erased Carson's alias from the-- from the hotel register, didn't you?
Why?
Mr. Bishop, what's here for you?
You stay away from Lily.
Look, Mr. Bishop, we just want to get out of here, okay?
I mean, what's that have to do with Lily?
All of his books end with someone innocent dying in a shootout.
In this one, it's supposed to be Lily, isn't it?
That's why you couldn't finish your story.
I couldn't save her in the real world, but I will in here.
I won't lose her again, see?
You're in this book for good.
Mr. Bishop!
See, this is why I don't read.
We're not safe here anymore, darling.
We've got to skip town.
Where will we go?
Let's go there.
Bora Bora?
That's just a daffy dream.
Oh, it's a dream I can make come true, but we got to go tonight.
He got a phone call, and he dusted out, left me a lousy nickel.
But, uh, I could keep you company until he gets back.
And this is why you should watch movies.
No, no, I really do.
No, what do they say about redheads?
Any chance you listened in on the last call?
Maybe--I don't know-- something about an elephant?
Oh, brains too.
You're the whole package, Doris.
Thanks, doll.
You would've done great in the '40s.
Charm is timeless.
Or women got smarter.
Hello, sparky.
Hello, artifact.
Window shopper!
Are you sure this is the place?
According to my new pal Doris, he was buying an elephant on the 4th Street Bridge.
Pete, it looks like we're too late.
Electric burns, just like Carson.
Pete, look at that.
The scratches-- they look like they were made by fingernails.
Yeah, long ones.
It looks like he's been attacked by a woman.
Mykes, look at this.
Barnabas fought back.
Myka, we know a woman with long black hair.
A woman who knew Carson well enough to know where he'd hide out.
Yeah, who was really pissed about her husband abandoning her.
Rebecca Carson, the jilted wife.
Man, can't anyone in a Bishop novel be trusted?
I loved Oliver, until he found this stupid elephant and dumped me for some dopey dame with a voice.
Yes, Barnabas was loaded with dough.
He promised to pay for the elephant, then decided he could just take it.
Now you're gonna kill me just for looking at it?
That would have been a lousy ending.
Did you get the elephant lady?
Rebecca thought Barnabas had loads of it.
- Pete, the Indigo Club.
- Let's beat it.
Tony, that's not enough scratch to get us to San Diego, much less Bora Bora.
Relax, lil, I know the combination to the safe, and Barnabas has got plenty.
You better know the combination.
Getting me that cabbage is all that's keeping your little chippy alive.
I'll fry you both before you can pull the trigger.
Nice scam, sales lady-- stealing cars and trying to sell them back to your boss.
Cars deserve to be driven, okay?
People who lock them up like trophies don't deserve them.
Are you all right?
I am gonna be sore tomorrow.
This place is locked up tight.
We'll never get out of here in time to catch up to her.
Oh, Steve of little faith.
Snagged one during the fight because I'm awesome.
Okay, well, if she could-- you know what?
Old man totally tricked us.
Well, to be fair, he wasn't lying.
You and your loogan just made a trip for biscuits.
Now I'm putting you in a wooden kimono.
That's not even English.
Doesn't matter, because this is over.
You let Rebecca walk out of here so she lets Lily go, or you both die.
The dame already fried two people, Bishop.
The first chance she gets, she'll drop you both into deep freeze.
They're on our side.
Shut your trap, you dumb broad!
Scram, or I throw lead.
No, my life is here now, with Lily.
- I love you, baby.
- You're all I care about.
Save it for the boat ride.
Bishop, there's no way that Rebecca is a real person trapped in here too, is there?
No, I based her on my mother-in-law.
Well, you'll like this, then.
Now, that's hard-boiled.
Loftin must have endowed the gloves with the ability to make any car untouchable.
What was that noise?
- Artie, what are you doing?
Yeah, what if she doesn't?
Artie, what if she doesn't stop?
His first field mission in a while was bound to have some hiccups.
Okay, so why are we still here?
'Cause we didn't bring the killer to justice?
In a noir, a bullet is justice.
I'm working a hunch here, but just cross everything you got, sweetheart.
Nice.
How did you know that the fog would be our ride home?
It's the end of Casablanca.
They stole that from Bishop, you know?
And here he comes.
I guess they stole the tearful good-bye too.
I don't understand.
I can't stay.
I'm not from this world.
It's hard to explain.
Believe me, I don't want to go.
Then stay with me.
Be good, kid.
What would happen if he stayed?
The story's over.
I don't know if you get your happily ever after or you just fade away.
One more second with her is a happier ending than a lifetime without her.
Okay, now, that is a good line.
All right, all right, I'll read the books.
What was that?
That was the stuff dreams are made of, sweetheart.
And also painful-- ah-- really, really painful.
All the pages have writing on them now.
We finished the story.
Thank you for your candor.
We've been worried about Agent Nielsen as well.
This confirms our fears.
What does that mean?
It's time for the Regents to act.
When you asked me to keep an eye on Artie, you said it was to help him.
Trust us, Agent Jinks.
And the last few months are not something that Artie will get through easily or quickly.
We need to be there for him, not bronze him or turn him into some HG Wells hologram.
Noted, Agent Jinks.
The less you know, the better it is for Agent Nielsen.
As I say, trust us.
"He's very dashing."
I am dashing, aren't I?
I don't have a dopey grin.
Pete, listen to this.
"Neither of them had ever seen water this blue.
"She smiled, brighter than the tropical sun.
It made him happier than he'd been in a long time."
Good for Bishop.
Well, maybe that's why he had writer's block.
He, uh... didn't realize he was writing a love story.
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.
Your friend picked me up instead.
Maybe she's just as nervous about seeing us as we are about seeing her.
Guys, she's the exact same Spencer that we saw last week.
Em, we're not just here for her, we're for you, too.
Do we talk about him?
Do we bring it up?
I mean, maybe there's hope.
Oh, you've got to love the Hastings.
I just get released from a mental hospital, and they welcome my friends with tea and crumpets.
What's the difference between a crumpet and an English muffin?
Hanna, does it matter?
Yeah, if this was the act you had to pull off to get out of there, then...
I wasn't as strong as you were.
When I saw Toby in the woods, like that, I just gave up.
So what changed?
You seem like you're back to yourself.
I decided I didn't want to be victim anymore.
That's not who I am.
Here.
Could really use some support.
Can you guys please come?
Of course.
You'll get your reward Friday.
Those bitches are finally going to get what they deserve.
Yeah, like did she have dark hair, horns, and a tail?
Guys, no, we are not using Malcolm to get to Mona.
What are you saying, Spence?
Okay, well, Malcolm is off limits, okay?
Gotta get to class.
I can use some extra money.
Did you not just hear Aria?
But I say if it's water, it's wet, right?
Uh, shana, this is Spencer.
I'll look for you.
I hate her.
Yeah, they called this morning.
I don't think it's going to work out for me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You said you were going to make it all go away.
I'm worried that the police have evidence.
Look, I need to see you today.
I've got to go.
I just got off the phone with your mom.
Did you know that Ezra was applying for a teaching job at Rosewood high?
Yeah, he applied for a job subbing in the district.
He was offered the position this morning, Aria.
Ezra asked for the day to decide if he wants to take it.
So, Aria didn't tell me that you were interested in the job.
It's a joke.
He's into trains.
Um, do you have a resume, or anything?
I've missed you.
They'll all be together this Friday.
You know what you need to do.
Um, I'll have good days and bad days.
Eventually they'll all be bad.
On your darkest days, you know I'll be here for you.
Is everything okay?
Why didn't you tell me that they offered you the job?
'Cause I don't think I'm going to take it.
And I didn't think you should share in the burden of that decision.
You need a job, Ezra.
Yeah, but you know what would happen to us if I end up back at Rosewood.
Nothing about us feels right anymore.
I'm sorry.
Things aren't easy, but they can still be good.
It shouldn't be this hard.
If you're not happy anymore...
You know, that's what matters most to me.
Hey, I love you just as much as I always have.
And that's why I want you to take this job.
Aria, wait, wait.
I love you.
It's seat yourself, pretty eyes.
Were you a part of it?
Mona told me after.
And you let me believe that you were dead?
Everything I've done, was so I could protect you.
I want to believe that.
Let me take you somewhere safe.
She told me you'd be there Friday.
That you'd be my reward for delivering the girls.
How'd you find me?
She left me alone in her lair.
I kidnapped a seven-year-old.
I'm the reason that Aria and Ezra broke up.
So, I've earned her trust.
It's not safe for you to be here.
I stopped worrying about me a long time ago.
What we had was real.
I've been pretending to work with Mona so I could keep you safe.
I need you to believe me.
And I need you to follow me.
My dad said I can watch cartoons.
It's your choice if you want to grow up to be stupid.
Just sayin'.
That's Aria.
She didn't take you to the carnival?
I went with Aria's friend, Alison.
What about this?
What about this person?
That's a boy.
I am going to go call my friend really quick.
I don't understand, they have the tapes and that can't... no, I do understand, but those bitches are going to be at the lodge at nine.
Do you understand?
Doesn't look like anybody lives here.
I shuffle between a few motels.
Mona doesn't know about this one.
And red coat?
The only thing I know about red coat is that she's in charge.
I know.
You still don't trust me.
Look, I understand why you've been helping Mona.
No wonder I was a fat kid.
Alison's right here.
I don't remember that.
It just popped up.
That can't be who you saw.
That's Aria's friend, Alison.
No, Malcolm, that girl's...
I remember her pretty hair.
Spencer?
That's Allison.
I mean he said she was the girl in the blue shirt.
We're going to figure it out.
And then it's going to be your turn Emily, so get ready to say goodbye to Paige, 'cause I promise you, "A's" going to take her from you.
Why would Spencer do this to us?
Guys, I don't believe for one second that Spencer's on the a-team.
Are you thinking shock treatment?
Mona asked Spencer to join the a-team on the night of the masquerade ball.
Did Spencer finally take her up on it?
Yeah, but why now?
There's a way to prove that Spencer's still with us, and if Mona's watching, it won't put Spencer at risk.
Look, a was everywhere before Spencer joined the a-team.
Do you really think we're meeting in secret?
I took the job.
You remember what you said at Ali's funeral?
You know, this doesn't have to be forever.
I need to move on, and so do you.
Bye, Ezra.
What is this?
You followed me here, that means you don't know who she is, either.
And if you don't know who she is, that means you're still one of us.
We want to help you.
Mona came to see me at Radley.
And when I found Toby in the woods, she'd planned the whole thing.
So, Mona made you an offer you couldn't refuse?
She told me that Toby was still alive.
Emily: Toby's alive?
But this party tomorrow, it's a set-up.
I'm the one who sent you the picture of me and Ali.
You've found a way to get to me without her knowing about it.
So, instead of red coat waiting for us tomorrow, we'll be waiting for her.
And if we're lucky, this will all be over with.
Luck won't have anything to do with it.
Uh, if we open up to chapter one, we'll find out why Hemingway said,
"all things truly wicked, start from innocence."
That place is really nice.
How can you afford new miu mius?
That's if you don't wear them.
Doesn't say that on the receipt.
( Phone beeps ) They're running late.
How late?
And we will be.
You have no idea what she's capable of, Spencer.
I saw them getting ready.
And I have the video you asked for.
It's safe for you to land.
It's finally about to end.
You're getting what you've always wanted.
She doesn't know the others aren't here yet.
I told you, they're coming.
Why don't we for a walk while we wait?
I know how you feel, Spencer.
It sucks to be lied to.
Get up.
I believed you.
I said get up!
You won't get away with this.
I'd say "watch me," but you won't be here to see it.
If something goes wrong, you know what you need to do.
Going somewhere?
You're making a terrible mistake.
That's not how we see it.
We know enough.
Get to the plane.
What have you done?
( Phone dialing ) Mona, try your phone.
Nothing.
Shut up, Mona!
Red coat.
You guys, we have to get out of here.
Ali?
Did anyone see her?
No, you're hallucinating.
Ali's dead.
I saw her, too.
She stole you from me.
So what happened that night?
Were you there at the cemetery?
She looked just like Ali.
Wait, is that?
Somebody pulled it out of the lake.
We've have to get this out of here.
Spencer: They know Wilden?
"A."
Yo, Burset.
We're clearing out, man.
What the fuck you doing?
Cap wanted me to document the damage.
You gotta check out this life-sized fucking panda bear they got in their living room, half burnt.
It's got one melted plastic eye.
Come on, I'll show you.
So I say to her, "You're the third pregnant girl I've rescued this month."
She goes, "But, I'm not pregnant!" And I go, "You're not rescued yet!"
You sick fuck, do that in the bathroom.
I got cancer.
He does whatever he wants.
Look at this.
I asked Sophia to do my roots, she says there's a two-week waiting list.
I wouldn't let that he-she touch my hair with a 1 0-foot pole.
Well, hey, maybe you'll get lucky and go bald everywhere but in the tits like Rosa.
And Sophia's pole is a hole now.
Watson, Bresnahan and Diaz, report to your counselor for your bunk assignments.
Watson, Bresnahan and Diaz.
Finally.
Wait, you got assigned?
This is bullshit.
Fuck you.
Why didn't I get assigned?
They're probably sending her to Spanish Harlem.
They're gonna put you in The Suburbs with the other white people.
You afraid you're gonna end up with your rocka-lezzie girlfriend?
For the toilet?
Go pee, kid.
I spent a lot of money for it.
Go ahead, it's all yours.
That's okay, I think I'll just wait.
You gonna be waiting a long time, now.
She's talking to the devil.
Yeah, I got that part.
That's Satan's stall.
At least Satan gets a door.
You better hope they got what you need.
Ain't had powder foundation in dark for three months.
I can't be walking around here with white face on.
But those sad pair of shower shoes are not gonna save you.
You need some of these.
I made my own.
Couture.
Commissary don't carry a size 1 3.
You gotta get it out while you can.
Why are you telling me all of this?
'Cause I fucked up your hair.
That shit looks broke.
Black girl with a white girl booty.
I mean, what's the point?
Watch out for this one, man.
Fucking meth heads, man.
Hey, Burset.
Smell that.
That smell good to you?
Mickey D's?
How long's it been since you had one of these?
Long time.
Do you want some?
You offering me a taste?
You can suck it out of my dick.
I don't do sausage in my breakfast sandwich.
What the fuck are you doing inside the CO bubble?
Cyborg pussy.
I bet it's fucking perfect.
Don't tell me you'd hit that?
I live in the present, not in the past.
Besides, she used to have a dick, and so she knows what it likes.
What'd you guys do about pussy in Iraq anyway?
Did you fuck camels?
And if you try to have sex with the girls there, their village throws rocks at 'em till they die, so there's not a lot going on.
Plus, they're all dressed like beekeepers.
Occasionally, a Russian hooker comes through, but those girls are nasty and they cry a lot.
It's the fucking pheromones, man.
You get 'em all locked up like this for a long time, and they get this prehistoric yearning for man-stink.
I'm musty and they love it.
You don't really...
Burset.
What's the dose?
.5 milligrams.
I do what the chart says.
Fatovich!
You got a name, girl?
That's your bed, those two are your hooks.
This ain't like the projects in here, I got rules.
No sleeping all day 'cause it's depressing.
Clean up after yourself.
If I find a mess on this floor, my floor, you're gonna hear about it.
And keep your food sealed, because I don't need chipmunks or roaches in here trying to get their Cup O' Noodles on, plus that poor excuse for food stinks to high heaven...
I sleep whenever I want, old lady.
And I don't know what busted-ass country you come from, but this is America, and if I want noodles, I'll eat noodles.
Now, back off across your floor before I make you that mess you hate so much.
Time to peel that orange, Chapman.
You're one of us now.
Ten.
Did your feet swell when you went back to boys?
Fuck you.
You can't just change people's meds!
I got a line of golden girls complaining about blood pressure pills.
Half this prison's on antidepressants.
You take away their Zoloft, they're gonna go off the rails.
Look at me, I'm paying for my own coffee here.
I got a tranny camped out in my hallway yelling about her hormones!
If he wanted to keep his girlish figure, he should've stayed out of jail.
Why would anyone ever give up being a man?
It's like winning the lottery and giving the ticket back.
Hello, baby.
Look at you getting your sweat on.
You look all shiny.
I bet you don't even smell funky.
I knew you wouldn't.
I can't waste my time with these silly bitches.
I need a real woman.
I'm sure that you'll find one.
I wrote it for you.
You know, my fiancé is a writer.
I'm gonna call you Dandelion.
'Cause they're pretty, and yellow, just like you.
What's going on?
Locking up the track.
-Why?
But I have to run.
This is the only thing that makes me feel normal.
Ya'll gonna have to do your swirl someplace else.
Swirl?
Chocolate and vanilla.
The bottom line is that the prison can no longer provide high-end hormones.
If I don't get my medication, I'm going through withdrawal.
This is an emergency.
Yeah, well, we don't see it that way.
Was there something else?
Yes.
I'd like to report an emergency.
What, is she gonna put a voodoo curse on me?
Island bitch got control issues.
Yeah, I believe it, too.
You look in her eyes and know she seen some shit.
I'm not scared of her.
You should be.
I hear when she was down the hill she threw a pot of boiling water in her bunkie's face.
Yo, come on, now.
She'll see what she be messing with.
Yo, the lady ain't taken a visitor in 1 0 years 'cause she won't do strip search.
That's some steel right there.
I had to rub Red's feet for this. 45 minutes.
You can't sit there.
No, we don't.
I plan on spending my entire sentence avoiding you.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You bothering my friend here?
Dandelion, she bothering you?
No, we were just talking.
Yeah, she is bothering me.
Are you kidding me?
Move, bitch.
This is my wife here, so you need to step...
Well, no, I'm not actually your...
Don't make me cut you!
Take it easy, take it easy.
I'm not your wife.
I threw my pie for you.
The head should pass through your body in three to five days.
Unless you start vomiting or have severe cramping, it's best just to let the body eliminate this on its own.
I'm gonna have to shit it out.
If it made it down your esophagus, it should travel the rest of the way.
If it doesn't pass in a week, we'll consider surgery.
Pay close attention to your stool.
I don't think I could miss it.
I'm going to have to put you on suicide watch.
You really think I would've eaten a bobble-head if I wanted to kill myself?
I can't go back.
Unfortunately, you have elevated levels of AST and ALT, which could mean liver damage...
We're gonna take you off your hormones entirely...
But that could take months.
I can offer you an antidepressant.
Oh, my God.
That's what happens when I shop for myself.
It's 'cause I never got to be a teenage girl.
And you never will be.
You should be dressing like a classy grown-up lady.
You think I'm classy?
I can't have my husband walking 'round like a $2 hooker.
Let's see.
Can't believe I'm doing this.
You don't have to.
That is much better.
I can't zip it, but you get the idea.
Please keep it.
Crystal...
Just please keep your penis.
You don't have to stay.
No?
Besides, your tits are better than mine.
You're perfect.
Come here.
I promised your brother I'd help him fix the roof of his trailer.
I need a buffer!
Why can't you just come and visit me every single waking moment that you're allowed to and make your life all about me?
Piper, we talked about this, okay?
Visits every other week, so I can have a life.
But I'm an idiot.
I'm not sure that Cal gets the "family fuck-up" title anymore.
You okay, Pipes?
You forgot to bring the bags.
Did you go to Whole Foods?
What did you get?
A bunch of stuff.
God, smoothies.
Then some purple kale, Uncle Eddie's vegan cookies.
I can feel them in my mouth.
Yeah, yeah, the crack almonds.
The crack almonds.
I thought that's what we...
I'm confused.
Sweetie, I'm sorry.
I love your little boobs.
You're not allowed to put stuff on the walls.
Everyone has stuff on their walls.
Officer!
Your kid draw that?
I did.
No, it's nice.
I mean, it's cool that you can draw, you know?
It's art.
So you gonna allow that shit?
She can leave it up.
-What did you do to your hair?
-I had to give it to a transsexual.
For a weave.
Interesting.
I mean, this could totally be a fake belly full of drugs.
How would they ever know?
Piper, please.
You didn't touch anything in that bathroom, did you?
Everything around here is so sticky.
But the people are much cleaner than I thought they'd be.
How are you feeling, Pol?
It is so smart to do this now.
But it's true.
You just don't have a lot of time to waste.
I'll go get some snacks.
The whole way up she hummed Édith Piaf songs and ate pistachios.
I have a wife!
Her name is Crazy Eyes and she follows me everywhere.
That really happens?
She follows me everywhere.
She threw pie for me.
Did she rape you?
No, she didn't rape me.
But she held my hand.
That's kind of sweet.
I just told you that I have a wife.
But you were supposed to be my wife, Piper, remember?
I'm kind of freaking out that you're not gonna be there.
I know.
I'm sorry.
We just got this crib pad that sets off an alarm if the baby stops breathing.
Which could totally happen.
I mean, that's a thing.
And there's a skinny bitch in my pre-natal yoga, she's a stick who swallowed a grapefruit.
The other day she asked me if I was having twins.
So what about the Barney's order?
Did you find a warehouse?
Well, that's why we hired Mariana.
I fired her.
Wait, but why didn't you ask me first?
That's not fair.
Honey, it's not as if we can pick up a phone and call you.
I know it's hard, but the rest of us have to keep living our lives.
How you doing, Red?
I'm missing half my zucchini.
These girls don't realize I'm here to provide food, not dildos.
I'm all out of cucumbers, carrots, beets.
God knows what they're doing with those.
Can't hang on to anything cock-shaped.
A little.
You, I don't understand you.
I already made my baby.
Listen, I need you to get something in.
Besides, even if I wanted to help you, I don't have connections like that.
And I'll get you some soy, but that's the best I can do.
What if I have my own connections?
Listen, sweetheart, there's other channels.
But I really don't think you wanna go down that road.
I like the Lebrons.
You want the highs or the lows?
Both.
If it were up to me, my man, I'd say the lows.
We'll take 'em, right?
Excuse me, do you have...
Hey, Michael, what are you doing here?
Shit!
Hi, Pat.
Shit...
Yeah.
Take care, Michael.
Nice kicks.
Yes, Chapman.
This type of hanky-panky is against prison regulations.
I warned you about this when you first came in.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Warren just informed me that you'd like to be bunked together.
Crazy Eyes?
Lesbian request denied.
Believe me, the last thing I want is to be anywhere near her.
I've been trying to shake her for days.
I would like to stay as far away from that as possible.
I was hoping that that was the case.
She is completely nuts.
Ran that up the ladder a couple of times, got no traction at all.
My advice?
Let her down easy.
Lesbians can be very dangerous.
It's the testosterone.
Hey, you, Laura Ingalls Wilder.
What can I get for you?
Hi, I was wondering if you're hiring?
No, I'm sorry.
Well, can I leave this with you?
Honestly, it's just gonna end up in a drawer somewhere, so...
That I can do for you.
It's a little cold out for a margarita, don't you think?
Let's see this.
Steve's Greek Cuisine?
Le Grand Fromage?
Bullshit, bullshit.
You need a lesson in fudging a resume.
Do you work here?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Manager, Polly Harper.
It's my friend.
You've never waited a fucking table in your life, have you?
No.
That sounds kind of dirty.
I like that in a woman.
What else do I need to know about you?
Who are you?
My name is Alex.
I work for an international drug cartel.
And my banjo.
Those are my friends, my beans and my banjo.
You gotta have hobbies.
What about you?
What's happening with the writing?
Hey, when you visit, do you get to...
It's where you jerk off, okay?
Right to the point of orgasm and then stop.
And you do this because...
And this is something you do?
Kind of like a female orgasm.
You know, most dudes, they don't know what women got, but trust me, bro, it is way, way better.
A lot of creative people do it.
In fact, they say that John Lennon wrote Imagine right at that sweet spot.
How about we don't talk about sex with your sister?
Good point.
No, no, not jail, but something, yeah.
She wants to feel like she's different.
Likes the whole "I'm risky" thing.
Not like my parents ever saw it.
But, like, I was free to smoke a bowl and fuck off for the rest of my life with nobody ever bothering me.
Piper going to jail might be, like, the worst thing that has ever happened to me.
Sophia!
I got you a present.
It's powder foundation in medium dark.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I got commissary.
Look whose ship finally came in!
And, Nicky, here's your cup.
Don't be a commissary ho, DeMarco.
Hello, baby.
Can I talk to you?
Listen, Suzanne.
I know that you like me...
I don't just like you, Piper.
Yeah, I got that.
And I'm just not interested in anybody else.
Not gonna happen.
I feel you.
Where is he?
They let him pitch Friday.
That's great.
They took me off my hormones.
What, why?
They're saying it's liver damage.
I'm losing my shit, Crystal.
I didn't wanna have to ask you, but I don't know what else to do.
I need you to sneak 'em in.
How?
I don't know.
Put 'em in my mouth so I can kiss you?
Have you lost your fucking mind?
It's crazy, I know.
Yeah, Michael can go live with my mother, who won't speak to me anymore at all.
I'm working two jobs, I'm trying to raise our son.
You know they trying to seize the house?
They can't do that.
I never paid any of our bills with those stolen credit cards.
I can't even show my face in church anymore.
I'm sorry.
How fucking selfish can you be?
Crystal, if they take this away from me, this will all have been for nothing.
I married a man named Marcus.
I cry for him all the time.
But I stayed and I supported you because I could see how much pain you were in.
I know it was saving your life.
It was.
I figured better my kid had two moms than a dead dad, right?
At least he'd be around, which is more than my father was.
At least he'd be at his baseball games, even if it was in a dress.
So I put up with you becoming a woman, but I never signed on for a life with a criminal.
Get the fuck out of here, so you can be a father to your son.
Man up.
What the fuck is this?
You fucking kidding me?
You had me moved?
Who's running this place?
Not you.
Shut your mouth and get your things.
Watch yourself, little girl.
This is not America, this is The Litch, and I've been here a long while.
-You didn't have to take me down with you.
Is that what all this is about?
You think I turned you in?
You haven't seen me in five years, you had no idea what was going on with me.
You never ever forgave me for leaving.
Thirteen people were indicted.
I know it was you.
No, it wasn't!
And fuck you for thinking it was!
Right, what did they give you?
Time off for every innocent person that you threw under the bus?
Innocent?
That is fucking hilarious!
Your fiancé might buy this bullshit, but I know you.
I know you.
And there were no complaints when I took you all over the world, but the second shit got real...
You were just this boring little girl from Connecticut, who wanted to feel special and bad.
And, yeah, maybe I never forgave you for leaving, because you broke my fucking heart.
And maybe I've done a lot of fucked up things in my life, but I've never lied to you.
Ever.
I'm stuck.
I think my necklace is caught on my shirt or in my hair or maybe both.
Don't look at my belly.
You're free.
Yeah, right.
-Hello?
Listen, Larry, I need you to do something for me, and I don't wanna talk about it.
I need you to find out if Alex Vause named me at her trial.
But wait, my dad said the testimony was sealed.
Why the sudden interest?
This is really important to me.
And I don't wanna talk about it.
And my mother told me that my eggs are getting old.
That's the ghetto.
What?
They got you in the ghetto.
I am nobody's cleaning lady and I make honor cube every week, so you do your part and then some.
My floor's my pride, so no shoes, leave them off before you step in.
And I see that nonsense go down in the cafeteria.
I don't care if you're gay or what, but you bring any drama in here and we'll have trouble.
-What's happening?
Do you understand these rights as I just read 'em to you?
Yes.
With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?
Service.
Look...
I know.
Why?
What's going on?
We're doing it today.
It's today.
I'll be there in a minute, mate.
John, I've told you to keep the doors locked.
As a matter of fact, he's doing me today.
Make sure he's done you by nine.
Watch John, cos he has so many depending on him.
Watch Arthur because he's as likely to hurt himself as anyone else.
I used to do that every morning during the war.
I hoped I'd done it for the last time.
Today will be the last time, Poll.
After today, there'll be no need for prayers.
We'll be set.
Family meeting, half ten.
Mr Zhang said you are special, special customer.
Do you want to sit?
And...this.
So tight.
We can also clean and press your shirt while we do this.
That's a very efficient service.
You never been to a place like this before?
It's OK.
Sometimes old men who have lost their wives, they come here... all the time.
Old men?
I am so old?
Whore.
'That is not only treason, 'it is disgusting beyond all measure.
'Your father would be ashamed of you.
'You have betrayed every principle 'and standard of honour that was your birthright.
Love.
For the suits.
You want to hear something funny?
I am unarmed.
It's curious, Inspector.
You're no different from any other copper that came before you.
I'm no different from those who would follow should I choose to leave.
And you still don't know how we found them, do you?
One thing I have learned... ..is that you and I are opposites, but also just the same.
Like an image in a mirror.
We hate people.
And they in turn hate us.
And fear us.
Before the day is over, your heart will be broken... ..just the same as mine.
Men like us, Mr Shelby... ..will always be alone.
And what love we get... ..we will have to pay for.
Enjoy your day.
He settles quicker with me cos he can't smell the milk.
Well, you never knew my children, did you?
No, I was a child myself, then.
You never talk about them.
My heart breaks even when I think about them.
They were three and five years old.
Sally was three, Michael was five.
Well... two weeks away from being six.
They'd been stolen in a robbery, and they said some porter at the hotel had been coshed.
And a woman from round here told the police about the sheets - jealous, you see, of the new sheets.
And when the police came, they found a spirit still for making a few drops of gin.
And for that... ..they took my children from me.
And they never told me where they took them.
But they will never take your baby away from you.
Cos Tommy wouldn't let them.
Cos Tommy won't let them walk all over us.
Now it is Tommy who has given strength and power to this family.
Cos he knows... ..you have to be as bad as them above in order to survive.
I'm telling you this cos I want you to forgive him.
How can I?
When my Freddie's rotting in jail because of him.
There's something about today you need to know.
All right, Freddie, time to go.
I want to get a message to Campbell.
I can't let them move me to Brixton.
If I go to Brixton, they'll kill me.
On your feet.
I told the Prime Minister personally that the guns had been retrieved and he actually heard me and listened, and I'm pretty sure he gave me a half smile.
He never usually smiles unless a political opponent dies.
I plan to put your name forward in the New Year's Honours list...
Was she involved in the discovery?
Does she deserve some kind of commendation?
And that is what the record should state.
And what of the men who actually stole the guns?
The Peaky...
If we were to make arrests, the whole thing would end up in open court, and I know we wish to keep this matter confidential.
So they'll go free?
Not quite, sir.
You see, I have plans for the Peaky Blinders.
This is the day we become respectable.
The day we join the official National Association... of Race Course Bookmakers.
We're going to the Worcester races.
The track opens at one, we get there at two.
Now, Kimber thinks we're going there to help him fight the Lee brothers.
But thanks to the efforts of our John, and his lovely new wife Esme, the Lees are now our kin.
We take them out, then leave the bookies.
I expect a swift victory which will send a signal all the way to London, that we believe in letting legitimate businesses run peacefully.
Any other questions?
Oh, does anyone object if I bring a newcomer to the meeting?
I'd like to introduce the newest member of the Shelby clan.
Welcome home, Ada.
We named him Karl.
If what Aunt Polly says is true, you are.
It's true.
Thank you, Tommy.
So, who the hell are you?
Someone who wants to keep his eyes.
Peaky blinders.
What the bloody hell is that?
Looks like your friends are here.
Make it look good.
I am sorry about this, comrade.
Holy shit.
All right, lads, listen up.
You have a pint and a chaser, no more.
On the house.
The next family meeting, I'll make sure you're there.
That could change.
Oh, is this how it's going to be, eh?
You waiting at home for me, saying, "What time do you call this?"
The barrel needs changing.
Go on, Tommy, go out the back, give her a good seeing to before we go.
Tommy, we need more mild!
Just help yourselves.
Tommy, the truth is when you come back from the races, I won't be here.
What are you talking about?
And I'm going to close down some of that other stuff.
Maybe open a club, hey?
And another thing.
I am going to make a success of this.
And I'm not talking about marriage.
We're the same...
Tommy, I have done something terrible to you.
Right, tell him what you just told me.
Just heard there's two vans driving up the Stratford Road.
What's going on?
We've been fucking betrayed.
Who else knew today was the day you were moving on Kimber?
There's only one thing can blind a man as smart as you, Tommy.
I'll deal with Grace.
If you set eyes on her again, you might kill her.
Going for good?
Tommy knows as well.
Turned out that copper as good as told him this morning.
But I wanted to hear it from your own lips.
I am an agent of the crown.
I have the power to arrest and the right to use force.
So, please, step out of my way.
Like I say, instinct's a funny thing.
You fell for Tommy for real, didn't you?
This gun is loaded.
I'm not afraid of you.
So, who are you?
Rich girl, I'd guess.
I'll fight you with my fists and show you how a rich girl fights.
I'm from a tough family, too.
We women have more sense.
Why don't you pour us both a drink?
So, am I right?
Did you fall for Tommy?
I think he'll try to kill me.
That's why we're drinking, not fighting.
What was he like...before France?
He laughed, a lot.
He wanted to work with horses.
He won medals.
Threw them in the cut.
Ah, not a single man came back the same.
You know, after all this is over... ..he might forgive you.
I will never forgive you.
And it's me who runs the business of the heart in this family.
And as far as I'm concerned, you're a snitch from the Parish.
Now, go.
Maybe what really upsets you is the thought that one day you might lose him.
And how come all our police have disappeared?
Because it was the police who told Kimber about our plan.
And who told the police?
All right, men... ..you were mostly in the war, so you know that battle plans always change and get fucked up.
And we'll have no help from the law today.
That pub there is called the Garrison.
Well, now it really is one.
And it belongs to us, right?
So I reckon we're outnumbered three to one.
But can you ask him from me if you can help us today?
God says he don't deal with Small Heath, sir.
We've had a report of a large group of men in vehicles heading towards the city.
Most of them are known to the police, sir.
We think a gang fight's about to break out.
What the hell is going on?
And then we shall pick the bones.
She's gone, then?
You're not accustomed to not getting what you want, are you, Tommy?
You wanted my pub and you took it.
You got a fair price.
What I got was an ultimatum.
Like you give to everybody.
I think, what it is... you're bad men, but you're our bad men.
Will you go looking for her?
She's in the past.
The past is not my concern.
The future is no longer my concern, either.
What is your concern, Tommy?
The one minute.
The soldier's minute.
In a battle, that's all you get.
One minute of everything at once.
And anything before is nothing.
Everything after... nothing.
Nothing in comparison... to that one minute.
Didn't you get enough minutes over there?
Seems not, doesn't it?
Tommy, they're here.
Get your weapons out, boys, and load 'em up.
Take your time.
Hold 'em up in the air so as they can see what we've got.
All guns and no balls, right, Billy boy?
So, what do we do now?
Just give the order.
The men that have arrived in Garrison Lane are armed with rifles.
Did you hear me?
Their methods of self-destruction are not my concern.
Well, we've also had report of machine gun fire in Saltleigh.
The ravings of an old soldier with shell shock.
We only found 24 of those 25 Lewis guns.
If they were to get to use the one...
You know, when, er... when you came here from Belfast I was overjoyed.
I was sick of this force, and I was sick of all the corruption.
You said it was the devil's work to look the other way.
I am not looking the other way, Sergeant Moss.
I am looking directly at the events of the day.
And I like what I see.
It doesn't have to be like this, Kimber.
We have to use guns... let's use proper guns.
Sergeant Thorne reporting for duty, sir.
You were saying something about being out-gunned.
Have you lost your mind?
I said shut up!
Now, I'm wearing black in preparation.
I want you to look at me.
I want you all to look at me.
Who'll be wearing black for you?
Think about them.
And fight if you want to, but that baby ain't moving anywhere.
And neither am I.
She's right, you know.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Hold your guns up!
Enough.
Kimber and me fought this battle one on one.
It's over.
Go home to your families.
Scudboat, Curly...pick him up.
I told him... ..that his heart would be broken before the day was over.
So, it seems... ..you've broken two hearts, Grace.
As well as my own.
Have a drink.
Now we can bury him properly in the grave we dug for him.
To Danny Whizz-Bang.
Well?
A Mr William Kimber has been found dead with a gunshot wound.
Also, the communist agitator Freddie Thorne was taken from his transport by armed men.
Since there were no police officers on the street at the time... following your orders... he managed to escape easily and is now at large.
I mean, we could go down there and make a few arrests but, er, no-one will have seen anything.
A toast, to Shelby Limited!
Could you put me through to Mr Churchill, please?
Yes, sir.
Everyone's leaving town.
What exactly can I say?
I don't know, Grace.
I could tell you who I really am.
I think I know who you are.
And you know who I am.
The circumstance is not important.
Circumstance?
Is all it is.
Here it comes, Tommy.
I love you.
And there it goes, Grace.
We can say it as much as we like... ..but there's no chance.
I'll be in London one week.
I have an idea.
Not whisky.
If you check behind the bar... you will find a bottle of champagne.
The one she bought.
Today was a good day.
All of Kimber's men were busy here, so the Lee boys took all the pitches at the Worcester races.
It couldn't have gone better if we'd planned it.
Shelby Brothers Limited are now the third largest legal race track operation in the country.
And all my family is here to celebrate.
There'll be others.
To the others.
All of them.
'The idea of New York is interesting 'but I have worked so hard for this day, 'for this victory.
'I have responsibilities here 'for people I need to protect and people who I love.
'Polly tells me you fell in love for real 'and Polly is never wrong about matters of the heart.
'I will give you my decision within three days.
Carroll was convicted in 2004 for the murders of 14 young women.
We need you in Virginia, Ryan.
Even though you slept with my wife.
I have so many surprises waiting for you.
Olivia, I require legal counsel.
Do not bring me into this any further.
We're just getting started.
If you want to see Joey, get in now.
Do not move.
Be right back.
Don't move!
Joey, we're here to help you.
I'm with Roderick.
Where are we?
I thought we were going to see my mom.
We are, but I need to meet a friend first.
I don't know.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Hello?
I was told to come here.
I know.
It's about time you showed up.
My name is Bo.
Go pull your truck in there.
I have to go use the bathroom.
Through the office.
Come back, come back, come back!
As I'm sure you're aware, warden, this is a clear violation of my client's eighth amendment rights.
We have case law precedence, federal tort and civil liberties claims.
Just exactly what do you want, Miss Warren?
He said his name was Charlie, and he told me that he was hired to follow me and to report back to Joe.
He had photos and video, and he-- he said he was gonna take me to Joey.
He had this honor about him like hew as living up to some code of conduct, definitely military.
Marines or army or something.
Thank you.
Cult leaders often have a second in command, someone to oversee, manages the cult.
Do you even know how many people are involved in this?
I mean, are we talking fans or prison groupies or people with serious mental disorders?
Miss Matthews, can I count on you not to engage with any more of Joe's followers?
No, you can't, not any more than I can count on you to find my son.
When is Charlie coming?
There you are.
You okay?
She's none of your business.
You don't go back there, okay?
You understand?
Stay right here.
Why don't we just wait?
Less talking and... just wait.
I understand that some lines may have been crossed, but this doesn't make any sense.
This is on you, Mr. Hardy.
Joe Carroll, you've been remanded into the custody of the Jesup County federal correctional facility of the state of Georgia.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Well, I couldn't let you leave without saying a proper good-bye.
So why the transfer, Joe?
What's in Georgia?
Was she upset?
Every great love must be tested after all.
We need to take him down for processing.
The US Marshals are supervising the transfer.
I will make sure nothing goes wrong.
So how do you know Roderick?
I do things for him from time to time.
What kind of things?
Let me get you out.
I knew you'd come back.
Do you know Joe Carroll?
I know who he is, but I'm not a part of his little club.
Where's the kid?
You come back here!
Come here!
I'm not gonna hurt you, Joey.
Joey, come here.
What'd you find out?
The warden's got a teenage daughter enrolled in college.
Warden Montero.
Mr. Hardy, I understand that you're here at the behest of the FBI, but you're skating on very thin ice.
Do not push me.
Why do we have to wait here?
What about that guy Bo?
Is he part of this?
When we set up the web site, we found a lot of people like Bo, useful but in a limited way.
He's not part of everything, and he won't be coming with us.
He's got that girl in a cage.
The girl is very important.
You know the people there?
A few.
Some of my buddies that I signed up with, friends of Roderick's.
What happened to them?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
We do what we have to do.
Run it again.
Pull it up, the same point, exiting the sally port.
The warden hijacked the surveillance footage.
Ryan, the warden just left the building, said he was taking the rest of the day off.
Get Parker on the phone now.
Open up.
I'm not really authorized to do that, ma'am.
It's not a request.
What the hell is your problem?
What did you do?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Open the trunk.
Thank you, Olivia.
She's my daughter.
They're gonna kill her.
Cuff him.
We need a current location for Olivia Warren, Joe Carroll's lawyer.
You seem a bit nervous, Olivia.
That's because I'm presently committing at least 7 felonies.
How much further?
Just a few more minutes.
You're not supposed to be out here.
Denise thinks I'm reading my book.
She said you were going to take me to see my mom.
Doesn't sound like you believe her.
She's telling you the truth.
I was just with your mom, you know?
What happened?
I screwed up, and, let the bad guys get in the way.
What's really going on?
What do you want to know?
That girl, will she be okay?
Would it make you feel better if I promise you she'll be okay?
I give you my word, all right?
I don't think anyone followed us.
I admire your positive attitude, Olivia, but I don't share your optimism.
There's, one more thing I need you to do for me.
What is it?
I'll connect you now.
Olivia, where are you?
Is-- is Joe Carroll with you?
Say these exact words to him--
- What's going on?
Tell him he can kill me.
FBI!
Anybody see anything?
You see him?
Go that way.
I'm David.
It's a pleasure, sir.
Weston, he's up there!
I'm Louise, sir.
Nice to meet you, Louise.
This is most baffling.
You, me, us here in this moment?
What do I do?
I kill you?
Now?
Really, you must admit it's a quandary, hmm?
I so very much want you to live and see all that's about to happen.
I've meticulously planned all of it with a little help from my friends.
That's a Beatles reference, by the way.
But I must say very, very much going according to plan.
We should leave now, sir.
There is so much more to come, Ryan.
I'll be in touch.
Call me when you're gone, and then I'll let him go.
Don't even think about it.
You can't kill me.
Didn't you hear what Joe just said?
He wants me alive.
Then I'll shoot you in the leg.
It's gonna take us a few hours to get there.
You need anything else?
Need a word in private.
The helicopter they used wasn't registered.
Local airport radar had them for a short time, but they lost them.
Warden Montero's in federal custody.
Anyone locate his daughter?
They're nameless, faceless.
We'll find them and break them.
Let's start with this guy, right now.
I can't let you hurt him, Ryan.
If we're gonna end this, if we're gonna find Joe, we're gonna find his son, the rest of them, we got to start doing things a different way.
I'll give you 5 minutes.
I'm not gonna tell you anything.
That's good to know.
It's okay now.
Protective custody.
It's for your own safety.
And my son?
I'm not giving up, Claire.
That's what he wants, but he's not gonna win.
This isn't a game, Ryan.
This is my life, this is my son's life!
Come on.
It's okay.
Hey, Joey.
Previously, on Warehouse 13...
You've never met that guy, and I don't ever want you to.
Charlotte Dupres, who, as it turns out, is a rival of mine.
If I blow your heart out of your chest, you think that'll stop you?
My lying, cheating husband is once again out in the world.
Good morning, Mrs. LaBelle.
Hi, Terry.
Oh, my God.
His name was Terry Chambers, district attorney in Marlon, Ohio... poisoned out of nowhere in his driveway this morning.
Arsenic in his coffee?
No, he hadn't eaten anything in eight hours, and there were no visible track marks.
Cause of death... muscle paralysis and lungs collapsed and heart attack.
He's at his yearly physical.
Yeah, wait till you hit over 50, and the real fun begins.
What is that?
Oh, this is the last of the stuff that I had at my mom's.
Yeah, she needed the space.
You got a flight in an hour, so...
Hey, Steve, do you smell...?
Yes, I do.
Oh, no, this is my breakfast.
Yeah, don't you think?
Because Abigail and I... we were gonna flush out the neutralizer annex, but if you would really rather stay...
Yeah, I would love to just unpack all that junk.
Yeah, but wouldn't you rather do that after they flush out the neutralizer?
Yes, and I could use a little bit of action in the field.
And I think you and I rather hit our stride chasing Beethoven's bust, so shall we?
All right, Bilbo Baggins, you're on.
Okay, what are you doing?
Nothing.
Grip strength is the first muscle to go.
Well, I know how important that is to you.
Can I help you?
Yeah, we're looking for Terry Chambers' house.
Ooh, Secret Service, huh?
I recognize that badge from the website.
Are you here about the DA's death?
Uh, Hummingbird Lane, you make a left... 2141, okay?
I'm here for backup.
Jeez, this place looks like a '50s TV show.
What?
I have to do the other side.
Secret Service.
Okay, you want to go?
Gated communities... for when you really miss boot camp.
A guy is dead, and all they care about are parking rules.
- Talk about twisted priorities!
- Okay, what is going on?
First your hand-exercise thing, and now... then you yell at an old guy?
Okay, Mykes...
Oh, well, that means...
Janice Malloy... 26, right over there.
And you are?
Do you think it was murder?
I certainly hope not, but with what happened a few nights ago...
- To the DA?
- You haven't heard?
The DA forgot to park his car in his garage, and somebody broke his windshield.
Nobody saw who, but we all saw the windshield.
26, right over there, if I can help you in any way.
He did all of this in a trance?
Yeah, and according to two witnesses, radiating some kind of light.
So when do we meet Nick?
Well, maybe we should go to his home, talk to his parents?
Nick's got no parents or a home.
He lives over there.
Lost the lease.
So, Rodger, do you know if your stepdad brought home anything old or antique-y lately?
Well, it's Rodge, and... and I don't know.
What about his windshield?
We heard somebody broke it a few nights ago.
Are you guys... are you guys really Secret Service?
- Look, Rodger...
- Rodge.
Well, he sent 6 men to death row in 15 years.
Because I just thought he had a stroke.
We're just covering our angles.
Right.
Uh, thanks...
They found sodium thiopental, Pavulon, and potassium chloride in his blood... all of which are used in lethal injections.
All right, so maybe it's some kind of execution artifact in the hands of a grieving death row family member.
Right, I'll get Steve to look into those death row cases.
I'll go look into that.
Hey, hey, what's going on?
So, Spencer, this is not your home?
Uh, yeah, just, uh, working.
Yeah.
Uh, Spencer's this, um, crazy web guru, and, um, I have this candle business and...
Have... have you two crazy kids come into contact with any strange objects lately?
- No, I...
- What about DA Chambers?
Have you... have you crossed paths with DA Chambers?
Well, my husband, Gerry, worked for the DA's office before he got fired a few days ago.
I know it sounds insane, but they're totally joined at the waist, like siamese twins.
And I'm thinking, coo-coo-coo-choo, Mrs. Robinson.
So you think she was fooling around with this younger guy?
I thought that they were working on their laptops.
So, while his computer may have been off, his laptop was definitely on.
So Mr. LaBelle gets fired by DA Chambers and then finds out that his wife is cheating on him with this... this kid.
Unless he has two artifacts.
Yeah, well, that's what the goo smells like after it neutralizes an artifact.
Relieving the pressure helps normalize it.
So did you unpack your stuff?
It suddenly occurred to me that literally my entire life is here now.
- I got to think about this.
Oh, God.
No, no, no, thanks.
So, Nick, it happened again, huh?
Why, so you'll think I'm crazy too?
I don't think you're crazy.
Well, you have no reason to believe everything I say, but I did go through the system, and I'm not a fan.
I know it can suck.
Minneapolis, three months... wouldn't recommend it in February.
And even that was warmer than the psych ward.
But, buddy, you got to talk to me first.
I don't know what happens.
This thing's frying his brain?
Essentially, yeah.
Yeah, that should be fun news to deliver.
Mr. LaBelle, it's Rex in security.
Mr. LaBelle, it's Secret Service.
Mr. LaBelle?
What's this about, Rex?
Common misconception... running does not make you look innocent.
Today is not the day to test him.
- Now, where's the artifact?
I didn't use anything, I swear.
I-I just broke his windshield.
How did... with who?
Do my kids know?
You smell that?
Something's burning.
Dude, you're on fire.
Pete, need to stand back!
Okay, Mykes, we... we got to find this thing.
I mean, with burns like those, that guy could still die.
LaBelle clearly did not know that his wife was cheating on him.
So, okay, what do we know?
We got... we got three victims from three different attacks which may or may not have come from the same artifact.
Toodles.
I'll get us some tea.
Mykes, you got to try these cookies.
No, I don't think so.
As in with fire?
Guess that's karma for me trying to mooch free advice.
Or they put their guards up, which is why I quit.
No, it's not.
I meant to say it's one of the reasons why I quit.
I guess I don't like to talk about it.
You don't have to.
- Step into my office.
Physician know thyself, right?
So how did you end up here?
I was in Burma photographing political prisoners when I met Adwin Kosan.
Well, I guess that's what we have in common.
We're a bunch of lonely misfit toys that the Warehouse collects.
Except now you have each other.
Maybe that's why you're so anxious about your things arriving.
How do you mean?
Well, you said you were worried about not having someone to share you life with.
Now it seems to me like you might have four special, unique someones.
And for now, they might be your one.
And it might be time for you to share a little more of yourself with them, which can be scary.
Artie said you were good.
None of these equations seem to be solving anything.
"For all 'T' not equal to 'S'"... what the hell?
I hate having only one clue.
Is he always like this?
So what is this place anyway?
Uh, it looks like it might have been an old NSA safe house.
Now they obviously use it to shoot porn.
Hey, that's St. Jude, right?
Patron saint of lost causes.
Where'd you get this?
And Mrs. I said that I should pray to St. Jude if I ever had nightmares.
I need one of those.
Do you mind if I...?
Like a never-ending sci-fi miniseries... about the psych ward, about my brother being lost, and more recently about this guy.
- Here, I need you.
- Sit tight.
Can I get the tweeted version?
Banks hire physicists and statisticians so they can create numerical price-hedging models.
- Like derivatives.
Nice.
Nick says that he feels as if he's being transported to another space, right?
I see a man's hands.
Yeah, what... what are they doing?
What are they doing?
They're doing what I'm doing.
Yeah, they're mirroring his actions... what else?
Artie, he's already seizing.
The downside of the artifact is intensifying.
We have to stop this.
All right, hold him, hold him.
It's the only thing that would let that paranoid dictator actually sleep.
All right, so there's got to be some connection between Rex and the other victims.
Well, maybe they all stumbled on to some secret, and now they're paying the price for it.
Mykes, doesn't it seem kind of weirdly lucky that the fire didn't touch any of his expensive electronics?
Janice did say that Rex was waiting for a settlement from his insurance company, right?
It says that they found traces of boric acid in his power outlets.
Boric acid?
Rex burned the same color.
So this is a cause-and-effect artifact.
One was an arsonist, the other two adulterers... all being punished with their own sins.
Yeah, but what about DA Chambers?
It was his job to put people away.
Unless he did something unethical during a murder case which resulted in a lethal injection.
So we need to start telling Steve to research sin-related artifacts?
Yeah, and we need to figure out who in this town is so obsessed with morality that...
Colonel Cassel?
Yes, yes, we're at 106 Woodpecker Crescent.
- How is what happening?
- Somebody knows.
That's why they're doing this to me.
Somebody knows what?
Did you do something illegal or... or immoral in your past?
There could be a connection.
We gassed the whole village, killed 'em all in their sleep... women, children.
I don't know.
Just try and breathe.
Mykes, someone here is doing this.
Well, we better find out who before we have a mass exodus and we lose this artifact for good.
How is he?
We can't let this kid die, Jinksy.
So you think that this artifact is tethering him to a quant somewhere and doing his math?
Yeah, his mind seems to be going wherever the quant is.
He described an office.
You think this quant is nearby, or is he affecting Nick at a distance?
Well, it theoretically could be anywhere.
The brooch that Queen Isabella gave Columbus... that could make you brave from across an ocean.
Well, we're hoping the quant is closer, obviously.
Nick said he saw a clock with an antelope, so I've been cross-checking with New York investment houses.
Okay, what about Sir Isaac Newton's cravat?
It gives the wearer insight if you wipe it across your forehead.
The downside... it increases your gravitational pull till you can't move.
It does not create a psychic link.
Okay, uh, we started with sin-related and ended up at biblical artifacts and the closest we got to divine punishment was an obscure version of the Sodom And Gomorrah story.
It says that when Sodom was razed for its sins, a windstorm buried it in the salt dunes that made it so wealthy.
But why is somebody targeting these specific people?
I mean, is it just because they live here?
Or because they sinned?
I got it.
- What?
So maybe a disgruntled resident is targeting board members.
Yes, but why?
And Rex the security guard is not on this list.
Here...
Pete, just be careful.
And did you hear from Steve?
No, but I did find an article crediting Armstrong's algorithmic trading quantitative analysts for their recent success... "ATQ."
Nick, Nick, can you hear me?
Can you tell me what you see?
I'm in the same office as before.
Frosted glass and... and desks.
They've all got frosted glass and desks.
Nick, what else?
Artie, I don't know... he keeps hearing "Kill The Wabbit."
"Kill The Wabbit"?
You're killing a young boy by wearing them.
Come on, Artie!
Are you okay?
Lucy, you've got some "splaining" to do.
Well, that was way more testosterone-y than picking a lock.
John Foster?
Hey, Mykes.
I think I know who has the artifact.
Last week the board rejected, for the third time, a petition from Janice Malloy.
She wanted to erect a bust of her late husband, the founder of Crown Heights.
What about Rex?
Rex spoke out against the bust, saying it would "Tempt vandals for no good reason."
So Janice is doing this whole thing over a bust?
She might be doing it to John Foster right now.
The salt, Pete.
Pete, w-what if the handful of artifacts that were created by the windstorm weren't the objects that the salt covered, but the salt itself?
What if it's imbued with some sort of power?
Pete, don't move, okay?
Okay, I won't, 'cause I don't think I can.
Oh, my God, the salt... the salt covered a person's face and took its shape.
Shut up!
Get back!
Our whole marriage is about this place, down to naming the streets after our favorite birds!
Give me the mask.
Just save it, Janice.
It's getting worse.
Colonel Cassel, what happened?
They sent me home.
As soon as I left you, I started feeling fi... good lord.
Is he all right?
No, just go and please call an ambulance!
Okay, so we just... we just have to figure out what happened when he left us.
I think I'm just gonna wait till the ambulance comes.
You can't wait for the ambulance, okay?
The only thing that will work is a confession, all right?
I lost control of the car.
I hit a tree, but I walked away.
I walked away, not a... not a damn scratch.
I did that.
I haven't taken any.
I've never been able to forgive myself.
Just listen to me, okay?
You have come so far since then, okay?
You are a completely different person now.
- You think so?
So can I go now?
You're not gonna call social services?
Well, like you said, we don't really do that, and I would never do that, but where are you gonna go?
South Dakota?
- Why would I do that?
- Just for a couple days... so we can monitor whatever the residual effects of this might be, and then when we're done, we'll fly you back to wherever you want to go to start over.
And I think I've earned a little trust at this point, haven't I?
Look, Nick, I know the worst part about where you are right now is that feeling that nobody cares.
So why don't you let me pay forward what was done for me?
What's that?
- Taking your own advice.
She did.
Nick is just between places right now, so I convinced Artie to let him stay for a couple of days.
After all, this is a BB, and where is my Steve?
And what is that wonderful smell?
Oh, you know, it was... the usual... snag, bag, tag.
- Oh, that looks so...
It turns out I am gay.
- Mykes, when's your physical?
The doctor will see you now, Ms. Bering.
Did you hear what I said?
I said we could be looking at ovarian cancer.
If they have no control over what's going on, if it's all about this spell, there's no reason to do anything crazy.
Is it gonna help Juliette remember me?
It's the first step of what you're gonna have to go through to break the spell between Juliette and the Captain.
They can't help him.
It's the only way to stop what's going on between you and him.
You didn't explain to her what we have to do here?
How can I explain something I don't fully understand?
No, no, you can't do that, Juliette.
Listen, you know I'm Nick's friend, right, and I would never do anything to hurt him.
He asked you here for a reason.
Nick is doing this for you.
Tell me the part that you can explain.
Remember that cat that scratched... oh, my God, I don't want to hear anything else about the cat.
- How long did it take to come out of it?
You know how you have feelings for Captain Renard and you can't explain where they came from?
- There are a lot of things in the human body, hormonal and chemical, that can trigger these inexplicable, emotional nuclear meltdowns.
And what we're dealing with is sort of a "pheromone gone wild" fiasco.
All we're attempting to do is to reverse the pheromoniacal behavior before something even worse happens.
Okay, he's coming out of it.
Can you hear us?
Okay, great.
So that's it?
And there's one more thing you have to do too.
Probably best if they don't know about this part.
What is that?
Just a flavoring to cut the bitterness.
Can we just get this over with?
This better work.
Now what?
Well, I think the alone was a step in the right direction.
I'm gonna make sure she stays alone.
How's the clock business?
The hands of time put pennies in the pocket.
Ancient Chinese proverb.
Don't move!
Stay down.
Down on the floor!
I said, "get on the floor."
Get everything!
Just shut the hell up and stay down so I can see.
Can you see this?
Candy from a baby.
Now apparently there's six more of these that people are hunting all over the world.
You need to collect all seven to complete the map and find whatever it is they hid back in the 12th century.
You know, if I hadn't seen what I've seen, I wouldn't believe any of this.
- Neither would I.
- All right, let me get this as straight as I can.
The Captain is a member of a royal family.
Yeah, that's where they gonna put us if this thing goes on much longer.
Where you gonna keep that key now?
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.
What about Juliette?
Crap.
They were all wearing these masks... horrible, so realistic.
They were all wearing some kind of animal masks.
You were here?
Bigger than robbing a bank in the middle of the day?
I mean, you break the code, you put all wesen in danger.
Look, this is a huge Grimm thing too.
It's in German.
Bottom line, very bad things happen when wesen reveal themselves in order to take advantage of normal folk.
And if you think that can't happen again, here today, think again.
The fact that these guys were wesen when they robbed the bank is gonna make it impossible to find them.
Yeah, and your testimony about two blutbaden and a skalengeck should go over really well with a jury.
Okay, let's see if we can find any recent cases where masks were used.
When this gets out it is gonna spread fast, and a lot of wesen are gonna freak.
And when you get the wesen community freaked, somebody is gonna know somebody who knows somebody who knows something.
An auto supply shop in Eastport Plaza, and a convenience store in Troutdale.
Oh, so they're moving up in the world.
You still having feelings for Juliette?
I'm truly grateful for that.
I have no intention of leaving.
Well, good, 'cause I don't want you to.
There are things far more important than what goes on here.
I've protected you in situations you're not even aware of.
You want a bouquet?
You need to understand your place in all of this.
If you and I could overcome our differences, we will make history.
How much have you told Hank?
Pretty much everything.
And he's on board with that?
He's working it out.
Okay, probably better that way.
If anybody knows who these guys are, it'll be somebody in there.
Don't do anything until we get there.
Yeah, you don't have to worry about that.
What makes you think anybody's gonna talk?
Well, it's worth a shot.
I can do this alone.
I'll be out in ten minutes.
Did you hear about that bank robbery today?
I gotta be honest, the thing I like about this place, you come in by yourself, you sit down, you strike up a conversation.
Hell of a bank robbery today, huh?
Me either.
The guy with the green jacket.
That guy was in the bank.
That's cute.
As I recall, you're the one who was cowardly.
Kept my mouth shut.
I think that's worth something.
His ten minutes were up two minutes ago.
Let's give him a couple more.
Just in case he's making some headway.
Shut that music off!
Hey, get your hands off me!
What'd you say to me?
Hey, you're not going anywhere!
Get out your I.D.s.
Well, then I suggest we all go home.
Starting with you.
Lucky for us a couple of handsome Detectives were cruising by.
We're just getting warmed up.
On my way.
These are bad times, you know?
People out of work, can't pay their mortgages.
All it would take is a few more clowns with the same idea, and I can't even think what would happen.
You sound just like my brother.
And that's a good thing?
Freddy made a lot of mistakes, but when it came to doing what's best for the wesen community, he never wavered.
Did you arrest them?
I recognized the tall one when he wogied.
Can't present that to the D.A., but at least we know who they are.
I think he slipped out when you guys came on.
- That was the third guy?
- I think so.
Not much we can do until we get evidence to tie them to the bank.
If you can't get the hard evidence you need, you might just have to put the badge aside and deal with this as a Grimm.
No.
God, no.
I'm hoping it doesn't come to that.
Can you believe that loser tried to shake us down?
You should have killed him right there, baby.
I would have if the cops hadn't shown.
And Gus crawled out like a little baby.
- They were cops.
Nobody can touch us.
Come on, show me what you got.
Okay, it looks fine.
We gotta work this out, Cole.
This is Pritchard's address.
Doesn't look like anybody's here.
No place like home.
Alone?
Does the monster have a name?
They don't want anybody to know.
When do the monsters come here?
Whenever they want.
Think they're still using this place?
If they still think it's safe.
Screw it.
Everything's a lot better.
Thank you for calling.
Thanks so much.
Then, uh, good night, Juliette.
Good night, Nick.
Everybody on the ground!
What are you doing?
Leave the money, Paul!
And I figured, you know, it's our first sort of breakfast as roommates, so why not pull out all the stops?
- How can you be so sure?
- Well, I'm still here.
No.
Yeah, it's sort of a council of justice, you know, for wesen.
Oh, you know, just "penalty of death" seriously.
You spying on me, old man?
I'll cut your tongue out.
Surveillance?
Man, we scored big-time.
We got more than we did last time!
I'll be right with you.
And how much longer until they realize they're not wearing masks?
This is not a job for the police, we need the council.
We'll be chased from our homes.
I need your help.
So that happened this morning in the southeast, and we got this one a half-hour later.
This is getting out of control fast.
Nick tells me you know what's going on.
Let's just say I've been initiated.
Welcome to the club.
We need to get on top of this, or we're gonna have a riot on our hands.
I was really young the last time this happened.
I remember, my parents, my aunts and uncles were panicked, just like now.
They wouldn't let me or Freddy go outside.
Not even near a window.
The only one who wasn't panicked was my dad.
I don't know what happened, but after about a week, my dad walked into the shop and said it was over.
That's it?
I never knew exactly what happened.
When Freddy turned 18, my dad told him something.
He said that our father had an uneasy alliance with the council.
They did things that he didn't agree with, but he did what he had to do.
And Freddy took over for my dad, and I was supposed to take over for him if anything ever happened, because he never had any kids.
This is it.
Freddy told me that our dad served on the council at one point.
Before we were born, I think.
How do we know they even still deal with this kind of thing?
We don't, but I have to call.
My name is Rosalee calvert.
I'm the daughter of George calvert and the sister of Frederick calvert.
I'm reporting a violation of the gesetzbuch ehrenkodex.
Wait a minute.
Where?
I think I got something on Gus.
Last name Campbell.
Two years ago, he shared a cell with Cole Pritchard.
We gotta lay low.
Let me explain it to you so you understand.
You serious?
We gotta show them it can be done.
This was supposed to just be a couple of easy scores.
Oh, it's just the beginning.
You see, what you're feeling is power, gussy.
I'm taking my share, and I'm getting out before you get us all killed.
Don't you walk away.
Cole, stop!
It's clear.
It's gone viral, and the infection is spreading.
Every generation requires a reminder that our safety is fragile.
Hank.
You gotta arrest me, it's the law.
Looks like we got all the proof we need.
Captain Renard, what can you tell us about the masked bank robbers?
The arrests have been made, and the fugitives are being brought into the precinct now.
We're just the beginning of what's coming.
- Local hire.
Not a one.
I am having feelings for another man, and I don't know why.
I think Adalind had something to do with you getting beat up.
You have 48 hours to get the key from Nick.
And why am I not refusing?
Because if you don't, the Grimm will be told of your real identity.
In a storage yard.
Who it was who came into the spice shop with Juliette.
If anyone has any information in regards to the symbol or the killing of Mr. Zayne, please contact the Portland police bureau.
Your girlfriend and your boss?
That's about as gnarly as it gets.
- Monroe, move out of the way.
Where?
In the parking lot near the deluxe hotel.
Oh, that quadruple homicide.
That's why I called you.
That should do it.
I can do that.
Well, maybe whoever they went up against was supposed to be the victim.
So much for safety in numbers.
I think there's probably a lot more to this.
Yeah, I remember.
If these dead guys are all members of the same lodge, it's not one I want to belong to.
Look, I can't talk right now.
No, please, I-I need you to come over.
How do you want to handle this?
Well, until we get the prints back and I.D. these guys, we don't have a lot of places to go.
I'll have the guys check surveillance in the area, see if we get lucky.
They must have underestimated whoever they went up against.
Yeah?
Yeah, bring it in.
Covers the entry on 15th ave.
This was taken at 10:37 tonight.
Watch this guy.
Do we really think that guy took down these four?
Maybe he had help.
And maybe he had nothing to do with it.
Yeah, just a headache.
Why don't you get out of here, Captain?
- Oh, Rosalee.
Yeah, it means Nick's not in a very good place right now.
I mean, I got a nice room for him and everything... no, that's not what I'm talking about.
I think Nick's Captain must have been the one that woke Juliette up.
What, from her coma?
He has to have been the one that broke her spell.
And that would explain their obsessive behavior.
Then she really does have no idea what she's doing.
Oh, man, how am I supposed to deal with this without you?
My bus gets in at 8:20 in the morning, and I was wondering...
I am picking you up.
I can't wait to see you.
Oh, you have no idea.
What happens if I let you in?
I don't know.
I can't talk.
Nick, you gotta get back here.
I just talked to Rosalee about what's going on.
Monroe, not now.
Nick, Rosalee is coming home tomorrow.
She thinks the Captain is the one who woke Juliette up, okay?
Which means he's the one who saved her life.
How would she know that?
Because it explains their behavior... their obsessive-compulsive, overwhelming sexual attraction to each other.
You know what?
Too much.
Your Captain came to the shop because he wanted to get rid of these feelings.
And Juliette must have wanted the same thing because she came with him.
And he said it was possible.
So it's not like they just fell in love out of the blue.
And you remember the other hexenbiest who came into the shop after Juliette went into her coma?
She gave Rosalee a list of ingredients for, like, a purification process that was really similar to the ingredients that Adalind used with her cat.
What if there's a connection between the purification potion, the hexenbiest who asked for it, and what happened with Juliette and the Captain and their obsessive-compulsive hellhole?
And if there is a connection, we might be able to find it in the list of ingredients that the hexenbiest gave Rosalee.
I just think we should get down to the shop and see if we can't stop this before really it spins, like, totally out of control.
- I can't.
- Me neither.
You want this to end, you're gonna have to try harder than that.
I don't want it to stop.
This is insane.
How do I even know what I'm looking for?
It's got the hexenbiest's phone number on it.
Oh, that's Catherine Schade.
Well, it's just that it had a secret kicker.
If Juliette woke up, she and the guy who kissed her would have these insanely intense feelings for one another, and all hell would break loose.
It makes perfect sense.
- She's dead.
This'll help.
Just really happy to know you had nothing to do with what I'm seeing.
- Where are you?
We responded to a call of shots fired.
No blood, no weapon.
So you're coming here, right?
What are you doing?
Where is she?
You okay?
You want to talk about this?
Nick, I really don't understand why any of this is happening.
- You're hurt.
How do you want to handle this?
We don't have a weapon, and there's no one to file charges against.
If anything happens to me... yeah, I know, I'll be hearing from your lawyer.
Get in.
Did you get the key?
Was it Captain Renard?
She tried to shoot him?
Where's the trailer?
I'm not showing you anything until you fix what's wrong with me.
I can't fix you.
Somebody took those powers away from me.
Well, you better come up with something because I'm losing my sense of humor.
How?
That's no good for anybody.
You're just gonna have to trust me.
Hasn't worked out so well in the past.
Quit living in the past.
I want what you would never show to her.
Now we're talking.
The flowers are too much, aren't they?
Maybe you should give them to her.
And I brought you some, uh... oh, they're beautiful.
And Nick's here.
I think I know what the problem is.
Have you given any thought to what happens to me if my brother gets the key?
Have you thought about what might happen to me if he doesn't?
There's still time to choose sides, you know.
But I wouldn't count on my brother for any such consideration.
Make yourself at home.
If that hexenbiest who came into the shop was Adalind's mother, and she told your mom there was a royal here in Portland, then he must have been the one she made the purification process for.
Ergo and hence, your Captain is the royal here in Portland.
Okay, what am I looking for?
Anything with these ingredients.
'Cause it involves getting Juliette and your Captain to take it together.
It says we need the instrument of original infection.
Okay, the instrument of original infection would've been the cat's claws.
So what do we do now?
I've had all the rest I want.
Yeah, that's one of the bigger mistakes I've made in a while.
He seems to think she had something to do with what happened to you.
So if she has any problems with you, you make sure to watch your back.
I'll be looking in all directions, Captain.
It's the purification process, the same one on the list Adalind's mom brought in.
This is gonna help Juliette remember me?
You're just gonna have to survive that.
Do not let the Captain leave.
The Captain took something that belongs to me.
There's, uh, nothing to clear.
Hank, I try not to get involved in a cop's personal life.
So excuse me.
Well, I wouldn't even bring it up if I wasn't trying to protect Adalind...
And you're only telling me this now?
Did you get it?
Well, maybe you need some help.
What I need is more time.
Your brother's very impatient.
There's a car waiting for me downstairs right now.
I'll be sure to tell him that you tried so awfully hard.
Unfortunately for you, he won't give a damn.
You just missed him.
I tried to stop him, but he definitely wanted to get the hell out of here.
Not now.
How is he involved, Nick?
- This is between me and him.
- Nick... stay out of it.
You need to find Adalind.
Name it.
This is an interesting choice.
There's a reason for that.
You...
Ever since your aunt came to see you.
You tried to kill her.
It was never about her.
It's why I called you here.
There's a reason I asked you to come here.
If Adalind gets that key, we're both dead.
It's a lot bigger than you and me.
- Believe me, nobody wants this thing between Juliette to end more than I do.
Yeah, well, I guess you're gonna have to prove that.
Yeah, well, if I knew how, I would.
I know how.
Now what?
That was it?
- That's it.
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...
- Deal.
There's a whole world full of people that don't know who or what we are.
What if they see the girl turning into a wolf, for example?
Now you can find your son.
I'm at the town line.
Two people down, maybe three.
Hey, beautiful.
Here, I didn't think you'd notice. Aah!
I think your ribs are broken.
Oh, that must be why it hurts when I laugh.
Did you see his face?
His one true love, gone in an instant!
- But you took her first. - Aah!
You can't do that!
I can if you let me go.
What would Belle want you to do?
Over here!
Do you know this guy?
I've never seen him before.
That's because he drove into town.
From the outside?
Anybody seen the doctor?
Thank you, Gerhardt.
And let's have a better look at that medal.
My son.
Your mother gave me that when we were married.
A commission.
Father, surely you're joking.
My work is far too important to leave now.
I purchased you a commission.
You will join the Mobile 34th as their camp physician.
It's an honor.
Well, yes, of course, but I'm not sure you realize the important scientific work he's doing.
Certainly, but how will he do his work without my financial support?
Papa, I rely on that money.
I've already allowed you the use of our summer home for your foolish purposes.
Isn't that enough?
I have made great progress!
The name Frankenstein is going to stand for life!
She's in good hands here.
I promise.
Victor, wait.
Again?
You're really into this, aren't you?
Damn, that hurts.
Told you.
You cracked a few ribs.
Where's Cora?
Let's talk about something I am interested in... my hook.
May I have it back?
Or is there another attachment you'd prefer?
You're awfully chipper for a guy who just failed to kill his enemy, then got hit by a car.
Well, my ribs may be broken, but... everything else is still intact, which is more than can be said for other bad days I've had.
Plus I did some quality damage to my foe.
You hurt Belle.
I hurt his heart.
Belle's just where he keeps it.
He killed my love.
I know the feeling.
Keep smilin', buddy.
- 10,000.
- 10,000.
His name is Greg Mendell.
Now let's see... pictures of him alone at a bunch of Eastern seaboard tourist locations... a LinkedIn account... and he tweets pictures of his food.
- It's gone.
- Anyone could drive in.
Why are my instincts telling me that's a bad thing?
'Cause you've seen "E.T." or "Splash" or any other movie where they find something magical and study it to death.
Hook says he doesn't know where Cora is, and God knows what she's gonna do.
With other people coming here, that's not gonna be good for anyone.
We need to find Regina, tell her we know she was framed.
He's bleeding into his chest cavity.
It's not a full flood, you know, but pretty soon he'll be drowning in his own blood.
Gold.
I owe you nothing, Whale.
I owe none of you anything, and some of you owe me.
So, yeah, just... no.
So instead of trying to get him out of here, you better be hoping he dies, because if he doesn't, he's gonna be driving tour buses up and down main street.
So glad I don't give a damn.
Look... letting him die is easy.
I can do that, if that's what you decide.
Let's take this somewhere private.
It's not really murder if we let him succumb to his injuries.
I'm pretty sure it is.
If we save him and kill the whole town, is that really better?
So we have to choose between our lives and his.
I know, but let's worry about Storybrooke after we save a life.
Dr. Whale, prep for surgery.
Anyone else notice he's drunk off his ass?
Someone's looking for Greg.
How long before they come here?
Good evening, doctor.
Stiltskin.
Rumple Von Stiltskin.
A foreigner.
What tipped you off?
My rosy complexion?
Yes, I've seen nothing of your drab little land yet, but I am interested in your work.
And I can't bring back dead loved ones, anyway, if that's what you're after.
I think my deceased are best kept where they are, dearie, thank you very much.
You see, where I come from, we do things... differently.
Your land has witchcraft, but it's feeble, neglected stuff.
How did you do that?
Well, I've been called worse.
There is a cost to you... knowledge.
That is the deal.
Then it's a deal.
Bring back the equipment.
We're staying, and we're going to need a body.
Hello, Rumple.
Well, I expected this was just a matter of time.
Had hoped you were dead, but hey... disappointment's just part of life.
Aw, the crocodile snaps at the little bird.
And after I brought you a gift.
And what do you want for this, uh... this "peace offering"?
My daughter.
You were so clever to get her to lay the curse so you could come here.
You don't need her anymore.
Let me try to get her back and let us live.
You know what that is, of course.
It'll find him... if this one truly is it.
I want you... to find the one person in this universe who might still love you.
After all, I'm doing the same thing.
Do you have any spells to return memories?
I only know what you taught me... master.
So will you accept my offer of a truce?
Truce.
I get the best watches this way.
Okay, just... let's save this guy, all right?
Right.
Of course not.
Gerhardt.
I thought you worked with cells in Petri dishes.
My work has progressed.
And I thought you supported me.
Gerhardt?
Same person again.
We could answer it, just let her know he's okay.
He's not okay.
That settles that.
Ohh, my nerves can't take this.
- Then page him.
He was not looking so good earlier.
He's here.
No, but his pager is.
He's gone.
Maybe doc can do it.
Surgery?
Like some kind of Frankenstein?
What went on here while we were gone?
Ruby, get going.
We're gonna send this guy back home with bolts in his neck.
She'll find him.
Yeah, but what kind of state is he gonna be in?
I will bring you back, my brother, I promise.
It's burned... like coal.
Of course, doctor.
Explain yourself.
Gerhardt?
My boy.
My dear son.
The things you do...
You cut into your brother!
It can work!
I did this for you, too, father.
I wanted you to have two sons again.
And now I have none.
Mom?
You in there?
Can I come in?
Mom?
I missed you so much when...
I always knew.
I was framed.
You knew?
How did you know?
Simple.
Did it work?
Could you get out of my light, please?
You know, where I come from, there are hearts that can withstand anything because of magic.
I'm gonna bring you a friend, a master of the hat.
He shall take you to a young woman who has exactly what you need.
You put on a little show for her, and then you walk away with all your prayers answered.
A heart for your brother.
And who is this woman?
Her name... is Regina.
How did you get through?
Determination.
I had to see you.
I needed to tell you that I know why you sent me through the looking glass.
And I know why you tried to have me killed.
And it's... it's all right.
I think it's not all right.
I love you.
And I never should have made you marry the king.
I'm so sorry.
When you cried over my coffin, it... it all changed.
You framed me for the cricket.
Temporarily, so you could see what these people really think of you.
I didn't want you to reject me.
Not again.
You wanted me broken.
Receptive.
You owe me that.
And then you'll let us start over?
I don't see that happening, mother.
And I deserve the same thing from you.
You're right.
Rumplestiltskin was right.
The new heart worked.
Welcome back, brother.
Victor... if you have really given me this...
We've kept him waiting long enough.
He's still recovering.
It's a slow process, so don't expect him to...
You did it.
I did it.
It's really you.
I believed you.
The terrible thing is, for a moment, I believed you did it.
He's a monster!
What a fool I was!
That's not my son!
- You are not my son.
- You're a ghoul and a grave robber.
A fool and a witch doctor.
You have killed our father.
I guess they're right about that.
Rumplestiltskin says that magic has a price, but from where I'm sitting, seems that science does, too.
I ate my boyfriend.
But... we can't let it stop us.
She gave us a chance to start over, and I wanna take it.
I think you should, too.
But he never got over our mother.
If I could've just brought her back...
Maybe a wife, a mother.
Maybe there's still some stuff you can fix.
Nervous?
Not about owning up to what I've done.
It's just... these carriages are strange.
When were you in my house?
I haven't had the pleasure.
That was in my house.
Well, let's be honest.
Taking me to be pilloried by the town might gain you some points, but as long as Emma and her parents are here, he's not really yours.
Not like he was when he made things for his one and only mommy.
You've been too bad for too long, and now they see you as a... a snake.
My son back.
And I want my daughter back.
I meant everything I said earlier.
I can do better.
I won't push you away again.
Let me into your heart.
Together, we can get him back again.
How?
Oh, I have a few thoughts.
I was just stretching my legs.
Now I'm gonna go do this thing.
I was trying to bring you back.
Are you here?
Yes, it's me.
No.
I won't do it.
I will still save you.
Father is wrong.
I will find a way.
Where are they?
You did it?
- I wanna talk to him.
We're not talking to him as a group.
We're not a group-sheriff.
That's probably true.
We'll be right here, then.
I know you don't remember, but just... indulge me.
Please.
Be careful with it.
It's your talisman.
It's a cup.
It's magic.
Okay, just go away.
Just go... just go away.
I'm sorry.
Nurse?
Sheriff Swann, actually.
Oh, thank God.
But I do need you to state what happened in your own words... what you did, what you saw.
I just think I might be able to put your mind at ease.
There might be... an explanation if you saw...
It's okay.
I'm just glad that you... were honest with me.
So when... when can I head home?
As soon as the doctor clears you.
We don't wanna keep you.
Oh, good.
Now maybe things can calm down for ten minutes and we can catch our breath.
Granny wouldn't tell me anything.
The monster had the bolts, not the doctor.
Frankenstein isn't in here.
It's not even a fairy tale.
I'm cashing it in.
It's not... a good...
You do honor your agreements, don't you?
I need to find someone, so we're leaving today.
Well, where?
Oh, and, um, we have a long history, so know this and know it to be true.
I'll see you at noon.
I'm seeing how the indoor temperature suits them.
Our six weeks together are very nearly up, Watson.
Finally the space will serve a purpose.
Oh, you say the nicest things.
Sounds ominous.
No, we just need to carve out a time to talk.
Most of what we humans have to say to one another is communicated haptically.
When I think of the many thousands of words that you yourself have wasted during your time here...
We'll go to dinner, we'll talk-- verbally, haptically, whatever.
I think the whole point is to reflect on your progress.
Well, I am working on a final assessment, but that is for your father.
Right, 'cause he's the one paying your exorbitant fees.
Actually, my fees are the opposite of exorbitant.
He'll probably put it on his fridge with his many colorful magnets.
Captain Gregson, how may I be of assistance?
The owner of the house is a CPA by the name of Ian Vickers.
We're pretty sure he's also the victim.
And by "pretty sure," you mean...
Vickers' secretary dropped off some files, and found the place like this.
Hard to like his chances, given all this.
So, aside from the blood, the scene is clean.
No footprints, no witnesses, no nothing.
Whoever did this-- we don't know the first thing about him.
He's tall.
I beg your pardon?
Hook's gone now, but it was at one point attached to a tripod device of the killer's own design.
He assembled it after he incapacitated Vickers, then hung him upside down, slit his throat.
There are two more groove marks inside the perimeter of the blood-- there and there.
After he'd completely drained Vickers, he dismantled the device, taking it and the exsanguinated corpse of his victim with him.
I didn't deduce anything, actually.
I've stalked this particular madman before.
In London.
His image has never been captured.
And he also has no type or victim profile, which makes it almost impossible to predict when, where, or whom he might strike.
He drains his victims of his or her blood, then dumps their bodies in the ocean.
Bodies of 21 of his victims were recovered when they washed up on the coastline.
The other 16 were, presumably, carried out to sea.
I'm gonna call the Coast Guard, tell them to keep an eye out?
All 12 pints of it.
M's fascination with blood is as mysterious as the man himself.
He mentions it in his, uh, correspondence with the police but only rarely.
His letters are, in my humble estimation, a feint, an attempt to make the authorities, or anyone who would attempt to analyze him, believe that he is one thing, when he is, in fact, another.
Finally, M tends to kill in bunches, so the whole NYPD should be prepared for more bodies to drop.
I've brought my own personal files on M to the station, and I'm arranging them for your consumption.
I do?
Well, I was struck, I suppose.
By the time he had claimed his 36th life, however, my addiction was out of control.
I was, I'm quite embarrassed to say, useless to the police.
Now, his appearance here in the States-- it's a second chance for me.
It's an opportunity to do what I should have done a long time ago-- bring a ruthless killer to justice.
Oh, he may have referenced me in a letter or two.
Really?
Hey, just a reminder that I have an appointment in a little while, but I will be back in a couple of hours.
I shall count the seconds until your return.
Much as it pains me to admit it, you have become something of a crutch.
I need to get used to working by myself again.
Are you sure?
So, it's been a while since I've been here.
It's been really busy.
With?
I'm your therapist, Joan.
My confidentiality protects your confidentiality.
How does he feel about you leaving?
I know how invigorating you've found his work.
You went from being a surgeon to an addiction counselor.
There's no reason you couldn't make another change, pursue work of a more investigative nature.
I like what I do right now.
Well, there's the rub, I'm afraid.
Thanks, baby.
Before I go, you want another go?
Do you mind, love?
Thanks again, baby.
Thus narrowing M's dump site to the entire east side of Manhattan.
My money's on the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Oil in the hair.
I donated to the cleanup effort a couple years ago.
I'm gonna miss this.
Well, maybe not this, but... this.
Working with you.
I think what you do is amazing.
I wanted to tell you that at our "wrap-up dinner", but it seems less and less likely that's gonna happen.
Anyway, I'm gonna wait outside-- just give me a five-minute warning, and I'll call a cab.
So, given that it's after 11:00, our delivery options are a little more limited.
There is that Vietnamese place on 23rd, but I think you said it was a front for songbird smuggling.
Watson, I need you to be very, very quiet right now.
Why?
Because I believe our home has just become a crime scene.
"Men make plans, God laughs.
"I am laughing at you now, as I always have.
The lock on the rear door was picked.
Quite expertly, I might add.
I guess this answers the question about whether he came to New York for you, huh?
My sincerest apologies, Captain.
If I'd have had any notion that my presence here would have drawn him to your city...
Look, if he wanted me dead, he would have lain in wait, not left some bombastic note.
But I assure you, I am safe as houses here.
I guess that leaves you, Miss Watson.
I'm staying.
I go where he goes, remember?
Thank you very much.
Good night.
I'm heading to bed.
What's all that?
Since our humble home was penetrated so easily by a madman.
But you told Captain Gregson you weren't worried.
I'm not.
I'm just thinking ahead.
My enemies are legion.
The next one might leave more than just a note.
So much for the giant apiary in my bedroom.
Yo, man, I got these knockoff Gucci shades-- 20 bucks, and they're yours.
I got more of an American feel for you.
Come on, man, could you just check it out for me, please?
Yo, dawg, you just broke my phone.
He was making his way up to your stoop.
Say the word, and we'll send him on his way.
It's okay, he can stay.
Thank you.
So, how do you know Sherlock?
A while back, me and a buddy were scamming on Washington Square Park.
I'd chat the folks up, Levon'd steal their wallets.
No one made us except for Holmes.
Now he just uses us sometimes.
What do you mean he uses you?
Little earlier he came up to me and a few of my boys and told us to check out a few hotels, look for this guy.
Said he had a few hundred for whoever could find him.
And I found him-- so I'm here to collect.
If this is who I think it is, he's dangerous.
You shouldn't have been near him.
Yeah, Holmes warned us about sticking to the public places.
I followed him, even got him to talk to me, so I could be sure it was him.
He's a Brit, just like Holmes said.
Care to explain this?
That's funny, when I moved in here, you didn't mention anything about your little, uh... surveillance system.
Did you honestly believe there wouldn't be security measures?
Is that M?
Vintage MG driving gloves-- quite expensive.
He's also a recent émigré to New York.
Why did I assume that he would be in a hotel as opposed to a property he might own?
Well, it's quite simple.
I noted a curious scent on the note that he left.
I quickly realized it was, in fact, a combination of scents.
Those of the high-end hand soap and an even higher-end mint-based shampoo.
Each product is used by various upscale hotels around the city, but only one chain, the Betancourt, stocks both.
My lieutenants and I each took a Betancourt, and watched for M.
That's all very impressive, but I want to know why you shared a photo of a wanted serial killer with a bunch of kids instead of going to the NYPD.
Several weeks ago, you learned of the existence of a woman named Irene Adler.
I told you she'd died.
M killed her.
Obviously, he realized the degree to which I was assisting the British police in their hunt to find him.
He zeroed in on me, made things personal.
What do you mean you plan to torture and murder M?
Hard to imagine I could have been much clearer, Watson.
Wait, how are you so calm?
We'd been together seven months by then.
I won't bore you with the details of our courtship.
Irene was different.
You were in love.
Prior to her murder, my drug use had been... recreational.
Something to do when I was bored or in need of a boost during a particularly challenging investigation.
After Irene, well, I lost control.
I used... various stimulants as I tried to help the authorities identify M.
I'm not gonna let you risk it all by chasing down a psychopath.
You know, I don't think you understand, Watson.
Without you, none of this would have been possible.
Everything that you've helped me do these past six weeks-- every-every meeting you've dragged me to, every exercise you've compelled me to perform-- it's all been in preparation for this moment.
I am as clearheaded and as focused as I have ever been.
There's a clarity to my thinking that's... frightening.
I didn't help you stay sober so you could become a murderer.
Well, you didn't realize that's what you were doing.
Nor did I.
Is that why you didn't want me to help you with the M files the other day?
I'd hoped we would never have to have this conversation.
I don't want you feeling responsible for something that I have to do.
You lied to me because you know what you're planning to do is wrong.
But you know that I'm gonna have to call Captain Gregson.
You do as you feel you must, Watson.
She said you had something for me.
That depends.
Now, tell me everything you saw today.
What is it?
Where the heck did you get that?
Son of a bitch.
I've lost friends on the job to scumbags.
Believe me, there's been more than a few times I thought about taking things into my own hands.
But I didn't.
Now, he may not be a cop, but he's been around law enforcement long enough to know that.
Sherlock deduced that it was, uh, the Betancourt chain.
I'm gonna have my guys go to all the Betancourt hotels, see if we can't scoop him up.
I don't think M is the only one we need to be looking for.
If he isn't at his hotel, Sherlock may already have him.
You.
Me.
I hope you don't mind being hung right-side up-- I know you prefer the opposite for your victims.
You figured out where you're gonna start yet?
I have not.
I had hoped to use the... bees in some fashion, but then it occurred to me you might be allergic.
After all this trouble, I'd hate for our fun to be over too soon.
That would be a pity.
Bit surprised at you, though.
I thought you as more of a by-the-book kind of bloke.
So, why here, huh?
Why not take me straight to the nick?
Irene.
Pretending the name isn't familiar to you will not make things any easier for you.
Addison?
Adler.
Irene Adler.
Sorry to disappoint you, mate, but it wasn't me.
No, of course it wasn't.
It was probably the other blood-draining madman with the tripod device, hmm?
Not for the killing, of course.
I had a misunderstanding with a Man United fan.
He was running around slagging off the Arsenal.
And while I was doing the stretch, read in the papers that the notorious "M" had struck again.
Imagine my surprise.
But you disappoint me.
And Scotland Yard, of course.
Falling for that copycat so easily?
Well, why would you when facing an agonizing death?
Ex-Royal Marine.
Death's an old friend.
Is he?
What about torture?
Is he an old friend, too?
You made me a shambles of a man.
Now I'm simply returning the favor.
That's when I saw the second man's feet.
He walked right by me.
He said he would cut me free.
I think he was British.
I think the first man was British, too.
He was watching a British soccer game... on my TV.
Do you remember any other details about either man?
Powder.
I think I know where Sherlock went.
Well, what makes you think that would be the place?
Do you have an address?
No.
I think I know how we can find one.
Anybody ever tell you you punch like a woman?
Yeah, a woman did once.
But she was much bigger than me.
And the abductor of young girls that she used to turn a profit in the sex trade, so...
Well, for a ponce, you move pretty quick.
What, I dropped my first body here, what, 72 hours ago?
What'd you do, jump on a plane?
What makes you think I'd gone back there?
What are you talking about, "gone back"?
You trying to tell me you live here now?
You know I live here.
You were in my home the other night.
That was your place?
Something's not right.
I already told you you're a terrible liar, didn't I?
I'm not lying.
He sold me out.
He never told me you was here.
Who didn't?
My employer.
What was his motive for killing 37 people?
I don't know.
I never met him.
He sends me coded message on my cell phone.
It's there in my jacket.
Have a look if you don't believe me.
Gobbledygook.
Proves nothing.
Sebastian Moran-- that's my real name.
Look it up!
The fight I was in-- there was a trial, it was in the papers.
He always talked about you.
He never told me you was here, and he sure as hell never told me that was your apartment I broke into.
That was Moriarty.
Just heard from the Buildings Department, and they said that Holmes' dad's company applied for a remodeling permit about six months ago on a loft in Brooklyn.
The address is 3203 North Sixth Street.
Tell ESU to meet me there.
Moriarty's who you want, not me.
I seem to recall you saying you were not afraid to die.
It's not fear I'm feeling right now.
Righteous anger.
Moriarty sold me out, and I'm gonna get even.
You're a monster.
All of those... but I'm not a liar.
Reach out to Brixton Prison, they'll tell you that I was locked up when Irene was killed.
No.
I couldn't have been in two places at once.
Look at me, Holmes.
You killed her.
Moriarty said you was obsessed with puzzles.
But he's greatest puzzle you'll ever come across.
You kill me now, and you'll be killing the best clue you ever had.
I knew you'd make the right decision.
You're a rare thing in this world, Holmes.
You're an honorable man.
A famous statistician once stated that while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty.
I am not an average man.
Stay here.
Yeah.
Are you kidding me?
For the last time, mate, Holmes did not abduct me.
I lured him to Miss Cullen's place, and then he followed me to that loft.
A loft just happened to be owned by his father?
Yeah, I was aware of that.
I just thought it'd be pretty cool if they found Holmes' body at his father's property.
Can you explain your injuries one more time?
I went at him.
He defended himself.
It's as simple as that.
He stabbed you.
Eventually, yeah.
Miracle, really.
He missed every major organ, according to the doc that looked me over in the cell.
Lucky.
What can I say?
I've led a charmed life.
You're missing out on quite a story back there.
Looks more like he was stationary.
If that's what you meant to do, I'm impressed.
If you're trying to make some sort of point...
He presumed to know me and he needed to be shown that he did not.
He says he's willing to confess to all the murders, but he won't give you up.
He believes that he's been wronged.
He thinks I'm the best chance he has at bringing whoever wronged him to justice.
Are you planning on helping him?
As it turns out, he did not.
He was incarcerated at the time she died.
I confirmed it a short while ago.
I'm sorry that I lied to you, Watson.
The last few days have been quite... vexing.
Even now, I'm not certain if I've done the right thing in allowing M to live.
It's strange, really.
I'm rarely conflicted about the decisions I make.
That's the beauty of deductive reasoning, I suppose.
It makes a science of almost everything.
Not this.
I'm gonna miss this.
Maybe not this so much.
I think what you do is amazing.
I'm sorry our last days together had to go so poorly.
Hi, this is Joan Watson calling from New York.
Is Mr. Holmes available?
Okay.
Watson, what is it?
Um, I called your father last night.
Yeah, Mom, you promised!
Homer, I told you, don't call me "Mom."
For maximum safety, all children must wear anti-kidnapping bracelets.
Is this a kid you'd pay ransom for?
Dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?
Keep an eye on the kids, Homer.
Can I keep an eye on that kid?
He's fabulous.
Bart and Lisa.
Holy moley.
Oh, it's hopeless!
What's hopeless?
Who the hell are you?
Duck walk.
I made it, kids!
I am king of Learnington Castle!
We tricked you.
Eat Nerf, Homeboy!
Real... mature...!
Is these mice pillows here for the taking?
I hate working here.
At least at Krustyburger, you could burn yourself and go home.
Unauthorized child departure.
Lockdown mode initiated.
Another stupid kid got out.
I can't tell the manager.
These lasers are nothing more than colored lights!
Until then, why don't we bond by sharing our childbirth experiences.
The nurses were so great.
My husband held my hand the whole time.
Bet you the dads are doing the same thing.
Don't forget your jacket, sweetie.
Get out of there, you!
Freedom!
What the hell was that?
You've been through a traumatic experience.
Are you sure you want to go to work today?
I hate to be a nag, but this is my real head.
I guess, despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around every corner, like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show.
My friend, you just experienced W.R.O.L. firsthand.
What's W.R.O.L.?
It means "Without the Rule of Law."
Ah, take a look at this.
The modern world-- an inexorable march of progress.
Sweet.
Or is it?
We're slaves to the system.
Close the supermarket, and we starve.
Cut off the tap, we drink our cat's blood.
Who will survive in this new world?
The man who is prepared.
Oh, my God!
This unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!
And I'm the guy you want to know when the stuff hits the fan.
Hey, man, no need to almost swear.
Come with me.
Homer, meet the Springfield Preppers.
Always partying on deck with your Docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge!
It's based on nothing.
That's super.
Now, Homer, what would you do in the case of an E.M.P.?
Electromagnetic pulse.
A burst of radiation that knocks out every electrical system in the country.
I'd slash my wrists.
We won't have room for all the unprepared.
Honey, everything's fine.
There's nothing to worry about.
When grown-ups say that, it means there is something to worry about.
Just go play your saxophone.
While you can.
What does that mean?
Just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of.
Smell some bread!
When things go south, the sheeple will clean out every supermarket in town.
Typical sheeple.
Uh... are you eating my grain?
Maybe.
That was a five-pound bag!
Yeah, but I'll go home, weigh myself, and I'll have gained six pounds.
I guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.
What's up?
Going crazy again?
I wish.
Son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies.
So, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?
Guys who call themselves Preacher or Deacon are very bad.
Hollywood has taught you well, my son.
Now let's push play.
Now the Ice Bishop of Beverly Hills will teach you the true meaning of cold!
I have come from a place where the land is warm, and the only ice is made by machines called... fridge-ra-torrs.
Aren't they just saying "refrigerator"?
Do not question the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.
Here it is, Homer.
Homer, we all know America's collapse is about three months away.
Six weeks at most.
There's always one alarmist.
Well, that is a big part of it.
Um... a lot of that stuff must've got lost in the move.
What's going on?
You can't have secrets from your wife!
It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
I've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall.
I thought the basement looked cleaner.
Survive what?
The looming kablooey.
I'm going to bed.
There's no handle on this side!
The one thing I couldn't prepare for.
I will eat anything orange except an orange.
Everyone but us is doomed.
I am so jazzed.
Mr. Mayor, what's your administration doing to ensure there's no panic?
Marge, this is it, TEOTWAWKI!
"The end of the world as we know it"?
Lisa and Maggie are downstairs, and Bart's in his room with Milhouse.
Boy, get in the car, and say good-bye to your best friend forever.
Bye forever, Milhouse.
She brings the gift of music to the new world.
This is gonna be a long apocalypse.
Ay, caramba indeed.
Dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here?
Society will not have to start from square one.
Homie, I never thought we'd turn our backs
Marge, when I started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me.
How can you call yourself a Christian?
If Jesus had a gun, he'd be alive today.
Homer Simpson!
When I fell in love with you, it was because of your big heart and your good looks.
Soon we'll be approached by people who haven't prepared.
Now, do not look at their faces.
I may have solved that problem.
This rifle scope I modified makes any human face look dangerous and threatening.
Are you that good with a knife?
Oh, God, now what?
Every time you wake us up early in the morning, it's either church or we have to change our identities.
Don't be silly, Mary Ellen.
Now we're going to leave this place.
White ricer brown?
I never noticed.
Good boy.
So we'll take these supplies back to Springfield where they're needed most.
You're a good man, Homer Simpson.
You said you cut the wires to the alarm.
Hmm, I cut the wires to something.
Okay everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked "23" or "36" or something.
If we miss it, we're dead.
Dad, there are lights following us.
How can that be?
I took every last can of gas.
Now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall.
Out of our way, corn!
The starving people of Springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes and flash frozen corn niblets!
Dad, you said people would be drinking each other's blood.
You got to watch a VHS copy of Red Dawn 13 times!
Stop complaining!
What happened with the E.M.P.?
Only Springfield lost power, you see, and after a few days, it came back.
Then society didn't crumble?
The zoo animals weren't eaten?
No-- well, a couple.
This non-disaster is a catastrophe!
Are you really so disappointed the world didn't end, just so you could be proven right?
Yeah, but what you didn't know was I was gonna poison all your drinking water.
Which is why I'm only drinking my own urine.
Guys, can't you see that even an imperfect society is better than the savagery of creating a new one?
I for one am glad we're stuck with civilization, and I think we will be for a long, long time.
I'm hungry.
Look, you can have potato chips now, or if you wait ten minutes, you can have all the brains you can eat.
So we're gonna change that one.
Okay, let me see, let me see, let me see!
You guys are want to, um...
All clear.
We make an amazing team.
I call my method "the Trojan horse."
It's from Carrarra, Italy.
Keeping in mind, that space is only 12% of 1,462 square feet.
Well, just go get the broom.
What is happening?
It's gonna cost more if you want me to eat it now.
That's when it hit me-- my daughters know nothing about home care and maintenance.
By the time he's old enough to call, it will be "numero uno."
I felt like eating breakfast alfresco.
Jay, he's been eating outside on his own all week.
Do you think that he feels left out because of all the attention I give Joe?
Ay, that's so sweet.
You can take Joe to his baby class.
Gloria, I think he already knows how to be a baby.
I love you, but I can't laugh at that again.
Manny, how about I pick you up after school, and we both have a special day?
Well, I did talk to Jay about getting some tickets for this reading.
What reading?
I told you about it last night.
Sorry, buddy, but I already committed to spending the afternoon with Joe so you and your mom could have more time together.
Hey, maybe she can take you.
- Can we, mom?
Why do I feel that you did something shifty?
All right, sweetie, you have a good day.
Next!
Next loser!
Next!
If you say so.
Next!
Well, I'm really good, too.
You know, it's really appropriate that we're at a school, because I'm about to teach you a lesson.
Next!
No, thank you, mister.
Whatcha doin'?
I think I have an idea.
- A qualified buyer?
I'm sorry-- Did you just say 40-12 percent?
Mm, no, I didn't.
And here I thought we were working so well together, and you're just being manipulative.
Oh, how dare you accuse me of Trojan horsing you.
You have a name for it?
Then the little bugger turned on me.
I'm just kidding.
I drove him to his little class, but he dozed off right before we got there.
Or he took a page from the Jay Pritchett playbook-- saw the crap he was in for and pretended to be asleep.
Mr. Pritchett?
Claire's friend from High School, remember?
How could I forget?
You knocked down my mailbox with your K-car.
Again, I apologize.
I'm taking them to the James Bond movie, and they don't want me to sit with them.
I miss babies.
Oh, they're a lot of fun, huh?
Joe, I found a better way for us to bond...
James Bond.
My dad taught me everything there is to know about maintaining a home, and today, that tradition continues.
Hey, I have an idea-- let's lock him in.
What are we lookin' at, huh?
Photosynthesis?
What converts this conversation into over?
Girls, you need to learn these things.
You might find yourselves living alone at some point.
I long for the day.
Okay, we're just gonna start with something really basic, all right?
But if it happens to you, what do you do?
Where you guys from originally?
Found another light that's out.
Pam also happens to be a friend and a fellow gay parent at Lily's school.
Am I trying to stack the deck against Claire here?
Stupid thing!
Dad, we've been standing here forever.
I didn't need a torx screwdriver.
I've always wanted one, though.
Dad, help me.
Are we gonna do that thing again where you try on different outfits like in "Pretty woman"?
Sh-Shaq-a-hack?
- What's up?
I see you spent a lot more time on the court than you did in the classroom, so clearly, I've come to the right place.
Look, I need you to teach me everything you know.
How come it's so important?
Like there's any emotion in those eyes.
That's impossible.
Okay, that's a valid point.
It is a bit of an empty space out there.
Oh, well, you know, that happens to women of a certain age, like with my mom.
What are you, like, an angel sent from heaven?
If a family wants to come in here, and--and build themselves a fountain, they can do so themselves.
That's true.
Talent runs in the family.
Anyway, I'm just saying I think a family would respond to having a little drama in the backyard.
And so are you.
Please tell me you are not falling for this.
I'm not, but I am enjoying this little show tremendously, so thank you.
As for my professional opinion on the fountain, don't do it.
- Cam?
I can't believe I just went garter shopping with my son.
When you find a better way to keep my socks up, let me know.
Hey, as long as we're in the mall, you wanna stop in the baby class to see Jay and Joe?
It's not like mother and son, that the bond is naturally strong.
Hey, isn't that Joe over there?
No, that's some weird baby.
He's not perfect like my little Joe.
But he's got the same blanket.
The gas is on, dad.
I can see the spark from the igniter.
I don't know what it is.
Of course I need you.
You're the best when it comes to this.
Just push it back in and make that popping sound.
Hey, make sure you tell Claire how pretty she looks tonight.
Honey, that's a torque wrench, not a torx screwdriver.
Okay, you're just screaming now.
Yeah, plus the car is doing something funny, and there's a light on the dashboard that looks like a little genie lamp.
My kids are helpless, but maybe that's okay.
I don't know why your mom's so mad.
Maybe it has something to do with giving your son away to a complete stranger.
You're next.
It was sold out.
Maybe that's how you can make it up to her-- take me to the "Moby Dick" reading tomorrow.
Nice try.
Doing something selfless for her other son could make up for your monumental blunder.
How about we exchange the baby for a cheese pizza?
You were supposed to spend quality time with the baby.
It was the baby class!
Now you're just trying to dig yourself out of a hole because you know that you were caught in a lie.
Don't play that card.
But you.
You only do what's good for you.
Let me tell you something, Jay Pritchett-- when it comes to raising kids, you get what you give.
Well, you rattled that off pretty goodly.
You don't have to do this, daddy.
I know, but daddy really wants to do this, okay?
Hello, Milo.
Hello, one of Lily's dads.
All right, let's make this interesting, okay?
If I win, the new rule is this, okay?
Milo, the ball's over here.
Three bounces to the wall makes you a lo-ser, makes you a lo-ser
I'm sure you're both wondering why I summoned you here tonight.
I cannot believe that you went rogue.
You'll soon see why.
Prepare your senses... for dancing waters.
I've even stocked the pools with fish of gold.
They're just goldfish, but they're-- they're right here.
What did you spend?
Quite a bit, actually, but I don't wanna get into that.
Let me turn this up to eleventy-five.
Hey, Cam, are fish of gold supposed to swim backwards like that?
No, not to my knowledge, no.
Yeah, it's kind of like they're all-- they're gathering towards that thing.
I don't really understand how...
Okay, now do it again.
You're never off the court!
Then let me end up with mine.
And you are an amazing woman.
I've been doing a lot of thinking, and now I know what I dream of.
He tried to stop me.
I would never do that.
You're fine.
Her cousin told me this is where she is staying.
Well... here's my card.
If you should happen to see this woman... who doesn't live here... tell her Oscar is in town and really needs to talk to her.
My husband.
I finished the dishes.
Thank you.
What on earth would we have to talk about?
Coroner contends it was all a big mix-up.
Yeah, well, while you look, how about letting my client out on bail?
And my client wasn't the father.
Recognize those e-mails, Eddie?
Keep your mouth shut.
Oh, crap.
Damn it, Rosie!
How much wax did you put on this floor?
Aren't you going to kiss your son good-bye?
- In front of the baby?
- He won't talk, huh?
Even if I do, you made a vow to your wife.
Eddie proposed to Flora two weeks before she was killed.
He never told me they were that serious.
You know how I've been telling you they don't have enough to convict your son of first degree murder?
He wanted a traditional Latin wife... someone who would cook for him and clean... and have a house full of babies.
But the babies never came.
My life was so... empty.
The only thing that gave me any kind of joy was my singing.
I told Oscar I wanted to try for a career as a professional.
So you left him?
Oscar Valdez doesn't fail.
But now he's found me.
God, I don't know what to do.
You got to talk to him.
If it's over, say it to his face.
There are some problems you cannot run away from.
Do you know they have an open relationship?
And if that means changing the rules of our relationship, then I'm willing to consider it.
And I know I'm laying a lot on ya, so take as much time as you need to consi...
I'm in.
You told him we were free Thursday night?
Immediately.
So I walk into this club the other night and who do I see?
My first boyfriend in high school.
Celia, hold on.
Could you do me a favor?
Would you mind looking for it?
Next thing you know, he takes me back to his place, and it is so on.
You know, I have to play this just right because this guy's absolutely marriage material.
Uh... but I think I heard the dryer.
I read the e-mails.
I was embarrassed.
You can't afford to be embarrassed.
I don't understand how you could propose.
Every time I mess up, you get to swoop in and fix my life?
All I've ever done is try to protect you.
- I can take care of myself!
Hey... what's going on?
Last night, Spence told me... he was willing to have an open marriage.
You're kidding.
That dweeb is so desperate to hang on to me, he's willing to let me step out once in a while.
I've never seen you be stupid before.
- How am I stupid?
- Is Spence a man?
I have work to do.
I'm a housekeeper, not a babysitter.
Well, since you asked, would you mind putting a little bit of sunblock on my shoulders?
Thank you.
So, you've been working here a while.
Is Remi seeing anyone?
Actually, Remi has several girlfriends.
One more thing.
Would you mind doing my toes?
You're kidding.
Oh, I know it's a lot to ask, but...
No, you can paint your own toes.
See, the thing is, I'm not.
You know, I heard Remi tell you to be nice to me.
Now maybe he doesn't realize you're obsessed with him.
Unless, of course, you do what I ask.
What do you think of this one?
I think that would look nice on Mr. Powell.
This is a birthday gift for our son.
I didn't know you and Mr. Powell had a son.
Barrett would have been 21 tomorrow.
Mrs. Powell, I'm confused.
Well... yes.
And then we blow out his candles, and we don't speak of him again until his next birthday.
I think he would have liked the cashmere.
Come in.
He did?
Really?
You must know what I'm about to ask you.
I'm sure you've overheard some phone calls.
Maybe Spence has had a lady friend over for a visit?
But you're not positive.
Do you suspect he might be interested in someone?
I'm sorry.
You mean like you betrayed him?
Thank you.
You changed your hair.
Do you like it?
You should invite me in.
Not as often as I'd like.
I think he makes poor choices.
Sometimes I wonder whether Barrett would have liked me.
I have no doubt... that your son would have loved you deeply.
So... how is everyone back home?
But there's nothing definite.
Well, it takes time.
I keep thinking about all the girls who come to this town, thinking they got talent, hoping someone will make them a star.
Then one day they wake up and they realize they have wasted the best years of their lives.
I don't want you to be one of those girls, Carmen.
I want you to come back home.
I actually spoke to the owner of Cantina Rosada, and he's looking for a girl singer on weekends.
He's willing to give you a try.
Just come back.
I'll find a way to make you happy.
That guy who opened the door the other day...
He has nothing to do with this.
I understand you more than you think.
There are so many bad men in this world.
Maybe you should be a little nicer to the good ones.
I gotta find that damn bird first.
I thought I saw her out here.
Anything else?
I wanted to thank you for... well, you know.
You should be thanking Odessa.
I saw the way you fought for me, Sam.
He was hurting you.
I can't allow that.
My whole life I've had to fight for everything I've ever wanted.
I never felt like anyone was on my side.
No.
Would you like a friend?
Yes.
Thank you.
I walked in on Mrs. Peri and her co-star over a month ago.
Why did you finally decide to tell me?
So... you know the name of a good divorce lawyer?
I want the world to know how I feel about you.
If you leave her for your maid, would people think you're much better?
If you love your son as much as I love mine, you can't risk losing him.
It's my job to teach my son how to be a man.
How can I do that when I'm constantly being humiliated?
I need a reason to get up in the morning, Rosie.
I need to know there's some moment of happiness waiting for me.
Hey, she pushed me first.
And if I wanted her dead, she'd be dead!
Why are you acting this way?
Since when do you care who I date?
I know you like me, and I like you, too.
I'm not saying anything.
I don't want to talk about this anymore, okay?
Valentina, this is crazy!
I mean, how can you be in love with someone when you haven't even kissed them?
Are we clear on how I feel about you now?
Good.
No.
Why not?
Because her mom has worked here for 20 years.
Still, after what she did?
I've had a really stressful day, all right?
First school, then you and Valentina.
I'm so glad we hooked up.
It's been cool getting to know you again.
I can't believe how mature you've become.
I was 6 when my mother died, but I didn't cry.
My whole life I thought I could handle anything.
But I'm not strong enough to lose you.
But in order to do that, we have to be absolutely honest with each other.
I will tell you everything that I've learned about Flora in the last two months.
Flora had a plan.
She wanted to get pregnant by a rich man, and then she would blackmail him into supporting that child until the age of 18.
She started having sex with friends of Adrian Powell.
He would pay her for the sessions, but even he had no idea what she really had in mind.
Is this Cody you're meeting with?
Uh... yeah.
He's very handsome.
Mom, it's me.
- Do you really think so?
Been 15 years since he died.
Doesn't seem possible, does it?
I didn't think so, but I had to ask.
Could you forgive me if I caused his death?
Of course not.
Is there any chance you'd want to make love to me tonight?
What a bizarre question.
We allow ourselves one day of the year to talk about our son.
Why are you ruining it?
You're right.
Next year, I'm going to buy Barrett an Armani tux.
Armani?
With his sense of style, he would accept nothing less.
Maybe he'll never be okay.
- Leena's list?
Get out of there before the thief sees you.
How were you gonna save Claudia by jumping in front of a moving car?
No one else is dying on my watch!
I'm really worried about him.
When you asked me to keep an eye on Artie, you said it was to help him.
Trust us.
Please live.
I know I'm not her, okay?
Okay, you know what?
Both jockeys were in perfect health, and they were both riding extreme long shot horses.
Their bodies, they were both drained-- completely drained-- of adrenaline.
Well, obviously, somebody's found a way to win it big on the long shots.
Except that no one bet big on either horse, so go talk to the owners, ask questions, solve it.
And clotted cream.
Mrs. Frederic wants to talk to me about some Regent issue, and bring me back a tin of Digestives.
All right, here's the dirt.
I'm not gonna tell you!
So, go, ta-ta, good-bye, cheerio, so long, be gone.
I know where he is.
And I think I know how to get to him.
Pete, this bishop novel that we got sucked into actually belongs in the...
That's very mature.
You know, we're supposed to be reshelving inventory.
I am, okay?
King Kamehameha's Hawaiian lei transports you to a tropical paradise, so I'm bonding with it to figure out where to shelve it.
Why the hell are you playing with that?
Jeez, Artie, I'm sorry.
Just trying to get some RR.
It's been a rough year.
Yes, that it has.
How about a weekend in Vegas?
Now you're talking.
- Vegas, baby!
- Wait for it.
While you're there, maybe you'd do me a favor and look into something fun that just happened on a golf course.
Okay, so apparently our victim was dead before he landed.
From what?
Hypoxia, cerebral edema, and a pulmonary edema.
They're all consistent with altitude exposure.
- Glowing orange?
Looks like he was staying at the Maximus Hotel And Casino.
Nothing artifact-y.
Maybe the artifact is at the hotel.
We should get to his room before the maid does.
Was he taking any medications?
Any sort of hormone therapy, maybe?
This probably would have been the biggest win of his life.
No doubt.
Trudie Stein was 20 to 1.
Gonna be her last race.
That is quite the win.
Oh, every win's nice.
Purse size stays the same, no matter the odds.
Sure, but I bet she's worth a few more farthings now, say, if you wanted to sell her?
Are you making an implication?
Are you dodging a question?
I grew up in this sport, young lady.
I would never steal a race nor injure a jockey.
He wasn't lying.
Well, I'm sure that he would call us if he had.
Yeah, but he's been so scattered lately.
You know something, don't you?
I know that we need to talk to the owner of the second horse.
And I know what you did there, by the way.
Very tricksy of you.
New nickname.
Oh, my God.
I hope that's a snickers.
Well, we gotta wake 'em up.
Look, we are very sorry about your friend, but we need to know everything that you can remember about last night.
Yeah, anywhere you went, anything weird you might have touched.
Did we go out last night?
Dude, we went to this place where this--
- Uh, I mean, they were...
After the tequila fountain at the pool, it's all kind of fuzzy.
I remember that feeling.
I was fuzzy for about 12 years.
There you go, Myks.
Why don't you, uh, take the Sanagustin Steak House?
I'll take the, uh, Luxy Lounge and then whatever this other place is.
Fine, okay.
I'll take the Luxy Lounge, and we'll do Girls Girls Girls together.
It'll be a lot of fun.
Thanks, dudes.
Annoyed everybody in my section and no tip.
Did you notice anything unusual about them?
So, nothing, you know, freaky or weird then?
I tried to keep them in the hotel, but he was dead set on going to a strip club.
- Was this one with them?
That guy's talking about floating and then he dies in the clouds.
The first time he mentioned it was here, so maybe it's something at the club.
Okay, so, 48 years old, single, a compulsive gambler who just hit it big at the blackjack table.
And probably not last seen floating around a strip club.
Her fingertips had frostbite, her lips were blue, and witnesses saw her glowing orange.
Maybe at the Maximus Hotel And Casino?
Now, I'm gonna take the-- what is this?
- This is Abigail Chow.
Ms. Chow is the new owner of the Bed Breakfast.
New owner?
I don't frighten easily.
- Arthur, is it?
Mrs. Frederic has told me so much about--
So, she was a big blackjack player?
Yes, yes, the schoolteacher.
She was only supposed to stay here for two nights, but I kept her here for five.
And how do you do that?
Val Preston, the hottest act on the strip.
So, Val Preston's a magician.
You're kidding.
The top magician in Vegas.
Devil's Chamber, Sands Of The Nile, Asrah levitation.
Levitation.
Is there any chance you also gave tickets to those boys from the stag party last night?
- Of course.
- Is Preston on tonight?
I imagine he just turned a volunteer into a flock of doves.
Rise!
Houston, we have liftoff.
Sensibility breaks through, followed by horizon on the outside.
You didn't even have to call Artie.
Reminding me, what do you know about this whole Regent issue?
I'm not gonna like this, am I?
And I told them the truth, that he'd been acting erratic.
You ratted on him?
- I'm worried about him.
Look, one thing I learned at the ATF, if an agent is not in control, he doesn't belong in the field.
Artie is in control, he just--
Jumped in front of a moving car with you in the trunk.
You both could've been killed.
Claude, I won't apologize for doing what is right and what I was asked to do by my boss.
We are so not done talking about this.
And where do you think you're going?
- The Stallion Club.
I would suggest you contact your fairy godmother and have her turn you into a princess.
The closest thing I have to a fairy godmother, besides you, is my boss's credit card.
Beg pardon, Sir Henry Baker?
That's right, love.
We're with the Royal Racing Commission.
- We just have a few qu--
Attempted murder-type thing.
Now I'm gonna need to see the records for every horse you've bought or sold in the last year.
Emergency personnel are rushing to the track.
Well, there you have it.
Could you possibly forgive me?
Well, I don't think I'll miss it for a few hours.
Neither would I.
Thanks, Jeeves.
So Mrs. Frederic tells me that you've been working here for quite a while now.
- How long has it been?
- Around 400 years.
Really?
Well, you look good.
You must have built up quite a pension by now.
Yeah, artifacts are shelved according to specific properties that they've got.
Is this Julia Child's apron?
It's not to be touched!
They're never to be touched without proper protection.
It's not a curio shop, Ms. Chow.
- The original Ginsu knife?
It must be a terrible burden to be responsible for all of these things.
Apparently, by slapping perfect strangers.
It's been a very tough year.
Oh, we all have them.
Well, in my case, it's all my fault, so--
Oh, well, it's a rather long story with a very bad ending.
Well, I like long stories.
I don't know.
What exactly did you do before you bought the BB?
A lot of things.
Why do you ask?
Oh, anything in the field of psychotherapy?
Yes.
You have got to be kidding me!
And Mrs. Frederic tells me that you are an innkeeper.
What a great joke that is!
Do you know how humiliating it is...
- The Regents just simply felt--
Otherwise, they wouldn't come up with such a stupid plan.
You all have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss my mental health?
Maybe they can come up with somebody to help you work through your disappointment.
Why are there 48 empty seats out there when the hotel is passing out free tickets like they're Halloween candy?
Val, listen, listen, listen.
Shut up while I'm firing you!
I'm thinking Mr. Presto might not be so cooperative.
Pete, look at this.
So the levitation trick was just a harness.
The desert around Las Vegas is littered with the bodies of nosey people.
We're Secret Service.
I know why you're here.
I told them a jet pack he was using for a new trick malfunctioned.
I've been telling him, you play the same venue for a decade, attendance drops.
He needs new material.
They said he was the hottest act on the strip.
Val's a great performer.
Wait, so Val Preston steals his tricks?
I found him in the Luxy Lounge right here at the Maximus.
That guy's, like, 110.
He's got a big outdoor promotional stunt planned, but he's got nothing new.
The word is, Monty actually has something new.
So Monty uses an artifact to levitate a volunteer, and then sometime later, the volunteer shoots up into the sky.
We have to get to Monty before his next show.
You throw a man like Artie Nielson at me without so much as a warning?
What would you have had me say?
That he's exactly the kind of arrogant, closed off, know-it-all that drove me away from this work.
Dr. Chow, we do not use artifacts to solve our problems.
We prevent the use of them.
Yes, I know.
No, we're...
Well, try not to get him excited.
He's fragile.
We're actually with the Secret Service.
We're just here to ask you a few questions.
Did you recently levitate a Val Preston?
I'd only been doing it a few days, and that bozo Preston came trying to steal it.
Oh, I saw him skulking around the audience with his little camera.
He was hoping to use my trick in his big bamboozala festival tonight.
Well, it doesn't look like he'll be bamboozaling tonight after all.
Monty, if you knew Mr. Preston was trying to steal your trick, then why use him as a volunteer?
Because he'll go nuts trying to figure it out.
And you know why?
It's not a trick.
Well, look, that's kind of why we're here, Monty.
We need you to hand over whatever it is you're using to levitate these people.
Maximus gave me a month to clear my stuff out.
But not now.
Because you found this thing.
Vegas has always known a "wow" factor when it saw one, and boy, have I got a "wow" factor.
But whatever gadget or gizmo you're using to perform this trick, it--it might be dangerous.
You're such a noodge.
What I'm doing is real magic.
So, you're levitating people with just your mind.
And... energy from the audience.
It's what I've-- it's what I've lived for.
This is the moment.
Look, you see, the thing is, Monty, there might be some unfortunate side effects on the people you're levitating.
Is there any way that you could maybe show us how the-- how the trick works?
Well, that would be my great pleasure.
I'd be delighted.
Come to the matinee as my guests.
Silver Princess was already stripped bare but the time I got to her.
Horses had different breeders, different trainers, different everything.
Well, what about race day routines?
Nothing that--
Wait, all three horses saw the track vet with an injury the day before they raced.
A boost of adrenaline.
The Jack of diamonds, right?
What are you, some kind of a kleptomaniac?
Get off the stage, you bum.
So, when he gets to the levitation bit, we pull the plug?
No, we gotta get eyes on the artifact first, and then stop him before he can use it.
I have been performing this amazing feat on volunteers.
However, questions have arisen as to its very safety.
No!
Rose, my lovely Rose.
The government has sent us two of its finest agents to investigate my magic, and I must prove to them that it is safe.
Stand back, government man.
I can't control it.
Monty, where are you going?
Come back.
This is the awesomest artifact whammy ever.
How awesome will it be when you asphyxiate in the clouds?
- A lot less awesome?
- Where is Monty?
He ran off.
I don't think that he meant to levitate you, and if he thought that he couldn't control his trick-- well, it might have scared him.
Does he have a dressing room here?
No, he probably just went home.
Nobody's here, Myks.
Monty's room is clean except for a bunch of heart medication.
The guy's hanging on by a thread.
Man, I hope I have a hot, young girlfriend when I'm his age.
Saint Joseph of Cupertino.
It'd be a great present for someone who's always dreamt of finding real magic.
Yeah, but Myks, he was so sure that he did himself.
Wouldn't it be a better gift not to tell him?
And she knew Monty wouldn't come here.
Needed us out of the way, but why?
So she could run?
I mean, that doesn't feel right.
No, no, she's doing this for Monty.
Pete, what if Rose wanted to give her grandfather a last hurrah.
Like maybe an outdoor promotional event.
Myks, we told Monty that Val couldn't make it tonight.
Let's go.
Knew I'd find you here.
He's with the government.
It's their job to pretend that things that they don't understand are dangerous.
Sweetheart, I think I'm done.
When your knees go, you stop dancing.
And when you can't do what you do best, you walk away with dignity.
That's ridiculous.
We used to fill this place, your grandma and I.
Standing room only.
Well, then let's prove to the world that you're the greatest there is, and then walk away with dignity.
I'm not gonna put anyone else in danger.
You know, I hear Val Preston's disappeared.
Might not even show up for his Val-apalooza.
Yeah, that's what they said too.
So we'll steal his audience.
Levitate me outside.
We'll knock their socks off.
"Steal his audience"?
Now you're talking.
I have no idea why those particular horses are winning.
I know that you're telling the truth, but what about their injuries?
Were there any similarities between them?
No, the first one had a leg strain, the second one had lacerations on her abdomen, and the third one had minor burns on the back of his neck.
What, burns?
Is that even legal?
The leg strain can come from running an animal harder than necessary and the lacerations from an illegally long whip, but all very difficult to prove.
Well, my assistant takes all of the bookings.
Just in last night with a bruised deltoid.
Obviously, his jockey cropped him far too hard.
Devil's share's in the next race.
Cupertino's medal.
Well, rumor confirmed.
But why are people shooting up into the sky?
Well, that's inconclusive, and Cupertino was not in control of his ability to levitate.
In fact, the church banned him from public ceremonies.
They were afraid that he would incite chaos.
Well, maybe that's the downside.
The victims of levitation later lose control.
Yeah, something's gotta trigger these victims going up a second time.
Yeah, well, let's look into that ASAP, shall we?
In any case, make sure that--
Artie, who's there?
No one.
Just make sure you keep a roof over Pete's head until you bag the artifact.
Pancho Villa's boots.
You're here to check them out like this is a library?
You're hilarious.
I am not the one that is new here.
I know about this, Artie.
A man who insists on fighting his battle alone, who shuts everyone out until his grief consumes him and there's nothing left but fury and sadness and self-loathing.
I'm glad I'm so easy to categorize.
Why don't you just save everyone the torment of watching you self-destruct and put on the boots?
Only your struggle.
A patient.
Grief, Agent Nielson, real, gut-wrenching grief is not something you can power through or ignore.
There's no detours, no shortcuts.
You look it in the eye and you do battle, and you keep doing battle until you are finished with it, and it is finished with you.
And if you're not willing to accept that, then it will eat you alive.
And yes, he was a patient.
I am Monty The Magnificent!
Real magic.
Liar!
You too, sonny.
Focus on Rose.
It's on a chain around her neck.
All right, all right, that's good to know.
Now what's the--
I think I found out what the trigger is.
Pete, what are you doing?
Ah, this is probably a bad idea.
You think?
How'd you get up here?
No, that's--that's impossible.
Oh, my gosh, this is gonna crush Monty.
Only if I fall on him.
Just take us down.
Myka, wait.
He said you wouldn't tell him.
Please, Monty has to believe.
Oh, so what I thought was real magic was in fact just some cheap trick?
It--it's real.
Like they say, there's no fool like an old fool.
Gramps.
Ricky Jackson?
Yeah, maybe they are, but you're not judge and jury.
They should be punished.
Are you a murderer, Ricky?
It should be underneath the saddle.
I'm from the racing commission, and I said dismount.
And I said piss off.
What the bloody hell are you doing?
That's a really bad feeling.
Tell your friends.
It's right in here, Monty.
Robert Houdin-- they called him the father of modern magic.
There's no tricks here, Monty.
Most people just aren't ready for it.
You're one of the few people who have seen this place.
We figured that you could keep a secret.
Huh, this guy.
Yeah, people do all kinds of things when they want to protect somebody.
Look, I get it.
Karma?
What am I doing here?
I killed someone I loved.
I don't know what to do about it.
Let's talk.
I'm learning how to survive, but there are complications.
That what you actually felt for me was real.
How together are they?
He said there was a cure.
And we're not the only ones who want it...
I want to ram it down Niklaus' throat.
But uncovering it comes with a price.
What do you know about Silas?
He's the world's first immortal being, who just happens to be imprisoned with the cure.
So what do you say, partners?
The race for the cure has begun, but how far will we have to go to find it?
I was beginning to worry you boys wouldn't find the place.
Did you kill all these people?
Killing them is your job.
You have to kill vampires to complete the hunter's mark.
Mark equals cure.
You're in a bar full of almost vampires, so get your hunt on.
I don't take orders from you, dick.
Hunters can't be compelled.
You're right.
I can't compel you, but if your conscience is getting in the way, then allow me to make this easy for you because I can compel them.
I'm taking artistic license.
You know he can't take them all on at the same time.
Go with him.
Are you ok?
You set us up.
Now you have to fight your way out of it.
Where are the other vampires?
They're gonna kill Matt.
Jeremy, where are you?
Are you ok?
Oh, my God.
Jeremy, what's going on?
They're coming.
What the hell were you thinking?
All I asked you to do was to teach him how to fight.
But the mark grew, didn't it?
There's a group of compelled vampires out there, and as soon as the sun goes down, they're gonna come after Matt, so we have to find a away to protect him.
Yes, I know, but there will be no problem when big Jer and I here go on a hunting expedition.
Elena, I know it's tragic, I get it, but we also agree that he had to kill them.
Now we have added incentive, so you take the least most valuable player home, and Jeremy and I will finish this.
I know you were, uh, daggered for a little while, but, uh, knocking is still a thing.
Until we find the cure, right?
Team Klaus has Jeremy the hunter, team Shane has Bonnie the witch.
The cure is buried with Silas, that ancient evil guy my brother Kol is afraid of.
Shane was so eager to prove his existence that he gave away that he has on of the keys to resurrecting him, his headstone.
Bonnie, look at me.
You are strong, you are focused.
You are in complete control.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to keep you alive, dumbass.
Something's not right.
I did it.
It was a little crowded when I arrived, and I prefer more intimate gatherings.
We 3 need to have a little chat.
Care for a drink?
He's underage, and I don't like you, so let's just cut to it.
My brother bragged about his plan to complete Jeremy's hunter's mark.
Now killing young vampires is easy or old ones for that matter.
What do you know of him?
You know, being an immortal, you can see why I'm opposed to time's ending.
I murdered all of them, and now here you are willing to risk raising him in your search for the cure.
Why don't you call off this imbecilic treasure hunt?
I'm not calling anything off, mate.
Jeremy, run!
Don't ripper out on me.
The Professor's stash of herbs.
Not interested.
What happened to you?
You were so much fun in the twenties.
I was a psychotic killer with no emotions in the 1920s.
You may have been a killer, but you were far from emotionless, Stefan.
The jazz, the booze, our little table at Gloria's.
Don't make me compel it out of you.
You're accusing me of orchestrating a mass murder?
Do you know how ridiculous that sounds.
It's Mystic Falls.
It's actually one of the least ridiculous things I've heard.
I'm going in there.
Bonnie, no, you're not.
If he's gonna tell anyone what he did, it's me.
Unless of course you think I'm too weak-minded.
Bonnie, now is not the time.
Let her talk.
I think your dad's confused about the format of the parent-teacher conference.
You know, the truth is, she's not.
When I asked you to stay to Jeremy, I never thought... what did you expect, Elena?
Sire bond doesn't work like that.
All I know, Elena, is that the old you would have never left Jeremy with Damon, especially after what happened last night.
And my little brat of a brother has gone and made things worse.
Well, he never did like Damon.
I suppose I should do something, shouldn't I?
Call him off, Klaus.
You are in no position to make demands, love.
Whatever our differences, we want the same thing.
Those vampires were for my hunter.
Where's Damon Salvatore.
If you're gonna kill me, do it like a man.
You ought to be thanking me.
The last vestige of her humanity is her annoying little brother Jeremy, and deep, deep down, I bet you want him dead, don't you?
Nope.
You're not gonna remember what I say, but you're going to find Jeremy Gilbert, and when you do, you're going to kill him.
He saved your life.
Whatever's inside of me that makes me want to hunt, right now it's on overdrive.
I'm sorry.
So much random crap in here.
Looks like Shane has a bit of an afterlife fetish.
Hopi prayer feathers, the han dynasty soul vase, and that is a polynesian sacrificial knife.
Brutal way to die, but at least you appease the gods.
Since when did you become such an artifact expert?
I enjoy other cultures, Stefan.
I know that might be hard for you to understand considering you dated a child who only thinks about herself.
Still a sensitive subject, I see.
Do you know why I wouldn't compel Elena from your memory?
It's liberating actually.
You know why we had so much fun in the twenties, Stefan?
Because we didn't care.
We just did what felt good... drinking, feeding, sex.
Crazy sex is always good.
You were hardly the model of sanity.
Question is who are you?
Kol happened.
Told my dad to give us a minute.
I'm not a killer, Bonnie.
If they knew people had to die... it doesn't matter if they die.
Silas will bring them back.
You're full on crazy.
Do you remember our first session?
Aren't you curious what's happening to her now?
Wouldn't you like to see her again?
Are you all right?
What's going on?
Jeremy, are you listening to me?
You better run!
All you have to do to make it stop is tell me who sent you.
You're full of vervain, so I know you haven't been compelled.
Or maybe somebody compelled him before he ingested it.
That's not a bad idea.
He just bit off his own tongue.
So he does know something.
I guess he was compelled.
Was it my bastard brother or yours?
Maybe it's option number 3.
There's another team in the race.
You're saying if I help you raise Silas you can bring my grams back?
Don't play on my guilt, Shane.
I'm not playing on anything.
Your reckless use of magic is the reason... don't.
I said don't!
You can't stop, can you?
All this power that you're feeling, you actually like it, don't you?
Bonnie, what are you doing?
Get out.
Now take a deep breath.
You are in complete control.
That's it.
Hello, Elena.
Stefan's not in the mood to talk right now.
Then he can listen.
Ok.
That is an interesting predicament for both of us.
Did you miss the part where I said I'm compelled?
Don't stop!
Seriously?
You're being hunted by a vampire, and now you're bleeding?
He shot me in the head.
I told Nik I wouldn't touch the kid.
You'd really dagger me?
If I do, Damon's compulsion ends and this is all over.
Daggering siblings when you disagree with them... look at what this family has become.
I mean, Elijah won't even show his face he's so disgusted by our bickering.
This cure has ruined us, and it hasn't even been found yet.
Just imagine what would happen if it is.
This family was ruined long before we knew about the cure.
Enough of this foolishness.
He was going to kill me.
Well, then, I think you need a lesson in how to properly dagger a sibling.
Burn in hell.
Damon, stop!
I know that you don't want to hurt Jeremy, so please stop.
Why, because Stefan did?
Because I love you, because you love me.
I'm sorry, Elena.
Shoot now.
You're welcome.
So you bled me out?
Kol's compulsion is still in effect, so you need to stay locked up.
You sound real torn up about it.
Shouldn't we be going after Kol, make him decompel me.
It's too risky.
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
It's better for Elena if you stay in here for now, at least until we find the cure, and then once she's no longer sired and you're no longer compelled, you can both do whatever the hell you want.
Going to see Damon?
I need to talk to him.
I won't let him out.
That all?
Stefan, what are you doing with Rebekah?
She tried to kill me.
So I guess nobody's perfect, right?
Are you trying to punish me?
I don't know how many times I can apologize.
You've just never seen me like this.
You don't know what I look like when I'm not in love with you.
I'll let Damon know you stopped by.
I owe you an apology.
You don't owe me anything.
Help?
Dad, I'm ok.
Are you kidding me?
I got angry I admit, but I knew what I was doing.
You lost control, and Shane said... didn't we just establish that we couldn't trust him?
And the fact that you don't think you need help means you need it even more.
Good evening, Gilbert clan.
What do you want, Klaus?
I've come to fetch my hunter.
Fine, but when Kol does come... and he will come... be sure to let me know, preferably before he burns your nice little home to the ground.
And as for you, hunter, there's no shortage of people to turn and loved ones to threaten, so sleep well.
We'll plan on finishing our work tomorrow.
So where'd you put it?
Did you work things out with Elena?
Do you even have to ask?
No feelings, no attachments.
None...
This is never gonna end.
If Kol doesn't kill me first, then Klaus is just gonna force me to kill more innocent people.
How many is it gonna take, 10, 100?
If you kill one original vampire, their entire sire line will die with them.
That's thousands, maybe tens of thousands of vampires.
Kol compelled Damon to kill you.
You're gonna kill Kol instead.
Previously on Revenge...
If you attempt to alert Daniel to our resurgent relationship, your son will be removed permanently.
There is $50,000 for your signature and a swift departure.
All we need is The Stowaway, and we can regain that foothold that he once had.
Ashley, could you please close the door?
Padma referred to Carrion as a program.
I never told her that.
Remember what's at stake for you if you don't find the Carrion program.
Aiden, what happened?
It's done.
They made it look like an overdose.
If there's a chance that my sister's alive, then I'm gonna find her.
It's my wedding, Daddy.
It looks like you're preparing one fancy event.
What are these pipe cleaners?
These are very nice rings.
So who is the lucky guy?
Hey, Mr. Clarke.
Well, uh, I think you're just in time.
But when that bond is broken, our essence is forever changed.
Any news on Aiden's whereabouts?
You don't think he'd go after the Initiative on his own?
They just murdered his sister.
At this point, I don't know what he'll do.
If they make contact, I'll know.
All that matters is that he's happy.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, and what about the marshland to the east?
Once you announce your gubernatorial plans, those on the city council will be eager to earn favor with New York's next governor.
We're fully aware of your contribution thus far and in no way seek to minimize your role in the project.
A rising tide lifts all boats.
The Graysons were and always will be the enemy.
Take this to the bank and get a cashier's check for whatever amount you owe him, plus interest, for his trouble.
Thank you.
You guys really got this whole parenting thing down.
Oh, that compliment sounds like it's got a favor attached to it.
You're up later than usual.
The fact that she agreed to my proposition should call her own motives into question.
Oh, say what you want about Emily, but at least she had the courage to tell me the truth, which is more than I can say about you.
Lock the door behind you.
Run the video.
See, there was nothing you or Emily could've done to prevent this.
And Emily is no more to blame in this than you are.
I tracked the electrical meter from the video to a condemned apartment building in Jersey City.
Did he say what he was expecting to find?
I don't even think he knows.
The Initiative has him second-guessing everything.
Their father was the real target.
Aiden's dad was a baggage handler at Heathrow.
He loaded the bomb on to Flight 197.
Colleen was never heard from again.
Do you think there's a possibility that the Initiative is doing the same thing to Padma?
Maybe they got to her family, too.
I don't know, but right now all I care about is finding Aiden.
In the meantime, I need you to hack into the Jersey City police system.
Cross-check all Jane Does from six years ago with Colleen's description.
We're comfortable with the short-term losses.
Daniel, our final plans are much grander in scope.
Algiers, Bahrain, Tunisia...
These are all highly volatile regions with unregulated banking systems.
Which is precisely why we are investing in their infrastructure.
These emerging governments need the financial backing of Western companies to facilitate reform.
They set me up, Victoria.
Victoria, are you there?
I'm sorry, David.
There's nothing I can do for you.
Please don't call me again.
It's time we start enjoying our lives a little more.
Why do you have a check from Emily?
And why are there so many zeroes?
She wants us to convert it to a cashier's check and buy back the bar from Conrad.
I don't want to be in debt to any of my friends.
You'd rather be in debt to your enemies?
Do I have to remind you what happened last time?
I almost lost you.
Perhaps it'd be best if you gave us a moment of privacy.
I need a copy of every transaction you ever made on behalf of the Initiative in the '90s, the same ones that the government used to convict David Clarke.
He'll be culpable of whatever catastrophe they're about to unleash.
Now unfortunately, my son no longer listens to me, let alone trusts a word I have to say.
But faced with hard evidence, perhaps he can be convinced.
Now do you have the documents or not?
How can I talk you out of anything if I don't know what you're thinking?
I didn't come here to fight.
I was 12.
I never saw her again.
It's Nolan.
He's been looking into coroner reports since 2007.
Jack, what a pleasant surprise.
I don't know about you, but I think the community has far outgrown its antiquated, albeit charming, blue-collar mystique.
I think you're forgetting that I still own half my bar, and I'm not selling if that's what you expect me to do.
Jack, I'm afraid you don't fully grasp your current inexorable station, so allow me to educate you.
As we speak, the bank is reassessing your financial viability as a mortgage holder, and I think we both know that you fail to meet even the most lenient threshold for continued approval.
Now this assessment is going to trigger an assumption clause, allowing me to absorb your debt and own the bar outright.
Good-bye, Jack.
They're pulling the coroner's files from archives.
Is it Daniel?
Aiden, he doesn't matter right now.
Daniel, hi.
The truth is, I appreciated your honesty.
Not everyone would be so understanding.
Well, learning how to forgive and forget is practically a survival technique in my family.
After everything Amanda's been through in her life, she deserves to be happy, even if it's just for this one day.
Here you go, Ms. Thorne.
That's her.
That's my sister.
You were right.
You wanted to see me?
You mind closing the doors?
Padma, I know you must think that I've been avoiding you.
I think you are... something else entirely.
People have been lining up to use me since I made the cover of Wired at 22, so...
Then suddenly nothing.
Hey, careful who you're calling black, little kettle.
I am taking a huge risk right now, going against the better judgment of someone I trust a lot more than you, because my feelings for you... defy logic.
Well, as I explained to your fiance, my share is not for sale.
You couldn't be more wrong about that.
It'll work because he trusts me.
How can you be so sure?
- Where did you get this?
So it has been you all this time.
I haven't even begun to make you and your family suffer for what they've done.
And after you've apologized and wished him well...
You never, ever utter the name Porter again, or I promise, I will take a wrecking ball to every bit of this pathetic excuse for a life you've chosen.
Mr. Ryan, uh, yes, it's, uh, Conrad Grayson.
I'm afraid our plan to revitalize Montauk has, uh, run into a bit of a snag.
Colleen deserved better than this.
Aiden, I'm so sorry.
I am gonna track them down and put a bullet in each one of their heads.
You don't understand, do you?
Just because you couldn't save Colleen, it doesn't mean... that you can't honor her.
You know, we just have to approach this with a clear head.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not as cold and calculated as you.
I can't just turn my feelings on and off at the flick of a switch.
That I don't feel?
That I don't miss my father every single day?
That I don't mourn the life that I could have had?
But that's why people like you and me fight.
Because it gives us something to live for when everything else has been taken away.
We can do this together, Aiden.
Don't go.
Aiden, don't leave me alone in this.
With my signature here, the bar is yours, Mr. Porter.
I don't get it.
What changed?
Well, it turns out the Coastal Commission caught a whiff of our intentions and threatened to keep us in the courts for years.
So how about you simply thank me and I leave this establishment forever?
How about you just leave?
With pleasure.
A month ago, my mother called to tell me my father had left for a business trip and that she hadn't heard from him for three days.
Not that I'd expect you to believe any of this.
Well, let's just say for now I do.
They wanted me to locate a code for a program you'd written called Carrion.
How did they know it even existed?
Lucky for humanity, I gave you an incomplete version of it.
So you knew all along?
Guys, Crowley isn't asking for an analysis of the metrics.
She understands the volatility of these markets.
Now I asked you to execute the purchase order, so do it already.
If you execute this deal, you're going to come to regret it for the rest of your life, however short it will be.
What's this?
Just read it, Daniel.
And they have planned for you what they did to us all those years ago when your father inadvertently helped down Flight 197.
Now if you go down the road with these people, you're not only endangering yourself, but everyone that you care for, including Emily Thorne.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
Because they made threats against your life, forcing my silence.
And they will make good on these threats if they ever find out we've spoken.
Your father and I have a compilation of evidence that should neutralize Helen Crowley and the Initiative.
Yes, I'm watching.
We join here on this beautiful day to celebrate the union of our dear friends
Jack Porter and Amanda Clarke, two people who found true love, trust, and friendship in a world that rarely makes that easy.
Patience, please.
May I have the rings, please?
Oh, my God.
This just goes to show how long this was coming.
When we were kids, Amanda and I actually acted out this day.
But when I was old enough to recognize it as love, you were gone.
You were always in my heart.
Jack Porter, you are the most... incredible person I know...
The most kind and loving and generous.
With you, my life is complete.
Unfortunately, there are times when the other side possesses leverage, which, shall we say, rendered the fight too costly.
Okay, look, let's say somebody was able to remove this leverage you're talking about.
Is the deal back on?
As it stands, Mr. Ryan, that's a purely hypothetical question.
We never had this conversation.
Uh, I had Jack and Amanda's wedding.
Oh, was that today?
Guess I'm a little out of touch these days.
Well, you are running a major investment firm.
It's not exactly last summer.
No, it's not, is it?
Not at all.
Are you okay?
You know, it's been a hell of a summer, and I've got a lot on my plate at work.
I just think it's best that we wait for the dust to settle a bit.
Not right now anyway.
See you soon, buddy.
You be a good little sleeper for these guys.
Smile, Mr. and Mrs. Porter.
Bon voyage.
Conrad, is that you?
It's just us.
I thought you above all people would have known better than to test our resolve.
How the hell did you get in here?
Did I not make it abundantly clear there would be deadly repercussions for warning Daniel against us?
If you do anything to harm him, I swear that I will...
You'll what, neutralize me?
Only when he gets downstairs, his regular driver will have taken the night off, and you will never see your boy again.
You monster.
Takes one to know one, hmm?
You know, it'll be almost a shame when I finally have to dispense with you.
The evidence.
Or shall we make that call to Daniel?
The safe is behind that mirror.
Okay, that's enough.
I'll take it from here.
The combination, please.
It's empty.
This isn't.
You're not gonna kill me.
This is Daniel.
Listen to me carefully, Daniel.
Hello, Helen.
Say you're sorry I couldn't make it, but that you'll be happy to reschedule for tomorrow.
Meet me in the pool house, and I'll explain everything to you when you get home.
What the hell is going on?
Oh, my God.
How's this?
I think I left them on the boat along with my laptop.
Do you think it's okay if we call and ask 'em where they keep the extra pacifiers?
Do phones even work out there in the middle of the ocean?
Does no one answer a phone anymore?
Amanda Clarke stopped by earlier today.
It seems we have a rather extraordinary problem on our hands.
I'll go first.
What on earth have you done?
I won't allow myself to become another casualty of these people.
My sister deserves better, as do you.
They will still pay, but... on our terms.
I lost Daniel.
You know, you were right about everything you said yesterday, except one thing.
An abiding drive to connect, to love, to belong.
In a perfect union, we find the strength we cannot find in ourselves.
You dig up Silas, and you've got your cure.
There is only one dose.
I really want to get that cure for you.
If I gave you the cure to save yourself, you'd give it to Elena, wouldn't you?
We all wanted to help Elena get the damn thing...
We risked everything to get it.
It's been too long, little Gilbert.
And we failed.
How'd this happen?
What about the cure or Silas?
Damon, listen to me.
Jeremy was one of the five, a hunter.
He's supernatural.
The ring won't work anymore.
She won't survive this.
I'm just gonna sit here and wait with him until he wakes up.
Unless you're a blond, a Bennett witch, or a doppelganger, I suggest you steer clear.
- We need to find Katherine.
If there's one thing that's a guarantee in this miserable, little world, it's that Katherine Pierce is gone.
If he was asleep in that cave, he's awake now.
Don't touch it.
I know you're angry with me, ok, but now you'll see, everything I did, all those lives lost, they weren't in vain.
You can't bring back the dead.
I think you'll change your mind now.
What do you mean, now?
What are you saying to me?
He drained him of his blood, Bonnie.
Jeremy is dead.
She hasn't said anything except that she's waiting for him to wake up.
She feels grief more powerfully than anyone else.
I think her denial is the one thing protecting her from letting it all in.
She can't stay like that forever.
I'm not in denial.
I know that he was supernatural, but did you see?
His tattoo is gone.
The tattoo had the spell that opened Silas' chamber.
It may be miniscule, but it's hope, and I'm gonna hold on to that hope with everything that I've got because there's no way...
There's absolutely no way that my brother is dead.
I'm not in denial.
Do you know where he is?
As far away from Klaus as he can get.
Klaus said he wouldn't stop until he found him.
And now without any family.
What's that smell?
It's his body.
He's starting to decompose.
Tell you mom to get Dr. Fell over here.
Do you think Bonnie is dead?
I don't like being out in the open like this.
My brother Kol drove himself mad worrying about Silas rising.
Hey, somebody needed to find Bonnie.
Stefan could've done that.
Aren't you Elena's current love?
It's so hard to keep track these days.
Shouldn't you be home comforting her, or are you terrified of being there when she realizes her brother is dead?
Mm, just the guy I wanted to see.
Jeremy is dead.
You're gonna see Jeremy again.
What are you doing here?
I came to check on your brother.
May I?
He'd just be dead until then he wasn't.
Once, I remember he was gone for almost an entire day.
His neck also appears to be broken.
I need you to release the body to me.
Now you're all about science?
Where was your science when you used vampire blood to save my life, huh?
Elena...
You're not dosing me again, are you?
Poison your best friend once, and suspicion follows you forever.
You're mean to the people that you care about.
That's some messed-up logic.
Please.
So what do you know, huh?
I was tracking dens of vampires across Colorado.
Katherine found me, said she could help me find Silas.
Oh, she had someone on the inside, some werewolf girl, friends with your Professor.
Hayley, Tyler Lockwood's old friend.
I wanted that cure for her because it's what she wanted.
You might think I'm afraid to go back, but I'm not because I know what she needs.
She needs me to bring her best friend home.
We got to get you home if you're gonna help Silas raise the dead.
I don't understand what I can do.
Well, Silas can't do magic.
That's why I've been teaching you expressions, so you can do his work for him.
What?
Using the power of 3 massacres.
Each massacre of 12 marks the earth with power, and you can use expression to tap into that power.
Won't you if it meant you can see Jeremy again, your grams, everybody you and your friends ever lost?
I think you would.
No.
No.
He asked you to help him, didn't he?
He needs your help.
You can do this, Bonnie.
You know you can.
I'll do whatever it takes.
I've been alive for almost two centuries now.
You'd think with the amount of people that I've seen die, it would hurt less each time.
I see this every day.
Sometimes I think that denial is the worst part for people like us because we know the truth.
We can see they're on a collision course with it, and all we can do is brace ourselves for impact.
Did you find her?
She's losing it, Damon.
I think you have to.
At this point, the sire bond is probably the only thing that's gonna keep Elena together.
I can go back to find Bonnie.
I'm on my way.
I could actually hug you right now.
Shane led the way.
I know how to bring Jeremy back.
You brought me to the stoner pit?
I want you to see something.
Then she wasn't.
My point is, this town, this crazy-ass world we live in, sometimes not being willing to accept that someone is gone is because maybe they're not...
At least not completely.
Is that really what you believe?
Thanks, Matt.
She knows what to do, doesn't she?
Killing Silas is your supernatural destiny, not mine.
I found it in the chamber where he lay.
How do you hide from the devil when you don't know what he looks like?
Maybe I'm him.
Mark my words, if you don't use the cure to kill him, doesn't matter if you're human or vampire.
You're doomed.
We all are.
So I was thinking about it, and you probably ditched your phone, which is the smartest thing that you could do.
So when you get this, call me back, and I'll tell you everything.
We were so, so worried.
They said that she knows what to do.
Caroline, I need to talk to my brother.
What's wrong?
Then you will see him again.
There's just a few things we have to do first.
What?
Bonnie, you can't kill 12 people.
I know it sounds crazy, but it's the only way to get enough power.
To do what?
When Silas was buried by the witch Qetsiyah, she left him with the cure and two choices...
Stay mortal and rot or take the cure and eventually die in there of old age.
He's been trapped in there for 2,000 years.
At some point, wouldn't death by old age have been better?
How?
I mean, the whole flight back home, all she could talk about was how she's the one that can drop the veil between this side and the other side.
Once the veil is dropped, the other side doesn't exist anymore.
Bonnie, you are talking like a crazy person.
You are not killing 12 people, and you sure as hell can't invite every monster who has ever died back into this world.
He's dead.
Where's Bonnie?
- Put his body on the couch.
Elena, you need help finding something?
Got it.
What are you doing?
Elena, stop it.
Why, because you want me to not be in denial?
I don't want these sketches.
I don't want this Xbox.
Not gonna need this bourbon anymore.
Alaric is not here to drink it, I mean, unless you guys are willing to bring back every supernatural creature on the other side to get him hick.
Would you, Damon?
Because I wouldn't.
I mean, there's no room in the Gilbert family plot.
Jenna and John took the last spots.
Every inch of this house is filled with memories of the people that I love that have died...
I can help you.
I want you to let me help you.
I can help you.
How?
Turn it off.
What?
Just turn it off.
I need you, and there's no way that yesterday was the last time that I'm ever going to see you or talk to you.
Please.
It's gonna be ok, Matt, you'll see.
I'll bring him back.
Did you tell them?
What about the 12 people that died on the Young farm?
They were a necessary sacrifice for the greater good.
It wasn't, and you know it.
When she's ready, I'll use the sire bond to bring her back.
Her humanity, Damon, it was all she had left.
Humanity means nothing when you don't have anyone to care about, Stefan.
She had you.
She lost her brother.
I'm not enough, not this time.
I want you to know that, um...
I know, Stefan.
Elena, don't do this.
What if one day when this is all over, you want to come home again?
I won't.
Hi, it's Ivan.
I got your message.
I'm on my way and I'll get there.
I'm in the car now and... it will be about an hour and a half, unless there's traffic.
Or if the doctors or anybody at all, if they need to talk to me, I'll be on this number.
Now, it'll be okay.
I will get there and the traffic should be okay.
Can I ask who's calling?
It's Ivan Locke.
- Can I say what it's regarding?
- Yes, concrete.
Hello?
Yeah, what did you say about coming home?
I won't be back for the match.
I'll have to listen to it on the radio.
Dad, you said you'd be back.
Ls your brother there?
I just got your message.
It's a joke, is it?
Look, I know it's a shock, but it will be okay.
Yes, well, I will go through everything with you and it'll be okay.
I'm turning the fucking van around.
- What the fuck's happened?
I don't have a choice.
Is it one of the kids?
Just from when the sun comes up tomorrow morning until when it's all been pumped.
I need you to hold it together for me, okay?
Ivan, at 5:45 tomorrow morning, we have 350 metric tons of wet concrete being delivered to the site.
Okay, this is a joke, is it?
I have no choice.
I've never even shoveled on a pump this big!
- What does Gareth say about this?
- I haven't spoken to him yet.
I know, Donal.
Jesus, you're the best foreman I've ever fucking worked with!
So, start rounding up some cowboys and then call me back.
I'll be on the road.
Where are you?
Did they say how long?
- I know what that means, but how long?
It's like a pain I've never had right inside, all the way up to my chest.
Ivan, what do you mean?
Well, just have whatever there is, seriously.
It's cold and all the windows are open.
Tell them to close the windows.
I'll be there.
Have you even told your wife that someone's having your baby?
I'm about to do that.
Do you love me?
That's a question you're asking probably because of the pain or something.
How could I love you?
Hi, love.
I am finally wearing the shirt.
Did Eddie not give you the message?
- What message?
- I'm not coming home.
Which phone are you on?
Can you take this call upstairs, on the phone upstairs?
Upstairs?
Well, can't it wait until you get home?
I won't be home.
What's happened?
Just go to the phone in the bedroom and I'll tell you what's happened.
Dad, I can't believe the team he's picked.
Yeah.
- She?
- She was a secretary, quite old.
She's quite old and she lives on her own.
Look, after the block was settled in, there were some drinks to celebrate.
Now, the block going in is a big thing because it's the base of a whole building.
And she came back to the guesthouse.
She isn't what you would call an oil painting, but it was wet and cold, and she talked about being lonely and I talked about being happy.
Hello, Gareth.
Speak to me only about tomorrow morning, Ivan.
The truth is, tonight I'm going to become a father.
And she's in London, so I have to be there.
- Are you listening?
Best wishes, Mitchell."
That is Mitchell Dean himself, the president of the whole fucking company.
Did you hear that, Ivan?
From Chicago, USA.
Yes.
And so, you're the man in charge of the entire operation, but with 10 hours to go, you've decided you ain't gonna be there!
Well, Donal will handle it and he's a good man.
Don't you fucking dare say that to me!
Don't you fucking dare give qualitative appraisals on my staff and say "good man," like he's going off to buy a fucking ice cream!
Jesus, this is fucking concrete.
Like babies.
And so, it's not your wife giving birth?
Yes, I know, I am the last person on earth, but it happened.
She has no friends in London and is quite a fragile person.
And because the baby was caused by me.
That is my decision I have made.
I have not behaved in the right way with this woman at all.
I have behaved in a way that isn't like me.
But now I am going to do the right thing.
What, and Chicago can go to fucking hell?
Do you know how many millions of pounds are riding on tomorrow?
If any one of those pumps fucks up, Ivan, we are facing 10 million pounds worth of losses in 15 minutes.
Are you still there, Ivan?
Mes, yes.
This is a fucking joke, Ivan.
I'm gonna call Chicago, right?
Ivan, have you lost your fucking mind?
I have made my decision.
What the fuck are you looking at?
It's a familiar predicament to a man like you, isn't it, Dad, eh?
Well, that's where you're wrong.
Listen to me, you fucking piece of worthless shit.
I want you to watch.
Do you know, in fact, I would like to take a fucking shovel and dig you up out of the fucking ground and make you watch me tonight.
I would pull open your eyes and kick the mud and worms and shit out of your fucking ears just for the duration of this journey.
Yes, Donal.
Okay, okay, I'm driving back now so I'm gonna be quick.
I called Ryan and I got half a dozen Poles off him, and I got some Hungarians from Patrick.
I've got breakfast tickets for the concrete farmers, and the shutter boys are done, apart from the fucking-about with the clips.
I've asked Albanian Alby to test the pumps on the Argyll side, and he said that they're pissing it out.
Listen, when you get back on site, you check every pump yourself, individually and with your own hand on the turner.
You don't ask anybody else to check and sign off.
You go around the whole site and you check each one yourself.
And you don't trust Alby after 5:00 because he drinks, okay?
- Okay, okay.
- Now, will you talk to me about the mix?
You've got the client sign-off?
Yeah, yeah, and the client sign-off on the gates.
That's what I mean, the gate sign-off.
C6 on the nose or we send those trucks back.
Seriously, those fuckers will fuck you up with the water in the gullies if it rains tomorrow.
I've got a direct line to God up in heaven, you know.
Donal, you don't trust God when it comes to concrete.
I'm guessing Chicago's going to fire me and he'll put some fucking kid on it, so...
- Did you call?
- Are you okay?
Did you talk to anyone about the pain?
- No, no one's been in.
- But is everything all right?
You must speak to someone about the pain.
Just then I felt like I hate you.
And it will go up and down, I suppose, but at least I'm coming, okay?
The traffic is fine so it'll be okay.
- Please be quick.
- Yes, but there's a speed limit.
- Hello, Gareth.
- Yeah, look.
Okay.
- Nine years.
They've decided you're fired, completely, as of right this second.
I know, I heard you, and I don't blame them, okay?
Tonight and tomorrow, I will stay on this and stay on this and make sure the concrete gets poured right.
I know I don't have a job anymore, but I will do this anyway as a favor to the building and to the concrete.
Why didn't you just say you were sick?
Because I'm not sick, and I'll make sure the pour is okay.
Katrina, I want to move to a practical next step.
No, I will give the baby my name and it will see my face.
I've closed the door and I'm in the dark, and I'm almost sure this isn't you.
Please don't be you.
- I suppose I gotta get up.
- Katrina, please, don't go.
But I just got off the phone with the plant in Stafford, and they said they know that it's a C6 mix, but how far towards C5 can it go?
In other words, if one truck had some C5, how bad would that be taken?
Are you still there?
Donal, what does it say on the whiteboard?
And you know why?
At sunset, it will cast a shadow probably a mile long.
You make one mistake, Donal, one little fucking mistake, and the whole world comes crashing down around you.
- C6 it is.
- Thank you.
- Kat, please, listen.
Ls your mother there?
- All right.
Hello, this is Sister Margaret from St. Mary's maternity unit.
Ls everything okay?
I am the father.
She's quite distressed, and we were wondering if someone was gonna be with her for the birth.
She said she doesn't have anyone else.
Is she all right?
- Well, there's a complication.
- What is the complication?
It's a complication with the umbilical cord, and it means there will be a procedure, and it would help if Dad was around.
Yes, Well, I will, I'll be there.
I think she's normally a very quiet person.
I'm driving.
Yes, Donal.
Right, I've checked all the 12 pumps myself and they're all pissing it out.
- Yes, yeah, I see only C6.
And just so you know, they all gave me dog's abuse for checking.
Excellent, and they have the trucks lined up and the mix is in?
The retardant's on site already, ready to go into the trucks.
- I have a pencil.
Well, get a pen.
Now, it's in the drawer above the blow-heater.
Fuck.
All the things you are going to need, and I have it fucking here in my car.
What the fuck's going on?
Will you just give me some time to think?
Fuck!
- Katrina, don't let the boys hear.
The difference between never and once is the difference between good and bad.
- I know that.
- You fucked someone.
I remember you smiling and putting your coat on the stairs.
I thought you'd won something.
I was trying to be normal.
Yes, she's having the baby tonight.
Is she?
She doesn't.
If she fucks you, she fucks everybody.
I can't believe it's me and you and we're talking about somebody else.
Did you say she's not like that?
Did you say sad?
Hang on a second.
A nice bottle of fizzy pop.
- Right, okay.
Here are the roads we agreed with the council that need to be closed to traffic for the duration of the pour, which is from 5:25 a.m. to midday.
Yeah, okay, go.
The Vale up to Parklands Farm Road.
So it is cider that you're drinking?
Eat something.
Fuck!
It's round the baby's neck like a noose.
They let me use my phone for one minute.
- When will you get here?
- About 45 minutes.
Sorry, you're not a theater man.
And not a reader of books and not a talker.
It's funny it was someone like you, someone so opposite to me.
All the things I love mean absolutely zero to you.
The important thing is to get the baby out.
Well, the news is, they're resorting to knives.
Well, by the sound of you, they're giving you gas, are they?
Yeah, they think they might have to cut me open because I'm too old to push.
They're taking blood.
Well, just do what they say.
And someone keeps opening the window.
Tell them you're cold.
They said the umbilical cord is like a noose.
You think this is all fate, don't you, Dad?
Your dirty fucking fingerprints all over me.
You thought it was bound to happen because of the little seeds that you planted.
You never knew that because you never lifted a finger, you fucking lazy cunt.
I could come for you with a pick and a shovel, I really could, and dig you up and it would be a happy day in hell because they would be rid of you for a bit.
They make 500 a day just shoveling shit, shoveling shit about like you.
So, how can that be the difference between good and bad?
Come on.
I was wondering if anyone had called you about road closures.
One minute.
- Well, it's too late.
- I'm sorry?
We have to control the road to get the trucks in and out of the south gate.
That's right, but I can't ratify until the council sign off on the stop and go.
Ivan, we have a problem with the stop and go.
Okay, but if this is just to stop me drinking, you can fuck right off.
Listen, I'm hoping your conscience will stop you drinking.
- Hello?
- Sean, it's Dad.
There's been a cock-up at work and I need to speak to someone.
Dad, is Mum all right?
Sean, in the morning I will talk to you about everything, okay?
Now, you just get me the number of Cassidy, please.
- This is Ivan Locke.
- I am the father.
Mr. Locke, I'm sorry, we have a situation here where the baby's umbilical cord is wrapped around the baby's neck.
Yes, that's right, but Miss Maguire says she wants to wait until you are here.
It doesn't matter if I'm not there for the moment of the birth because I will still be there in the morning, before morning, in fact, and it will still be the same clay.
Fuck you!
I told them I love you, even if it was just once.
Well, there's no need to say that.
- And it'll be ours.
- Yes.
How far away are you?
Okay, then.
But I can be there as fast as the traffic will allow.
Ivan, I just found Sean looking through your pockets.
- He said you asked him for a phone number.
You leave concrete behind you everywhere.
Katrina, I love you.
I don't feel anything for this woman, and I'm trying to do the right thing tonight, because she is on her own and the baby is my fault.
And I know how it feels to be coming out into the world like this.
There is someone being brought into the world and it's my fault.
I really want to know that tomorrow I can drive home and talk to the boys and be at home as normal, and we can go out or something and have a drink and talk about it.
I want to know that I am not driving in one direction...
I want to know that I will be driving back when the sun comes up.
Ivan, let me ask you a question.
Do you still want me to give you the phone number so you can close the road?
Yes.
Right, well, goodbye, Ivan.
I found the mobile number for the council guy who signs off the closures.
Okay, okay, Okay 07700-900...
- 900957. -07700-900.
957.
- Mr. Cassidy?
- How did you get this number?
- Yeah, well, it's not Christmas.
- Yes, but I need a sign-off.
Okay, if I give you the number of the duty officer at the Belmount Police Station...
The only construction director who gave us paperwork ahead of time.
Okay, okay, Okay-
- Give me the bloody number.
You know, I could have easily let the concrete go to hell, but I didn't.
You know, Dad, when you came creeping back, saying you were sorry, it was even worse than staying away.
And the fact that I could have done it was worse than anything, you know?
Because you were so fucking weak.
All the things I fucking despise inside one fucking stupid green shirt.
You looked pathetic.
You don't drink anymore and you don't fucking smoke dope.
It's those mavericks from up north we put in there at the last minute.
- Right, call the Albanian.
- Could you call in your sons?
So, do I have to drive down there?
Can I not just ring them?
They'll be knocking off and going home in, like, half an hour.
Okay, Ivan, I'm gonna be straight with you.
If I get stopped again, I go inside.
And I can't do that.
Okay, then you run.
So if you run, you'll get there before they get in their van.
Go, or my building won't get built.
You can run like the fucking wind.
So I'm gonna get out of my boots and put on my trainers?
No, you do it for the piece of sky we are stealing with our building.
You really have gone fucking mad, right?
You see, you take things in your own hands, and you push against it and you push against it until it's upright.
And you stick to the plan.
Bethan, it's me.
I know they're operating on you right now, but I just wanted to say good luck.
And you deserve to be happy.
You see?
Life.
Yes, life sentence.
So what?
I will do what needs to be done, even if they hate me or love me.
You have to be solid so that it makes no difference what they think.
- What was the score?
- 3-1.
Good.
Caldwell, Robinson and Caldwell again.
Good.
No.
Yes, well, something's happened.
I'll explain when I'm not driving.
She's upstairs.
I've only just explained it to myself.
Are you coming home?
Where else would I go?
Look, when I get to the other end, I'll call.
Sean, you tell Eddie that it's okay, that I'll make it okay, okay?
I'll fix it and it'll all go back to normal.
- Now, you should go to bed.
- Third goal was amazing.
You know, I nearly got fucking run down by a taxi there, running.
- The bitumen, it's getting in my throat.
- His name is Stefan, Donal.
Give them 500 each.
Jesus, my heart's coming out...
All 12 pumps will work.
The stop-go will run.
The north, south, east and west gates will all take their quarter of concrete.
The baby will be born.
And Katrina will be okay.
In the morning she will be okay.
The Lockes were a long line of shit, but I straightened the name out.
Yeah?
And they said 600, right, so I guess you're gonna say yeah?
- Yes.
- Yeah, good, okay.
This guy Stefan, he doesn't say much, does he?
You'll be okay now, Donal.
Jesus, I'm stone-cold sober now.
He says to say you're the best man in England.
-Yes.I've decided.
This is not your home anymore and I want you to stay away.
Katrina, please, listen.
You were always more in love with your buildings anyway.
Hey, I'm gonna wash everything here, wash it all out 10 times to get the dust of you out of it.
I won't have to deal with your footprints turning to stone on the kitchen floor anymore.
Ivan, I've put a construction director onto this.
He's tried to reach Donal 100 times, but Donal isn't picking up.
Are you there, Ivan?
Ivan, for fuck's sake, I can't do this.
Everything is taken care of and everything is ready for 5:25.
- There will be no mistakes.
- You have a call waiting.
I have made sure of everything and I've made sure everything is in place.
Well, hear this, Gareth.
I just have myself and the car that I'm in.
And I'm just driving and that's it.
Ivan, you fucked up your life, that's your business, but Chicago is going insane.
Two words I learned tonight.
Fuck Chicago.
Caldwell got it in and he controlled it, you know?
You know how you shout at him because it always flies off into the crowd?
And we thought he was gonna boot it over the bar again, but he didn't.
This is Caldwell, Dad, the one you say is always a donkey.
He went round the goalie and put it in.
Mum was crying, so she didn't even see it.
But we recorded it for you, so you have to come home and watch it, okay?
You have to come home, and I have an idea, okay?
So, we'll pretend we don't know the score and pretend it's happening then, pretend it's live.
Good night, Dad.
Ls everything okay?
Listen.
Ivan, will you come?
Now that Conrad's running for governor, he'll be forced to vacate his seat on Grayson Global's board, which means that you can get closer to Daniel.
Look, we make one hell of a team.
You deal me back in, and I swear, the sky's the limit.
Did you know about her plan for the Graysons?
Jack, I am so sorry about everything.
Hoping I could come by and visit you next week, talk about finding a way to honor Amanda.
My door is always open.
The Amanda Clarke I knew was a survivor.
Who are you?
To carry a secret is to play with fire.
Try to pass it on, and you risk hurting someone else.
Are you certain that nobody knows about this place?
Not a chance.
This is our safe haven.
I can imagine the depths that solitude brought you to.
I wasn't alone, Aiden.
My foster brother showed up.
Have you any reason to think he may wish you ill?
I burned down our house.
Why do you always draw the same thing?
So I never forget what my father did.
Where's Amanda?
Mom, this idea for a foundation in Amanda's name, it's such an amazing way to honor her.
See you, sweetheart.
Oh, good morning, Daniel.
How did you sleep?
The success of their schemes lies in keeping the pieces disparate so as to prevent anyone from connecting the dots.
Have you forgotten his pursuit of Emily?
And he was instrumental in my ousting at the company, was he not?
I know ruining lives is in your D.N.A., but I'm not allowing another innocent person to pay the price for our sins.
I wish that I could expedite the claim on your wife's policy, but I'm afraid it won't be fully processed until the criminal investigation is closed.
I'll draw up the paperwork and I'll give you a call.
I'm still trying to figure out why Nolan told me you two had checked in to the hotel in Nantucket.
He said that?
I know how difficult this time is for you right now, so please allow me to be brief.
And we asked ourselves how we could keep Amanda alive in more than just our hearts.
So we arrived at this idea of creating a foundation in her name.
In light of Amanda's difficult childhood, we thought our goal could be a better tomorrow by promoting and protecting the well-being of children today.
We could call it the Amanda Clarke Foundation or the Amanda Porter Foundation if you like.
Amanda Clarke's more appropriate.
Then can I say we have your blessing?
What a wonderful idea.
That's very generous.
He says he's Amanda Clarke's brother.
Foster brother to be specific.
Your daughter Charlotte invited me.
Unfortunately, without enough lead time to make the funeral.
Well, it was a lovely ceremony.
I'm sure Amanda would've appreciated the fact that you did everything you could to be there.
Mr. James, Emily Thorne.
She looks happy.
How long are you in town for, Mr. James?
I hadn't put a clock on it.
I was on my way back from business in London when I heard the news.
Well, what line of business are you in?
Well, if your schedule allows, we would love for you to be an honored guest at the inaugural benefit in your sister's name.
She's putting together a foundation in honor of Amanda.
I wanted to say thank you for inviting me.
Oh, I'm afraid my daughter's still at school.
But I'm sure Amanda's husband would love to meet you, and I can give you directions to his tavern.
Perfect.
Well, you think we could be dealing with another Tyler?
So long as Padma's in a holding pattern with the Initiative, it'll be a welcome distraction.
- Where are you going?
- I have to talk to Jack before Eli does.
Well, I thought Jack wasn't talking to you.
You do know that guilt is a bottom-feeder?
It can't be drowned in your afternoon tumbler.
Oh, I'm sorry if I can't reconcile the taking of a life as easily as you.
The name "Amanda Clarke" keeps ringing my ears.
Well, then we have something in common.
But where you let it consume you, your mother and I have chosen to resurrect her.
Oh, by slapping her name on a charity.
If I recall, you did the exact same thing when you created the Victims United Fund after the crash of Flight 197.
Well, it's a bit of good born of tragedy.
And which did, by the way, help me sleep a little better.
Hopefully a similar gesture will do the same for you.
And what exactly is in my future, the Aiden Mathis Fund?
The head of the Charles.
Twenty meters to go with your scull two lengths behind, and you drew on your God-given strength to win.
Seeing you awarded this medal was one of my proudest moments.
Thanks for the walk down memory lane.
We do what we do not for ourselves, but for something beyond ourselves...
Me for the family I already had, and you for the family I'd like to imagine is in your future.
Daniel, I...
Quite well, Mr. Mathis, as do you, I understand.
Daniel was just telling me his plan to nominate you as my successor to the board.
Yes, well, your endorsement would mean a great deal.
I don't see why I shouldn't.
Well, thank you very much.
Uh, Daniel, if you'd like to grab a drink after work, there's some acquisition proposals I'd like to run by you.
Sounds great.
What can I do for you?
When you and Amanda were in juvie, what was the opinion she had of her father?
- He said that to you?
- Among other things.
Now if that's true, why would Amanda risk everything trying to prove that the Graysons had David Clarke framed?
Guy has got the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Not at all the, uh, footloose dock boy you told me about.
That's a nice tattoo.
You're lookin' pretty good for a dead girl.
You really fell off the map after you did your time.
I mean, I spent years trying to track you down, but all I found was a stripper passing herself off as you.
What's the con?
That doesn't seem like an even trade to me.
I mean, you got money and shed the name, but the stripper gets a broke-ass boyfriend and a one-way ticket to the bottom of the Atlantic?
I already told you.
Your illegitimate sister invited me.
If it's money that you want, I've got plenty of it.
Everyone says you set that fire at your last house on purpose.
People believe what they want to believe.
Amanda, get back up here.
The Petersen family wants a second look.
And it seems like you have, too.
Antique books?
That's just a scam I run on dumb rich people.
Eli, these people might be rich, but they're not dumb.
Eventually, they're gonna figure you out.
Well, I can't have that.
I've already got outstanding warrants in three states.
What if I told you that I had a way to wipe your record clean?
You can make that happen?
I'll even provide the means for you to start over.
You just have to do it somewhere else.
Well, if it ain't Danny Grayson, king of the world.
I actually got my M.B.A.
Hey, not now, pal.
What the hell are you doing?
Now you want to be my guardian angel?
I was protecting your best interests.
Yeah, well, maybe you should start protecting your own.
You think you want my life?
I think that would be a great idea.
Your timing couldn't be better.
Well, timing, as they say, is everything.
In the corner to your left.
- Help you?
- My name's Jack Porter.
The police said an ambulance picked me up from this slip over Labor Day weekend.
You the guy from that boat fire?
Yeah.
Sorry to hear about your wife.
Do you have any idea what that's like?
Look, I'm just trying to get some answers here.
Somebody pulled me onto these docks and saved my life.
If it wasn't you, just tell me who it was.
Later that night, he called again.
Tall, sandy hair, blue eyes...
That's all I remember, kid.
You told me plenty.
Victoria.
I can think of a few things.
So you found another candidate?
Well, I am considering my options.
Not exactly a face that screams "extortion" and "embezzlement," is it?
Hey there, Emily, right?
Eli, this is Nolan.
He's assisting in what we discussed.
Got it.
That's quite the criminal record.
Now will you go?
Well, I'll have to make sure he does.
Declan is Amanda's brother-in-law.
She was nice enough to show me around the island today.
So that's where your day went?
There are a few people I wanted to introduce Eli to.
Only Ashley Davenport can whip together such an elegant gala so quickly.
I wanted to return the favor before anybody else gets hurt.
Amanda's foster brother?
Amanda told me that a couple of years ago, he looked her up at the club she was working at.
He was in trouble with some people.
He needed some money.
If I were the Graysons, I wouldn't be comfortable with him under this roof.
And on the prowl, by the looks of it.
Well, maybe I could take a few pointers on wooing Grayson offspring.
Daniel still hasn't spoken to me since his meltdown in midtown.
Does he know that his father intervened?
No, but I have a feeling I'm about to find out.
No, it's too risky.
He'll question my motives from the moment I knock on his door.
Well, perhaps I can lead him to yours.
Because all all I can see is the sheep.
If he and Amanda were, in fact, estranged, then why is he here?
What does he want?
I'm just relieved he's not allied with that poor lost soul.
Who told you this anyway?
I can handle anyone who operates in subterfuge, present company included.
But I do know someone you can talk to.
I just thought you should know.
And if there's anyone who can help you through whatever it is you're suffering, then we both know she's a good listener.
Did she put you up to this?
'Cause I imagine it's how you scored your invite tonight.
It was your father who summoned me.
Regardless of what you're gonna donate, it's gonna be, I don't know, half of it's...
Can I have a word?
Well, I certainly hope this word is worth 100 grand, because that's about the size of the donation you just scared off.
Yeah, I hope your explanation's worth twice that, 'cause I'm gonna take you out right here in front of everyone.
Oh, variations on the theme you set at happy hour.
Aiden Mathis just told me you appointed him treasurer of the foundation.
What the hell are you doing?
What you don't have the brass to do.
Well, this time, I'm intent on keeping our assets out of the government's reach.
Yeah, well, and here I thought you were just doing this for your conscience.
Listen to me.
When the Initiative inevitably lowers its hammer, it needs to appear that Mr. Mathis not only assisted in the plot but has also taken off with our money.
We will be safe legally and financially.
I'm gonna go over there.
She was amazing, wasn't she?
She was.
Amanda told me that she felt so much guilt for what she did, starting that fire.
You must blame her to some degree.
What is this about?
Too old, too jaded.
It wasn't easy, especially for Amanda.
She was a troubled girl.
Well, who's to judge?
After the hand life dealt her, whose daughter she was...
And yet, here you are, a shining example of a child who persevered, from a foster home to Columbia University.
Well, in the face of tragedy, I count myself lucky.
After the fire, I went on to a better home, a family who adopted me and gave me a real education.
In honor of Amanda, and all of the... invisible children.
And the Graysons are among them.
Thank you all for being here.
We applaud your bravery, Mr. Porter.
Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight and for helping us launch the Amanda Clarke Foundation...
Jack, what are you doing here?
Lying through my teeth like you and Emily.
I found the guy that you bought the Rose Gray from.
- What the hell's the Rose Gray?
You were there the night Amanda died.
Okay, Jack, listen, I...
No, no, no, no.
I'm done listening to you.
If you or Emily were my real friends, you would've told me the truth in the beginning.
And you wouldn't be here rubbing elbows with the people responsible for her death, the very people she came here to destroy.
What was that about?
Uh, nothing I can't handle.
You've got your hands full right now.
...Far reaching, not to mention vigorous and bold, which is why I simply can't imagine a better soul to join me as co-chair than Eli James.
Come up here, Eli.
Mrs. Grayson.
I thought we had a deal.
So did I, until I overheard Victoria's little sidekick relaying your warning against me.
Can I talk to you?
Yeah, I was just on my way home, actually.
Actually, he just left with your neighbor.
Emily Thorne?
That's the one.
What are you doin'?
Pervert.
She sure made a beautiful bride.
Get outta here, Nolan.
Get out before I call the police.
Because I would tell them the same thing that I'm about to tell you.
As much as I'd like to take credit for saving your life the other night, that's not what happened out there.
What is this?
A copy of the title to the speedboat formerly known as the Rose Gray.
Now currently renamed and registered to one Kenneth Ryan.
Look, if you don't believe my hacking skills, go to the DMV yourself tomorrow.
Kenny was driving that boat?
Well, that's what the state record says.
I mean, I guess it makes sense, considering no one came forward to say they saved your life.
Wouldn't be the first time that the Ryan brothers teamed up against you.
Though maybe Kenny had a crisis of conscience?
I gotta find him.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
I shouldn't be telling you this.
Telling me what, Daniel?
What is going on?
You probably won't believe it anyway.
And here we are.
This house is the perfect spot for this.
No one knew better than David Clarke what I'm going through right now.
I can hardly breathe, and I can't get out of it without putting it around someone else's.
Even if it means that person will suffer the fate that they had planned for me?
All I care about is you.
Do your parents know about this?
Know about this?
That's the whole reason for this party tonight.
They're hiding their money in this foundation in case there's an investigation and their assets are frozen.
- Are you kidding me?
Then I guess I should cancel my check.
No, don't, please.
They'll suspect I told you something.
And the king sat in his counting room counting all his money.
While the queen was in the parlor eating bread and boozing.
The question is, what is it he's expecting to buy?
Did we raise enough money to form a legitimate charity?
Just shy of $5 million.
No one can accuse you of being an underachiever, my dear.
So have you come to berate me again for my wayward ways?
Oh, believe it or not, I'm right there with you.
Make sure the treasurer knows it's tax-deductible.
Well, thank God he's found the fortitude to get through this.
If he is cozying up to someone, you can bet Trask will know about it.
Well, then maybe he can help solve one of our problems.
Well, better.
I have him convinced that Kenny Ryan bought that speedboat.
Good.
It's marvelous, really.
But, uh, I know you didn't call to sweet-talk technology.
The Graysons are planning to move their entire fortune into the Amanda Clarke Foundation.
That is quite an achilles you've discovered.
And tomorrow we sever it.
So how do I look?
Like someone about to go to a board induction, hopefully?
I would say that you look the part of both board member of a corrupt company and treasurer for a bogus charity.
Well, the latter position may not last too long, as Conrad has me as treasurer of a Swiss account for which I seem to have lost the routing information.
Assuming that Nolan's software works as well as he claims it does.
So what are you gonna do about Eli?
Nothing for now.
Aiden Mathis.
He's not only capable of helping steer this company, but he's got your back in bar fight, too.
She's a silent killer.
Why do you think I'm so anxious about who gets their hands on her?
Watch and be amazed.
Let me access the mainframe's code, see what's tripping us up.
This can't be.
Well, at first I didn't know who until I started searching the log files.
"The Falcon."
He's a hacker legend.
At one point, I aspired to be him.
Enough, Nolan.
But, David, this is the lead that we have been searching for.
It's worse than the last one.
She's looking at least three years in juvie.
You need to forget about me and focus on her.
She's the only thing that matters anymore.
You can't let her end up in a place like this, Nolan.
I am trusting you to make sure that she lives long enough to have a future, Nolan.
Whoever wrote the code protecting this bank account is the same person that sealed your father's fate.
I could cry thinking about that sweet black ass of hers.
I got a video of me doing something I shouldn't have been.
Can I get some fucking privacy?
Eddie just picked your father out of the line-up.
What's Daryll doing here?
We're all going to Palm Springs.
Palm Springs?
Why are you all dressed up?
I'll bring the Donovan family over to Bel Air Academy.
Can we do this later, please?
I'm all dressed.
How do you get these freaking things undone?
Great kids come from great fucks.
- So I come from a great fuck, huh?
- Absolutely.
And what about me, Pop?
You quit school to make that shit?
It's shit.
- You're gonna break it.
Mickey's going out of town with Daryll and Bunchy.
- Call me later.
- I will, boss.
Who let you in here?
He's named after Marvin Gaye.
Who's that?
Just the greatest RB singer ever.
God, Mom, gross.
I was making a joke.
You can't keep skipping out on your dues.
How many fucking times your grandma die?
That last one was my step-grandma, bro.
You're in a mood.
We barely break even.
You let every kid come in here scam you.
They sign the deal, we get a piece of the action.
- What you cooking for this lady, man?
But she told me she likes spaghetti.
Can't get pussy from shit from a jar.
You gotta make it from scratch.
Fuck all, who raised you anyway?
Well, this is it.
What the fuck kind of architecture is this?
My mom's new husband used to produce movies back in the '80s.
He still hangs out with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell sometimes.
Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn?
You need to let me know when you leave town, Mickey.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Daryll.
You must be Mickey.
Thank you, Mickey.
I wanted to thank you for taking care of Daryll while I was in the joint.
Mickey.
It's nice of you to say that.
Black don't crack.
I'm not working today, Stu.
- What did he want?
- Relationship advice.
Here at Bel Air Academy on a daily basis, we dwell in possibility.
What's going on, Avi?
- Yeah, they're in Palm Springs.
- What the fuck are they doing there?
I need him back in L.A. for the warrant.
Well, what if he doesn't come back to L.A?
- We need him back in L.A., Av.
I've been saving this bottle of cognac for years.
1946.
Very rare.
How much did a bottle like that set you back?
I know the saying.
Though he doesn't act it.
Little dude, what's up?
- Nope, not yet, but I'm gonna.
- My dad produces his movies.
Says he's a degenerate homo.
So if Tommy wants to hang out with you he's just trying to get into your pants.
It's an easier sell before we move on to the histories.
We start with the English histories, we do Richard II and Henry V.
If that doesn't kill them, we're gonna move on to the Roman histories next.
We're gonna have Coriolanus, Julius Caesar.
Okay, boss, you tell me.
- Yeah, it's good.
Time.
Jesus, Bunch.
- You got my fucking hair wet.
"So what?" I got product in it and I told you that.
What's your problem?
You motherfucker!
Cut it out, man.
So you're a movie producer, huh?
If you ever need a great idea, I got one.
Just need someone to spill it out to.
What's it about?
It's about some guy who did 20 years for no good fucking reason.
I heard about that, Mick.
Claudette and I have no secrets from each other.
You know the "if," Mick.
You two having a good time?
Ray's family.
They're beautiful.
Come on, Ray.
Turn it off.
My mom says you're gonna lead me down the wrong path.
Everything's gotta be over my sweater.
I can do that.
So you bringing your kids around here to run errands too?
Pick up the trays after lunch, extort lunch money from other kids?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
You don't talk to my husband like that.
Doesn't work like that around here, Ray.
You can't just threaten people get what you want.
I'll be right back.
My therapist said I should apologise to you.
Your therapist?
A beautiful young girl.
Thank you for your apology.
You're welcome.
- How long ago did this happen?
Want me to call Ezra?
Yeah, that's a microphone.
This whole room is wired?
How do you know where everything is?
Can I see your ID?
What the fuck you doing, man?
Fucking scumbag.
Do you ever think about the things that you do?
We have a $10-million scholarship fund for students who can prove need.
You kept it.
Here's your other beautiful black baby.
Let's see if it's alive.
And more.
Oh, well, what are you gonna do?
You like what you like.
I did what had to be done.
Mick, things have changed.
You like this guy?
He's good to you?
All right, then.
Gonna play for the soccer team if you come here?
That's Tommy Wheeler sucking on your dick.
That fucking kid hit me.
Did you fucking see that?
Get back here, you fucking asshole.
Ezra he fucked me so badly on my divorce.
- You like this place, don't you?
Whatever you say.
One of those Bel Air cougars.
What the fuck, Ray?
Walk away.
Don't show your face here again, bitch.
Where's the fucking waiter?
I need a new drink.
"Cost me $2000 back in '95.
And if you have to ask me how much it costs today you can't afford it." - "You can't afford it."
I gotta go take a piss.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you going?
You gotta let me know when you leave town, Mickey.
You gotta stop hanging around in men's rooms unless you wanna give the wrong impression.
You need to cooperate.
Like I said, go fuck yourself and give me more money.
First thing you do when you get out is kill a priest.
I can take care of it but you got to work with me.
What do you want from me?
I want them all, Mickey.
All of them.
Ezra Goldman, Lee Drexler and your boy Ray.
What the hell happened to your face?
Nothing.
Dad is Tommy Wheeler really a pervert?
Sorry about the smell.
There's a lot of men in here.
It doesn't bother me.
It's delicious.
Where did you learn how to cook like this?
All right, Pie, that's enough.
For chrissake, get a chair.
I hope you don't mind.
Potato Pie, this is Frances.
Frances I didn't make the food.
Nice to meet you.
Terry really likes you.
See, when I was a kid, I really liked pie.
I mean, who doesn't?
But I liked the hell out of pie.
Well, cheers.
It's delicious.
Well, I'm glad you like it.
Mick, that's a...
- I'm going in.
Are you hungry?
Who can tell me why we're having movie day?
Uh, you wanted to show us how you spent your summer vacation?
I showed those clips to pose, one of the most fundamental questions we'll explore this semester.
What is an abnormal brain?
And how does having one affect behavior?
Some abnormalities are structural, so they show up on a brain scan or an autopsy, but others are sneakier and more insidious.
They're Neurochemical in nature, so we don't always know they're there.
Like it or not, we are stuck with the three pounds of cauliflower we were born with.
Hot-guy alert.
You look great, Kate.
Okay, well, um, I think I'm gonna... go.
Only now, it turns out I need your help.
You always want something, don't you, Donnie?
Word in the building is you know the perfect guy.
- Have you been working out?
Did hell freeze over and I missed it?
Paul, are you on peyote?
That was 25 years ago.
Bad memories, every time I smell garlic I think of Olga.
But you've been on your meds for nine months now, and you're looking good.
Not gonna happen, Coach.
Now, if you will excuse me, I have an appointment.
For doing what, exactly?
Apparently, his first attorney never requested a competency hearing.
And you want me to determine if he's mentally fit to stand trial a second time.
I'm the FBI liaison to the assistant U.S. Attorney who's handling the case.
We want you to evaluate Flynn and be the government's expert witness.
Well, hopefully you can contain your excitement, because we can't get in to see Flynn until tomorrow.
But I was wondering if you just felt like getting a cup of tea, catching up.
It's been a while.
Oh, the things I could have done with that hour of my life.
You're gonna have to fill me in.
Oh, come on, Daniel you know what I mean.
I was your psychiatrist.
You haven't been my psychiatrist for months, we agreed to be friends.
But maybe that was a mistake.
I have never been clearer in my life.
You are Caroline Newsome.
You grew up in Grosse Pointe.
You're a brilliant diagnostician with a soft spot for stray animals, but you can't have pets because you're allergic.
You hate Cilantro, you're impatient with cab drivers, and you smell like lavender.
I am falling for you, Caroline, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same.
And where have you been all night?
Okay, but I was worried sick, Doc.
The least you could have done is call.
You got laid.
I beg your pardon?
Do you know why I'm here?
What day of the week is it?
Uh, it's Thursday.
Can you name all the cities you've ever lived in?
I grew up in Chicago, and I was in Lexington...
In a trial, do you know what a prosecutor's job is?
Yeah, try and put criminals like me in jail.
So after you got shot?
Yeah, I guess so.
- If I don't need it, then, sure, why not?
I never had eggplant.
Well, imagine you that you had and you really couldn't stand the taste.
Billy, do you know why you're on trial?
Why did you do it?
Because I was angry, I guess, because... because she left, you know?
What the hell was all that eggplant crap?
You know what a bureaucratic nightmare that is, Kate.
I'd have to file a writ of temporary release, get an escort.
- Yes, he's that Donnie.
It seemed pretty clear to me in the first two minutes that the guy is competent.
Hell, he's downright articulate.
Billy Flynn gave himself a Prefrontal Lobotomy.
- Well, then we're good.
Yes, but you're missing the point.
No, the only issue here is whether Flynn is competent to stand trial, and you've just confirmed that he is, so thank you.
Hey, I didn't want to testify in your little show trial in the first place.
He could put all of his conclusions in his report, and I'll file it with the court.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a trial to prepare for.
Don't you have to turn that over to the defense?
Oh, I'm turning it over.
Along with the rest of Flynn's medical history, and all the other evidence we've collected over the last five years.
You're always working an angle, aren't you, Donnie?
I know you're still pissed at me, and I don't blame you.
But since we're gonna be working together now, the least we could do is try to be civil.
I have an idea.
I can't believe how good this is.
Did you just imply that you and I are having bad "pizza"?
Well, I'm just so damn happy, which, frankly, I find annoying.
You're annoyed that you're happy?
- We've been together in public before.
No, of course not.
I'm a shrink involved with a former patient.
What if I ran into a colleague?
I'm fine.
I much prefer pizza in bed.
Mrs. Flynn had multiple burn marks, and lacerations on her arms, legs, and upper leg area.
She also sustained multiple skull fractures as a result of blunt-force trauma to the back of her head.
Your witness, Mr. Bauer.
Oh, uh, no questions, your honor.
And is the person that you witnessed, threatening the victim in the courtroom today?
Let the record reflect that the witness is pointing at the defendant.
No further questions.
No questions, your honor.
Chairman, Road Ragers benevolent riding association.
Is Billy Flynn also a member of the Road Ragers?
And did Mr. Flynn have a reputation for following through on his threats?
What Billy had a reputation for was being mean.
He'd boot stomp you just to watch your expression change.
No more questions.
Let me guess.
No questions, your honor.
You do realize that this is the London Phil's only performance in The United States this year?
I know, but my... my circumstances have changed.
Congratulations.
- What are you talking about?
- The defense must have done it.
That sneaky bastard.
He's gonna use it as a last-ditch attempt to try and resurrect an insanity defense.
Or he's just hoping to use it to soften up the jury for sentencing.
Either way, you better not screw up my case.
And what specialized education did you receive to earn that title?
The government stipulates as to Dr. Pierce's credentials.
He's our expert, for God's sake.
You can move on.
Do you recognize this document?
This is my competency evaluation of Billy Flynn.
Dr. Pierce, would you please read the highlighted portion?
This is ludicrous.
Your honor, the government's own expert, believes that the defendant is not the same man he used to be.
Now, I intend to call witnesses who can describe him before he was shot.
And then I will call people who know him now, and they will all testify that he is, indeed, a fundamentally different person.
It's a question for the jury.
You can't seriously be considering this.
So I'm inclined to give Mr. Bauer a little leeway.
When was the first time that you met Billy Flynn?
That he kicked Gypsy's head in because her barking woke him up.
Always getting into fights with guards, inmates.
And what about this time, after he shot himself and was subsequently convicted of murder?
- What's he like now?
Well, then why are you snitching on Billy Flynn right now?
Because Billy broke the code first when he testified against me.
Are you referring to Mr. Flynn's testimony three years ago?
That's correct.
And whatever deal that son of a bitch made better have been worth it because now he's fair game.
Keep it clean, Mr. Hill.
Would it surprise you to learn that Billy Flynn received absolutely no special treatment in exchange for his testimony against you and the other Road Ragers?
Now, I ask you, does that sound to you like the actions of a violent criminal?
Tell me about your sister.
Amy was such a beautiful person.
Her life was full of so much promise until she met Billy.
And what happened when Amy left Billy?
He gathered up her belongings and set them on fire.
And then he tracked her down and dragged her back.
And when she tried to escape?
He strangled her to death.
Afterwards, I went to their place to see if I could, salvage anything of Amy's, you know, just to remember her by.
She was so happy that day.
Now that picture is all I have left of my baby sister.
So, I take it you believe that Billy Flynn should be found guilty and executed?
No.
And why is that, Mr. Kendricks?
After Billy was granted an appeal, I went to see him.
I wanted to look him in the eye, and let him know that I hadn't forgiven him for what he'd done to Amy.
He asked me how my garden was doing.
I grow tomatoes.
I knew, in that moment, that he wasn't the same monster that had killed my sister.
He was a different man.
Your crazy Professor screwed us.
You don't think Flynn could actually walk, do you?
Have you been watching the jury?
They seemed pretty moved by the testimony.
And juries are prone to doing crazy things.
So, what are you gonna do?
The government recalls Dr. Daniel Pierce.
I remind you you're still under oath, Dr. Pierce.
You may answer the question, Dr. Pierce.
I take medication to control my symptoms.
- So, then you experience delusions?
Over coffee or maybe a little pillow talk?
You think I told Donnie?
Okay, if you think that I would ever betray your trust like that, you obviously don't know me as well as I thought you did.
I should never have blamed Kate.
The question is, why were you so upset in the first place?
You're not my shrink anymore.
Maybe people are more enlightened and accepting than you give them credit for.
Oh, I just gave my professional opinion.
Maybe, but if it wasn't for you, I'd be facing the electric chair.
So, what are you gonna do now that you're a free man?
You could take some art classes.
I just got my ride back.
The only plans I got is to tear up some asphalt and raise a little hell.
You were all so gullible.
See you around, Doc.
He's dead.
A couple weeks ago, I started to notice that my hand was shaking.
It's rare with the new class of drugs, but if you don't stop it, it could become permanent.
Does Dr. Newsome know you've been messing with your meds?
So can we just... can we stop talking about me, please, and start talking about the case?
They match casings from a shooting at a bar in Naperville six years ago.
Anyway, I was on my way to go talk to him when, uh, you showed up.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Daniel, are you sure that that's a good idea?
Besides, now that you know everything, you can keep an eye on me.
Now, can we please get the hell out of here?
Yeah, it's that damn motorcycle.
You saw a motorcycle?
I didn't hear anything.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
I made one mistake six years ago, and I've been looking over my shoulder ever since.
Joe, if you'll talk to the U.S. Attorney, if you agree to testify, he can get you into Witness Protection, okay?
You can stop looking over your shoulder.
And then I heard a gunshot, and I felt blood running down my leg.
Most of them took off at that point, but one guy hung back.
He said now I'd learn what happens when I mess with a Road Ragers girl.
And what happens to snitches is even worse, so if I had any ideas about going to the cops, just forget about it.
Do you recognize the man who threatened you?
Classic indicators of narcissistic personality disorder.
We have a witness who connects you to a shooting behind a bar in Naperville six years ago.
The same .45 used in that incident was used to kill Billy Flynn.
That ties you to the gun, which is more than enough for me to charge you with Billy's murder.
Now I suppose you're gonna try to convince us that Billy used that same .45 to shoot himself after he was released from prison.
I mean, my mind was changed completely, which isn't an easy thing to do.
I mean, it's not like Frankenstein.
But... but I know who did.
No, we're here because we know who killed him.
You never really changed your mind about Billy Flynn, did you, Charlie?
That's where you found that charred photo of her, but you found something else, didn't you?
We took tire-tread impressions near the scene.
What did you do, Charlie?
When I went to get her things, I found the gun.
Until that shyster, Ruben Bauer, showed up and got him a new trial.
He just kept saying how sorry he was, like that was gonna change my mind.
Then you showed up and testified how Billy had miraculously turned into this Saint.
You know, it made me want to puke.
Maybe the jury would spare his pathetic excuse of a life, and that was a chance I couldn't take.
So you went to the defense and offered to testify on Flynn's behalf.
You figured if the victim's own brother testified that Flynn had changed...
He'd get out, and I'd make sure he got the justice that he deserved.
You think Billy became a different person, Dr. Pierce?
When he killed my sister, I became a different person.
So Billy gets out, and Charlie goes in.
Ruben Bauer just agreed to represent him.
I wonder if he'll put up that "he's a different guy altogether" defense again.
I wonder if I could ever be a different guy altogether.
Because you wouldn't be my wing man, I had to invite Neumeier from engineering.
Total disaster, the man's irritable bowel was acting up, he got up three times to go to the bathroom for goodness' sakes, needless to say, the whole evening was ruined.
I'm asking you to set me up.
And did you tell him who you were dating?
Daniel, who are you talking to?
Can people really change?
Is our personality genetically pre-programmed?
Or is it malleable?
In essence, our experiences rewire us.
They can make us do or think things previously undoable or unthinkable.
They can provoke us into forming new thoughts and ideas.
And they can teach us valuable lessons, making us less inclined to repeat the mistakes of our past.
My father was an innocent man, destroyed by powerful people.
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
- You can't go in there!
I want to save you.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's never rained on a Grayson Memorial Day kickoff.
I'm not a Grayson yet, Daniel.
Then why don't we finally set a date to make you one?
Let's just get through tomorrow first, okay?
You know, I still can't believe you tried to engineer a family reunion.
Too bad only half my family's gonna be there.
But aren't you the slightest bit curious why we haven't heard from your mother these past six months?
Well, I can only hope after the way she left things with us, that she's in such a dark, lonely place, that we never hear from her again.
Something the matter?
I hope you understand that it's not a good idea for you to be staying here while Conrad returns.
You know, I would have been happy to have you join me in the city.
Well, apparently, we no longer own property in Paris, which I loved discovering at 3:00 A.M., after chartering a car from Brussels.
Darling, I'm sorry nobody told you, but the European market is very strong right now.
As is your stableboy, it seems.
I know the past few months have been very difficult for you, losing Declan and the baby, but I was hoping that graduating early and going to Europe would prove restorative.
We'll discuss it later.
We still own the manor, right?
Only took ten years to return the favor.
I was kinda hoping you'd have to repay this one never.
Well, I'm glad you're back among the living, Nolan.
Took a lot longer than expected for the fail-safe I invented in Carrion to ferret out all the Initiative numbers, exonerate me.
I'm doing my best to avoid setting a date while Daniel looks for a job.
- Jack was about to shoot Conrad?
Especially if this is your new summer pad.
Not mine.
If memory serves, I still owe you a house.
I guess sometimes payback's not a bitch.
Although I imagine it will be for New York's first and worst family.
What do you have on tap?
A long summer of fun.
Beginning with tomorrow's Memorial Day party?
And if everything goes as planned, that'll be the last one the Graysons ever attend.
Finally achieving the immortality you've always hoped for.
Oh, no, my legacy lies in the work I'm getting done.
It's a springboard both for the state's rehabilitation and my ascension to the higher offices to which I'm destined.
To make me head of your security detail?
I said, Dad, hedge funds aren't for me anymore, and neither are your connections.
It's time to make something of myself.
Well, as long as it isn't kickstarting a poetry review.
Oh, that'd be my chief of staff, who worked at Rice Hawthorne, by the way.
Scotty, what's the good word?
There are much nicer places to get a drink.
Some of them are even open.
Miles away from your penthouse and the venue of the party that you didn't invite me to.
Knowledge is power, Emily.
For what?
Everything you have.
I saw that look in your eye the night of the election.
That's not how it happened, Ashley.
And to be honest, you seem a little desperate.
I'll be at your party tomorrow, and you can introduce me to some men of standing.
I mess up one order when I'm 14, and you'll never let me live it down.
You seemed very happy with your orange juice.
Such a nice surprise to see you.
How long has it been?
Oh, well, since before you knew how to properly ask for a drink.
I've never understood how making money is a job description.
But of course, your kind are a necessary evil as I'm here to be ogled by yet another investor.
That could be 'cause you're not wearing a bra...
But you still noticed.
I hope you didn't cut your trip short just so you could make my Memorial Day party.
No, I'm home because my lovely mother has left me no other monetary option.
Have you seen her?
Seen her?
I think he's even staying at the house.
Beautiful.
Let's allow the past to remain so, shall we?
That's actually why I'm here.
I haven't received your R.S.V.P. for tomorrow.
Oh, well, I have little concern of what people think of me at the moment.
She told me you were having an affair.
And she's so desperate, she thought she'd blackmail me to protect your secret.
Well, suffice it to say, that her facts are as ill-conceived as her intentions.
Oh, of all people, you see right through me.
He's changed my heart.
I trust that you'll keep this information to yourself.
Then I trust I'll see you tomorrow.
I think both you and I understand the importance of protecting the sanctity of the family.
As much as we have to deal with those who won't.
Look, we can worry about that tomorrow.
Today, let's just relax and try to enjoy ourselves.
Not if our esteemed governor has anything to say about it.
He's amping security-- X-ray scanners, the whole nine.
Claims it's 'cause he's entertaining a presidential run.
Europe did wonders.
You would have loved it.
Why don't you tell your overworked dad your favorite moment?
And I was so proud, I turned to the stranger next to me and said, "that's my dad."
You can't imagine what it feels like to hear that.
You didn't tell me that we had a visitor.
So I imagine such anonymous contentment must seem odd to a man who has to service... 20 million people.
That's a timely change of heart.
May I presume that you'll also be representing my office in Binghamton for the transfer station opening next week?
Mm, baby steps, Conrad.
Especially after the inexcusable things you did while living here.
Yes, all in my endeavor to keep us alive-- a debt you can now repay by going to Binghamton.
To christen a landfill?
And what's that?
As of tomorrow, Grayson Manor is on the market.
Conrad's increased security at every entrance and for what I'm planning for the Graysons, let's just say, I have to bring it in with me.
Mm, so much for nesting.
I need you to hack this X-ray machine.
Cyber-revenging has brought me nothing but trouble.
So for now, I'm done with coding, camming, programming, and hacking.
I'm Nolan two point... no.
How?
I hope you don't mind if I let myself in.
My family is paying for this suite, after all.
What are you doing here?
Exactly what I was going to ask you.
Though I guess I know what you were doing at my house.
Charlotte, you don't understand.
And when I tell my father about you, he'll squash you like a bug.
Your father knows I exist.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Daniel and I go away for a couple of months, and my mother buys our replacement.
And I'm sorry you have such a low opinion of your mother.
Well, if you think you're just gonna enjoy the perks without the misery, you're wrong.
My mother will draw you in and destroy you.
You want a drink?
No, thanks.
I want a drink.
Where you been?
I was introducing my son to his extended family.
How is Carl?
He's good.
But you didn't.
I didn't know how I felt about you till this moment.
And obviously, you felt the same since you asked me to pop by.
Oh, it's just something I threw together for Emily's party this afternoon.
What's this?
Um, I can only consider myself a freelancer if I actually paint on occasion.
So, um, I'm going back home to the city.
So you're leaving me?
Or was that your plan all along?
Drawing me in, then abandon me as payback for my transgressions?
Did someone say something?
Can you believe it's been two years since we met?
Gosh, it feels like so much longer.
Can I get you something?
Well, people feel less like prisoners when they have the option to leave.
Trust me, I'm staying.
Dr. Velez.
- And you, too, Victoria?
Yeah, they'd all love to hear what you've been up to.
Trust me, I have very little of interest to say.
It doesn't look like Ashley has that problem.
I'm going to go look for Daniel.
Great to see you.
Huh, I didn't think you could pull it off, but the gang's all here.
Uh, Em, I'd like for you to meet Margaux Lemarchal.
A new magazine in the digital age?
Even with a strong brand behind it, it's not an easy prospect.
Which is why I'm doing it against Pascal's wishes.
I mean, besides throw lovely parties.
What the hell are you doing, Nolan?
Keep an eye on him.
You look piqued, Conrad.
I cannot suffer any more bad press due to that fool.
Today we unveil the portrait that will serve as a remembrance for all of the good that you've done for generations to come.
We, uh...
Maybe we should wait until we have something to say.
I'm afraid you have Huntington's Disease, Governor.
What is that?
It's a neurological disease where one slowly starts to lose motor skills and mental acuity.
It's progressive.
How... rapid is the onset?
Depends on the patient.
You need to consider your options.
Yeah, she's good.
I do hope your father will be okay.
You know, all was good for a while.
Now it's being torn away, and I just have to sit here and take it.
Well, sometimes forces beyond our control can change everything.
You're responsible for what happened to Conrad today, aren't you?
Isn't that exactly what you were stopping me from doing?
This is what they deserve.
Did Amanda get what she deserved?
Did Declan?
Well, one of your many misconceptions, Miss Davenport.
Emily told me about your pathetic attempt to blackmail her and your vendetta against our family.
I thought you might like to explain it yourself.
Well, Emily obviously didn't tell you the full story, like the fact that Jack Porter tried to assassinate your husband the night he got elected.
And who do you think gave him the gun?
Well, I also know that Conrad planted that bomb at Grayson Global and led Jack there to die.
With a text message sent from your phone.
I hope you didn't use your phone this time to sell Conrad's story to the media.
I did no such thing.
What you've done is try to sleep your way to the top after failing at a myriad of jobs we gave you out of pity.
Conrad's last act in office was to requisition your cell records that prove, in fact, that you attempted to lure Jack to his death.
Then let's get married before the end of the summer.
You got a date in mind?
How about August 8th?
What are you doing?
So are you gonna put Dad in Patrick's room?
How dare you, coming back here as if you run things?
You have no idea what you've done.
Don't worry, Victoria.
Neither of us is going anywhere.
Away from the prying eyes of Victoria on her cupola, where I could never do this.
What happens next?
When's the big date?
August 8th.
Toby gave it to "A," but Spencer already knew that.
I've got a key to sign in.
Come on, guys, let's go, 'cause we're breaking in to Wilden's apartment.
Look for letters, pictures, anything that might connect Wilden to Shana and Jenna.
If she doesn't find that key, we're gonna have a problem.
We can't afford for me not to be working.
I have to meet the insurance adjustor over there about 2:00, but look, before we do...
Yes, I understand it was a stolen car, but no sign of the driver?
I mean, if he was strung-out enough to drive straight into my living room, then how did he get away so fast?
Look, I know you're doing everything you can, mais cette voiture est entrée en collision avec ma maison
My daughter could've been sitting in that room.
Look, I'm just gonna call you back after I meet with the adjustor, okay?
How does someone just run away from an accident like that without one neighbor seeing him?
You better bring a jacket.
It's supposed to get cold tonight.
I'll come straight home after school to help you unpack.
Don't you have a college guidance session today?
Yeah, it was scheduled for this morning, but I figured... honey, don't miss that, please.
Mom, I wanna help you out.
You can help me by thinking about your future.
How are they?
"A" really likes throwing cars at people.
Is there any chance this really was an accident?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
No, okay, "A" did this, but why?
To keep us off balance, keep us from finding red coat, or Cece Drake, or whoever we're dealing with.
Well, I think it really was Cece, and I hope that Toby and Caleb find her.
God, Spence, what is taking your mom so long?
Courts run on judge-time, not lawyer-time.
She said that she would call you the minute that your mom was released.
Just take a breath, all right?
Mrs. Hastings, where's my mom?
No, I want them here.
But we're definitely going to appeal.
Okay, and how long is that gonna take?
The papers will be on the judge's desk this afternoon.
But some things have been put in motion.
What sort of things?
She's being remanded to the state prison in Muncy until the trial.
They'll move her tomorrow.
God, you promised.
I should be the one in jail, not my mom.
Hanna, you didn't do anything wrong.
Yeah, somebody killed Wilden and "A" is taking advantage of that.
It's not your fault.
My mom went out there to protect me, how is this not my fault?
Hanna, my mom is a really great lawyer.
Well, then why isn't my mom out?
Because it's just one hearing.
Are you sure?
I'm gonna have to see my dad.
If my mom doesn't come back, then I have to move in with him and the gruesome twosome.
Spence, tell your mom I'm sorry if I yelled at her.
A really good one.
No, I'm sorry.
Hey, so I'm gonna be out late tonight with the team.
I'm checking in with you in case dad calls from Syracuse.
We're celebrating after the game.
How do you know that you're gonna be celebrating?
it's important.
Well, what's that have to do...
I'm handling it.
Where did you get that bag?
I'm taking a class there.
In martial arts?
So is it an elephant?
A dinosaur?
Oh, come on, Malcolm, you need to give me a hint.
Oh, okay, is it supposed to be me?
Oh, my God, Emily, I'm so sorry.
Do the police have any idea?
They're still investigating.
They know it was a stolen car.
We don't have to do this now.
With the accident and everything that's going on with Hanna's mom... if I don't, then I'll start missing deadlines.
Emily, when I first got here, you and your friends were dodging some pretty serious threats.
You guys took a long time to speak up, and if this is happening again... it was an accident.
Some speed freak lost control and used my front porch as a bumper.
Where is this college?
Maryland.
She isn't answering my calls.
She's really ragged right now.
I drove by Emily's, okay?
They're still pulling pieces of that car out of the living room.
How are you doing?
We're trying to stay positive.
If "A" is escalating things, maybe it means that we're getting too close for comfort.
Maybe you and Toby are getting too close to Wilden's killer.
Anyway, that number that you pulled from Nigel's cell phone, did you ever figure out who was on the other end?
This college is tiny.
Is it worth even filling out an application?
Why not?
Well, if there's hardly any slots... well, let's not write our own rejection letter quite yet.
You probably have a better shot than most people.
Mr. Fitz, I don't swim anymore.
No, I'm talking about your work outside of the pool.
These little colleges are looking to build communities.
And they'd probably be pretty excited about the work you did last summer in Haiti.
That was for, like, three weeks.
Yeah, three weeks you spent volunteering, thinking about others and not yourself.
That's... pretty impressive.
I don't feel very impressive.
Are you still in touch with any of your old supervisors?
Somebody's gotta remind you who you really are, Emily.
If you wish to accept and pay for the call, please press three now.
So far.
Veronica told you about the bail and how they're gonna move me?
I don't want you to worry about this, sweetheart.
We are going to get through this.
I miss you.
I miss you.
We are going to be all right.
Veronica's gonna bring you here tomorrow so we can say...
So I can see you, okay?
Thanks for coming.
What do you want?
I'm gonna confess to killing Detective Wilden.
You're gonna help me.
You know what they did to me will be as bad as what they do to her.
That's probably true.
You're taking an awful big chance.
I can't let my mom go to prison
I mean talking to me.
Suppose I'm the one who actually set up your mother.
Were you serious when you said you never wanted this "A" to hurt my mom?
Yes, I was.
Well, then you have to help me do this.
Why me?
Because this is going to be the biggest lie I've ever told.
I need you to make it sound perfect.
Me, Spencer, the others, we all tell lies, but you're the only one who actually knows how to live in a lie.
Who are you?
I'm Beckett.
Sam or Saint Thomas?
I'm interning with your mother.
Goldberg penn law school alumni fellow.
Right, that's why you'd be at her office, why are you in our kitchen?
Blame the district attorney.
Discovery in the Marin case.
They send you everything and make you Wade through it.
D.A. got cute and sent to your mother's home address instead of her office.
You're gonna make a great lawyer.
Plenty.
Let me give you a hand.
What do you think you're doing here?
He was threatening me because I told people he got Alison DiLaurentis pregnant.
I think he might have killed her.
I think they sent us Wilden's grammar school report cards.
No, I checked the box numbers before I signed for them.
No, your daughter's here.
Your mother wants to know why you're not at school.
I'm checking on Hanna.
You hear that?
No, she's the only one here.
No, don't worry about it.
Yeah, yeah, take your time.
I'm good.
So I think that my little brother is taking a class from you.
I know that I shouldn't even ask that.
What does that mean?
I'm guessing some of his teammates think he's an easy target.
You didn't tell him that I said that I was scared, did you?
You're welcome.
I brought you something.
Have a cookie.
The minute Toby's mom died, you were questioned by the police.
By Detective Wilden, only he was officer Wilden then.
I wasn't questioned, I was interviewed.
They talked to everyone who was working that night.
And what did you say?
You've read it.
"He discovered the roof access door unlocked.
"He went up to the roof and looked over the east ledge and saw a body on the ground below."
Then why in the official report does it say that she jumped from a window and not the roof?
It doesn't make any difference, the woman's dead.
If it doesn't make any difference, then why would Wilden change the facts when he filed the report?
You think somebody paid him off to lie about how Toby's mom died?
Didn't you ever wonder how a guy like Wilden goes from being patrolman to Detective so fast?
Well, Toby deserves some answers... and so do I.
Spencer, if I were you, I would put this back where I found it and forget that I ever saw it.
It's not going to change anything, not for you, not for me, and not for Toby's mother.
Yeah, well, my friend Hanna's mother is sitting in jail accused of killing Wilden, so I need to know who else wanted to see him dead.
You said there was a woman's shoeprint where Wilden was killed.
Are they going to find a match with something from your mom's closet?
I don't think so.
They were hidden under the sink, and then they were gone.
You threw them out.
No, they just weren't there anymore.
No, Hanna, you threw them out.
They're the shoes you were wearing when you met Wilden at the lake and shot him.
Now let's talk about the gun.
You didn't tell me you came from perfect town, U.S.A.
So where you been, Joe DiMaggio?
You don't call, you haven't answered any emails, nobody's heard from you in months.
I know, I'm sorry.
Keeping busy is good.
I was just worried that you were still dealing with losing Maya.
Still miss her.
I thought it would take an entire summer to rebuild you.
Was I any help at all that summer or was I just another disaster area?
We had to pry the electric drill out of your hands.
I'm putting a crew together this summer, and I wish I had an Emily on every single team.
Where are you guys going this summer?
Nicaragua.
I don't think this is what you expected when you got involved with my daughter.
No, it's not.
Did she say anything?
Nothing.
She gets that from me.
And stubborn.
She can be.
She's very angry right now, and I don't want her making any mistakes because of that.
She listens to you.
Yeah, sometimes.
I'll do whatever I can.
That's what I'm afraid of.
No, I'll be fine by next summer.
I'm not looking to swim in college and... you don't need to sell yourself to me, Emily.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Oh, this is Zoe, uh, my supervisor for habitat for humanity.
I figured you were working today.
What's wrong?
I had to meet with a second adjustor, and it looks like we're not gonna be back in our house for months.
But I need to get this to the police, and I was wondering if maybe... yeah, I understand.
You're living in a motel?
Maybe I should've checked in a little bit more before I roped you into this again.
No, I wanna go with you guys next summer.
Is the sign-up form in here or should I do it online?
Where did you get the gun?
I found it in my father's desk.
I was afraid of Wilden, so I took it in case he ever tried anything.
They found your mother's fingerprints on the bullets.
I don't know anything about that.
Look, my dad had that gun when he lived with me.
What did that feel like?
What the hell kind of question is that?
The sort of question that will let them know whether you're lying or telling the truth.
Hello, Hanna.
Look what I found.
Mommy's not gonna be able to fix this one for you, Hanna.
And just like that, you pulled the gun on him.
He must have said something, done something.
But maybe you can fix this one for yourself.
I mean, you are your mother's daughter.
I thought you were supposed to be with your dad.
He had a work thing.
Hanna, what is she doing here?
Oh, it's so nice to see you, too.
I don't have the slightest inkling of what you're talking about.
Caleb, you were looking for me, you found me, and I'm okay.
It's my calming influence.
We're almost finished.
I didn't hear you leave.
You were busy.
What file?
I'll take care of it.
Suit yourself.
Mike's phone.
Who's this?
Tell me again.
I saw him in town.
You saw who in town?
Detective Wilden.
I followed him out to the lake, and I saw his car there.
But they found his car in town.
I don't know anything about that, but I saw his car at the lake.
Why?
Because of what he did to Ali.
He wants to hurt my mom.
Well, now it's his turn to be scared.
And I'm gonna make him stop.
You did this.
I'll do worse if you don't leave us alone.
You're in very big trouble, Hanna.
I can make your mother's life a living hell.
Unless, that is, you and I work something out.
You're the only one in the world who can do anything about it.
What happened next?
And then I ran away.
All I know is I killed him.
I shot him with my father's gun 'cause he was after my mom and no one was gonna help us.
Are you sorry that you killed him?
Where do you think you're going?
You didn't think I was gonna leave you alone with her, did you?
Uh, was he at a house party?
I know a place near there.
Uh, you know, I don't remember the street.
Yeah, let's do it.
Hold on, it's him.
He was just messing with you.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
It's three blocks away, okay?
I'll see you in the morning.
Why would he just put me through that?
He doesn't know I told you about his teammates.
So he probably doesn't know why tonight scared you so much.
If it gets out of control, I'll tell you.
You want me to stay for awhile?
Yeah, are you hungry?
I'll take that as a yes.
And you let Mona talk you into this?
And third, I am not gonna let you do it.
I have to do this.
Maybe "A" will settle for ruining my life and leave my mother alone.
Neither one of you is going to prison.
My mother's already there.
If they take her away tomorrow, I'll never get her back.
I just picked up some of the essentials.
Um, we're gonna try to eat out most of the time.
Did you drop off the... yeah, and everybody at the precinct asked about you.
I'm gonna be starting to look for other work tomorrow.
That's wonderful.
I'm glad there's someone in your corner.
She's leading a crew in June to Nicaragua, invited me to come.
Wants me to join the group for the whole summer until I start school.
She even said that she'd give me some sort of leadership role where I'd be, like, a team Captain or something and supervise the new volunteers.
What's wrong?
It sounds like a great opportunity.
Why don't you let me make you something to eat.
We can eat later, okay?
I'll fix you something.
Hey, I'm sorry if I hijacked your night.
Twice.
This one looks even more terrifying.
Fun terrifying.
I don't think anything yet.
Did you talk to Hanna?
Yeah, she's with her dad.
What's gonna happen to her mom?
They'll move her to the state facility tomorrow, which is excessive and interferes with my ability to mount a defense, and I'll keep after judge Reilly until she agrees to bail.
Oh, I should have warned Beckett about you.
Do you know what's in there?
That is not useless.
That is about Wilden and Radley and Toby's mom.
Wilden was at Radley the night that Toby's mom died, and what he wrote in his notes doesn't match the official report.
Somebody paid him off to lie about the facts.
Wilden was crooked, he was always crooked.
And this links what happened out there with Wilden.
Honey, nothing we do or say is gonna bring back Toby's mother.
If you want to help Toby, help him move on.
No, I haven't.
What do you mean?
When did this happen?
All right, I'll come right down there.
It's the gun... at least I think it is.
That gun was used to kill Detective Wilden, and your mother's fingerprints are on the bullets.
We entered a plea of not guilty, but the judge refused to grant bail.
- Who are you?
- Beckett Frye.
- What are you doing here?
What did the doctor say about your eyes?
I'll have good days and bad days.
On your darkest days you know I'll be here for you.
- I'm not a Saint.
- Just because a man has been ordained...
I'd like to speak to a detective.
Why did you kill Detective Wilden?
Then tell me about it again.
What did you hear Wilden say at the Halloween party?
He was worried that Garrett was gonna tell the truth about what happened the night Alison died.
Garrett was killed on the train, so why didn't you go to the police?
I can't let my best friend's mom go down for a murder she didn't commit.
I'll be right back.
Apparently after we left last night, Mona made a full confession.
Did you girls put her up to this thinking it would somehow help Ashley?
What makes you so sure that she didn't do it?
Things she said in her confession contradict some of the evidence.
I hope not, because if you girls are involved in any way, it will really hurt your mother's case.
Please tell me you had nothing to do with this.
Hanna was planning on doing what?
Why didn't she tell us all this last night?
What?
See you soon.
I thought we could grab some breakfast at The Grille.
I don't know what to think.
I just can't help but feel that Mona's gonna somehow drag us into this.
Can we take a Mona break for like two seconds and talk about your birthday?
It's not until tomorrow.
Who knows, by then I could be wearing an orange jumpsuit.
- What's this?
- An early birthday gift.
Dominic trains a lot of division one swimmers.
Yeah, and a few gold medalists, too.
Or that you have to go to college next year.
My mom and I are looking at three colleges next weekend.
State schools that you don't really want to go to.
- Yeah, it's not Columbia teachers college, but it's still a really great program and they offered me a stipend if I teach one class.
Anytime.
Well, ideal would be in this area code.
It's the only school that offered me money.
You're still gonna see Malcolm, Ezra, just not every day.
You mean not most days.
You'll have the summers off, and he'll have breaks too.
Nobody confesses to a murder they didn't commit.
I think Mona was just trying to help.
They... they dropped the charges?
No, not unless they find something to corroborate her confession.
Since Wilden was a police officer, the bail is set higher than usual.
How high?
A million dollars.
So that's the full tour.
- There's no slackin' here.
So your friend mentioned you were thinking of holding off college for a year to train.
Uh, I'm considering it.
Please, have a seat.
Let me tell you a little about how I run things.
I also monitor what you eat, drink, and how much you sleep.
I know the difference.
Let's have a look at your recruiting video.
Dad, I know it's a lot of money, but you only have to put up ten percent of the million dollars.
Well, try harder.
I left you a few messages.
Yeah, I know.
I think about your mom all the time.
I mean, I wish there was something I could do to help her.
She acts like she can handle being in there.
But I know she's trying to put up a front to protect me.
Well, I don't know if I will.
They can leave her in there forever, and it doesn't look like my dad's gonna come up with a hundred grand anytime soon.
What do you need that kind of money for?
It's what she needs to post bail.
Caleb's trying to sell his car, but it's not gonna be nearly enough.
How long are you gonna be gone for?
I'm looking at tickets for a Saturday, so it'll only be a day or two.
I'd really prefer if he didn't miss any.
You're gonna be so busy with school, and he's not gonna know anybody out there.
He's good at making new friends.
He could always stay here with me.
I mean, I have more free time than you.
And it's equally important for him to spend time with his father.
Yes, but I'm the one who's been there for him for the past seven years.
And whose fault is that?
Hanna's convinced Mona did all this as a way to right all the wrongs.
Yeah, but Mona was there, too.
Not according to the picture.
She's gonna love it.
Okay, we should go.
I told Paige we'd be at her aunt's house in like 20 minutes.
With everything that's going on, I still don't understand why she's throwing this party.
Shana, they know I'm hiding something.
If the cops really thought that, you'd still be there answering questions.
It's too dangerous not to say anything at this point!
Just give me a little more time to figure out where she is.
I don't have much time left.
Your mother has a guardian angel.
My bail was posted anonymously.
I guess that's how your dad got around Isabelle.
Well, at least he did it.
Just remember, you can't leave the house unless it's for a court date or a medical appointment.
You think this thing will detect a sip of chardonnay?
That thing will detect a whiff of chardonnay.
Look, I know that these rules are upsetting, but it's better than the alternative, right?
You're welcome.
Try to relax, get some sleep.
Should we call dad and thank him?
You didn't get a tattoo while you were in there, did you?
You're pulling too much water.
And that flip toe is too far from the wall.
If you're willing to commit, I can help you.
- Really?
Yeah, just as soon as my shoulder heals.
That's even if you don't have surgery.
But you can still help me, right?
Emily, I'm sorry.
Am I crazy, or did it sound like Jenna was saying she knows Alison's alive?
That or she knows who killed her.
Yeah, but Jenna's not just gonna tell us.
Well, she might if we could pry her away from Shana.
Jenna's really vulnerable right now, and not just because she's losing her sight again.
How does that even happen, anyway?
One minute you have it, the next minute, poof, it's gone?
Well, Toby said that that operation has a really low success rate, so apparently she's one of the unfortunate ones.
He's on his way back from New York right now.
Because until tomorrow morning, wherever Shana goes, Jenna goes.
Now, I know a lot of family lawyers, but Greg is the best.
Do you think I have a chance?
It's not my area of expertise, but I know it won't be easy.
That's because I didn't know he existed until recently.
And two, you aren't listed as the father on his birth certificate.
So what are you saying, that I don't have any rights?
Can he help me prevent Maggie from moving to Seattle?
No, no, they're not here yet, but I'll text you when they show up, okay?
Emily just texted she'll be here in a minute.
Hey, birthday girl.
Everything okay?
Why did you lie to Dominic?
So, did you know Paige was gonna plan all this?
I just wanted to stop by, welcome you back.
I was ashamed.
The thought of you being in there is... look, I know you have a lot of catching up to do with Hanna, but when you settle in, I'd love to take you to dinner.
It'll have to be in my kitchen.
How do you like my new accessory?
Anything looks good on you.
It was hard enough coming back to this town in the first place, and now I have to be around them?
And me.
No.
Jake's here.
I lied to him about what I was doing tonight.
Yeah, she's trying real hard.
Um, are you forgetting that he spent last night on your couch?
Yeah, but he came to the party with her.
They're here.
Why didn't you tell Dominic I was injured?
I wanted to make sure he'd see you.
You know... for a minute there I actually thought maybe this could happen for me.
He'll train me.
He just doesn't think I'll be ready in time to get a scholarship.
We can get another opinion.
Why are you pushing this so much?
I know how badly you want to swim.
Or you mean how badly you want me to swim?
What do you think's gonna happen if I don't go to Stanford with you?
Three thousand miles is a long way.
Four years is a long time.
A lot can happen.
We have to face facts.
We're not gonna be together next year.
- Is your coach here?
Wow, look who's back in town.
It's nice to see you, Jenna.
I see everything that I need to.
Is there something you guys want?
You keep an eye on them and I'll get everybody outside.
Mona, why did you do this?
You're welcome.
- Family movie night, huh?
- Look, ya know, with everything that's going on, I totally spaced about Emily's party.
It's not like you had to invite me.
So... who's Barbarella over there?
- Name's Kim.
Looks like the two of you have been having a great time together.
- I didn't say that.
- You're not jealous?
Why would I be?
We're not dating.
We're just friends.
I... need to go find Spencer.
Yeah, I... should get back to Kim.
There's a lot of people who came to see you here tonight.
Think you can go back inside and at least pretend to have a good time?
- About what?
You were spying on us?
We're out of here.
Jenna, wait.
Look, I know exactly how you feel about me, but Ali was my best friend, so if you know anything about her, you have to tell me.
- I don't have to tell you anything.
You wash, I'll dry?
You know, I'm actually looking forward to doing both.
Well, before you do, I think I owe you an explanation.
You don't owe me anything.
I want to explain.
Things... he knew about, and he... he tried to use them to hurt me and Hanna.
He was a corrupt cop, Ashley.
Everyone has their limits.
Can I drop off dinner for you and Hanna tomorrow night?
Only if you stay and eat with us.
It's a date.
Hey, have you seen Spencer?
Yeah, she went outside to look for Jenna.
Where's Kim?
Oh, my God!
What is it?
I thought she was inside!
What happened?
Did somebody push her in?
I think somebody hit her first.
There was blood on the back of her head.
What hospital did they take her to?
Listen, I just got off the phone with your father.
he didn't put up the bail money.
It was Ted.
I guess so.
So what's gonna happen next?
We can think about that tomorrow.
I still can't believe you were the one who saved Jenna Marshall.
Who would do this to her?
We don't anyone did for sure.
She had a gash on the back of her head, Paige.
She could have fallen in, hit her head on a rock.
I think someone wanted to make sure we didn't find out what she knows about Alison.
Thanks for coming over.
I keep thinking if Emily had pulled that girl out just a couple of seconds later, she probably wouldn't be here.
I knew your life was complicated, but I didn't know it was anything like this.
I've had a long history with Mona and Jenna.
If I explained everything, we'd be here till I graduated.
I'm starting to see why you're so on edge all the time.
I feel safe when I'm with you, though.
And I'm sorry if I ruined your night or anything.
Kim's just a friend, Aria.
Maybe you can let someone else help you navigate for a while.
See what happens.
Okay, yeah.
Maybe I could.
Ya know, and see what happens.
So on a scale from one to ten, how jealous were you tonight?
Em, are you asleep?
Was it Ali?
Well, then who is Jenna so afraid of?
- I'm getting my shit.
- I got my shit.
What is she doing here?
She's my new associate.
Maybe it's time we get down to business.
Good, because the first order of business is discussing what to do following Ava's statement.
The problem is she's on trial for murder.
And public perception says that she's as guilty as Jean Valjean with a loaf of bread in his pants.
We're facing a vote for control of her company in two days.
Talking under threat makes her look desperate.
And not talking makes her look either guilty or incompetent.
We need to send the message to Wall Street that she's in control and she's got nothing to hide.
This is a meeting about how to keep Ava's company without endangering her murder defense.
Did it ever occur to you that, if she's cold enough to kill off opposition to her pipeline, she's cold enough to pull off lying to the press?
I mean, we all know she did this, right?
This isn't open for discussion.
She's not saying a word.
I'm afraid it's too late.
What did you do?
An exclusive forum which needn't be the case.
Go ahead and order.
I wasn't trying to keep this from you.
I suggest you don't think of it as muzzled so much as keeping you out of jail for the rest of your life.
And what'll you have me do, Harvey, hmm?
I know that's not going to happen.
But if you think saying you're innocent is gonna make people believe you, it won't.
Ava, you're on trial for your life.
This company is my life.
And that's exactly what it's gonna look like-- a greedy oil exec clinging to her money factory with her blood-stained hands.
Um, before anyone sugars anyone, if you two are dating, you need to know that we have a very strict policy in favor of that.
And we have a very strict policy to keep our sugar to ourselves.
Oh, that's a pity.
I'm partial to a little sweetness in the morning.
Oh, that man is trouble.
Haven't you ever heard, "go after the second prettiest to get the prettiest's attention"?
Oh, the dress.
It's practically a different company.
What's going on with Ava Hessington?
I convinced her not to give an interview.
Stupid cat.
How dare you sabotage my case?
Yeah, because I knew the minute things heated up on the takeover attempt, you'd want to take my case back.
Ava Hessington is Hessington Oil.
Excuse me?
You and I both know who assigned me to this case, and it wasn't you.
It was the man you chose to merge with.
The same man who has a 51% share of our law firm.
So unless you're gonna undo that, you're gonna live with this.
- It's not an option.
And you don't trust him to play by the rules.
Which is why you're gonna work side by side with her to figure a way out of this jam.
I didn't ask, but I sure as hell wouldn't.
What is it, Louis?
I just wanted to thank you for backing me earlier.
I had your back because you had the best strategy.
What exactly are you proposing?
Allow me to be your black swan.
Let me do the things that your position precludes you from doing, the dark choices, the distasteful wet work.
You mean like using lye to dissolve a human body?
I mean using lies to dislodge a pesky CEO.
And Harvey and his master Lord Poppycock don't have to know.
Louis, I appreciate your offer, I do, but--
But the one time you take my side over his, you're not willing to fight for it.
I'm willing to fight.
That was not the same.
I get it.
You were in charge then.
You're not in charge anymore.
There's a time to be gentle, and there's a time to be firm.
You should see how I handle the fax.
See, I'm in the states on a limited basis, and I've got nobody to help me with my workload.
I get it.
You're forced to do everything yourself.
It's getting exhausting.
And you need someone to help relieve the pressure.
Not Rachel?
It'll be a brief, casual arrangement whilst I'm in New York.
I wouldn't have time for anything more.
Then we have an agreement?
I don't know.
What kind of boss would you be?
Demanding.
You do realize that this arrangement would involve no secretarial work?
I'd be disappointed if it did.
- Katrina Bennett.
- At your service.
- God, I love the sound of that.
You want a gun or a knife?
Louis, why aren't we just kicking Ava Hessington out?
She'd be gone before she even knew what hit her.
If Harvey had half your brains, that's exactly what we'd be doing.
But he doesn't, and as much as I hate to admit it, he's in charge of this decision.
He's not in charge of this firm.
Go to Jessica, she'll agree with you, you'll get the credit, and Harvey will be off Hessington Oil before he even knows what hit him.
Touch it?
This room is a disaster.
This room is fine.
I know where everything is and what everything is.
What are you even doing?
Monopoly?
And even if you could, these are all the companies that Gianopolous owns in any way, and these are the biggest companies in the oil industry.
There's no way to connect the dots.
Well, do you want to go down the same road and have another fight or do you want to try to figure out a way--
- Shit.
We've been looking in the wrong place.
This is not a coincidence.
Well, I hope it's still going to be lovely.
I need you to make it perfectly clear to Harvey that he has no say in the Hessington Oil takeover battle.
And why would I do that?
Because he's making a huge mistake and using your name to do it.
And let me guess, you'd like her to remove herself from management.
She can do it herself, or I can do it for her.
But either way she's got to go until this trial is over.
I'm afraid I don't see it that way.
Listen to me.
She stands to lose control of this company permanently if we don't do something.
Then do something.
I'm trying, but you're cutting off my legs because of a bond you had with her father.
No, because I value relationships over money.
Well, I value the terms of our merger.
And Hessington Oil was one of your biggest selling points.
And Harvey Specter one of yours.
I'm not going to stand for losing this takeover.
One more thing.
Instead of spending firm money to fly to another country to question my judgment, feel free to call first.
I'll be happy to give you the same answer over the phone.
This is brilliant.
I already have.
Why do you want to give him credit?
Because if I don't, you won't listen when I say you should take him with you.
I'm not taking anyone with me.
Tony Gianopolous gets blown out of the water, and Mike gets blown away.
And Jessica hears about it all.
I'm gonna suggest this to Harvey.
Feel free to tell him it was all your idea.
Harvey, I was just gonna run something by you.
You only gave it to me because you hadn't realized that you were responsible for turning Ava's bribery charges into murder charges.
Get out of my office because I got a meeting to prepare for.
What just happened to him?
Have you seen this?
It's an article, in today's Wall Street Journal painting me as the picture of corporate greed.
As I told you before, if you speak out--
I have the chance to save my company.
Well, you wouldn't be doing your job if you didn't.
And you're not getting through me.
Well, perhaps I have the key.
This represents the totality of Gianopolous Limited holdings.
And if you don't leave 'em alone, you're gonna be tied up with my friend from the FTC until kingdom goddamn come.
Got that, spank?
We went to Wharton, and we saw you coming a mile away.
Christina will validate you on the way out.
Finally cleaning up?
Can't stay here forever.
How'd your meeting with Ava go?
We're working on it.
Thought you'd be with Louis.
He went to go see Gianopolous by himself.
I hope it works.
We have a good plan.
Okay, so you watch The Sopranos too?
Nobody watches The Wire without starting with The Sopranos.
Truce?
Truce.
You trying to score some extra edamame from the delivery guy?
Please, Yuki always brings me extra edamame.
Well, then who's the touch-up for?
And did you do a costume change without leaving the office?
I'm not gonna even dignify that with a response.
Oh, my God, did you agree to a hot and steamy affair?
- Louis, what can I do for you?
Louis, I'm not taking you off this case.
Wait, are you saying that I have your blessing to go to the board and convince them to ditch Ava Hessington?
I'm not saying anything.
This conversation never happened.
Would that put a crimp in your evening?
Well, I guess I could scalp your ticket, seeing as it is the hottest of the season.
You know, I practically had to sell my spleen for them.
Did you also hear that I traded him my spleen?
Didn't you?
You know, I'm actually to theater what Harvey is to sport.
I'm better than good.
Then we better get going.
Is that really necessary?
It will be in the deposition.?
Did you bribe a foreign government?
You have to own it and move on.
And I suggest you do it more believably, because when you're up there staring down the barrel of 12 executioners, there's no changing your mind.
I'm just giving you the facts.
Cameron's gonna rattle you.
And it's gonna work, because you and I both know you did this.
- How dare you!
- How dare I what?
This is your idea.
Then ask me a goddamn question.
You bribed that government.
What's to stop anyone with a pulse from believing you knew that money was payment for killing those people?
Because life is more important to me than money.
Then why the hell did you pay that bribe in the first place?
Because that's how it works over there.
Murder is also how it works over there.
And you're not convincing anyone.
Very good.
Finally we get to it.
If you check your records, you'd know the reason we won that bid is we were the only company who took it upon ourselves to go to the people.
Because you needed to see what your obstacle was.
My obstacle?
We paid $100 million more than anyone else on the condition that the money be used to relocate any family who lost anything within 50 miles of that pipeline-- job, home, land, livestock.
Anything.
What happened over there sickens me.
I lose sleep over it every night.
So I've had just about enough of you two wondering whether I'm guilty of these murders or not.
Is that a good enough trial run for you?
She didn't do it.
If the only way to beat Tony Gianopolous is to get rid of her, then I don't think we have a choice.
If you need cover for the other board members, then you can just tell them that Pearson Darby recommended that.
And I'll recommend to them that we retain Pearson Darby.
So we have a deal.
What's the matter with you?
We just deposed Ava Hessington.
She convinced us that maybe she should.
Well, there would be only one reason to even consider that.
She didn't do it.
You said, if she's cold enough to do it, she'd be cold enough to lie about it, but this woman is about to lose her title, her company, her whole life...
You don't have to believe me.
Take a look for yourself.
- He agreed.
- She's out.
It'll be done tomorrow before the tender offer vote.
She's innocent.
What?
Take a look at this.
And preempt tomorrow's meeting with one of our own.
Get it done.
I can't.
Why not?
Ava Hessington had nothing to do with those murders.
How do you like that?
Louis, if they don't oust her tomorrow morning, they will lose that takeover vote tomorrow afternoon.
She will be pushed out either way.
Well, at least I won't be responsible for taking away an innocent woman's company.
You're not responsible for it.
This is a hostile takeover.
They're coming tomorrow, and the market doesn't care whether she's innocent or not.
And he would have thought that before.
Please do not stop me from going back to that board.
Louis, you offered to do this.
This conversation did happen, and it's over.
How long have you been standing there?
Long enough to know that if this law thing doesn't work out, you'd make a lousy boy Friday.
I'd ask you to help, but I wouldn't want to take advantage.
I'm nothing but a piece of meat to you, aren't I?
Quiet, copy boy.
Same time tomorrow night?
Absolutely.
Interesting.
If you find copy rooms interesting, you need to get out more.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were sleeping with him.
Suffice it to say, I was awesome.
- So what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna tell him as soon as he gets back.
He's gonna meet us over there.
I just got voted out of my own company.
Wait, the vote on the takeover isn't supposed to be till this afternoon.
Well, they had a different one before that, and I'm out.
And what I want to know is, did you know?
Ava, I didn't go behind your back.
Well, you may not have gone behind my back, but this never would have happened if you'd let me speak publicly in the first place.
Because an interview isn't the same thing as a closed-door meeting within your own company.
I may be out, but you're not.
Pearson Darby has been conveniently retained as Hessington Oil's legal counsel.
I stand by what I did, and I'd do it again.
You mean selling Ava out because of your personal issues with me?
Ever since Darby handed me this case and not you, you've been pissed.
I wasn't pissed until we had a disagreement on strategy, and you invoked his name to cut me out.
I get it.
I merged with Edward for the sake of this firm, just like what I did today with Ava.
And the only one in this room taking things personally is you.
Tell yourself whatever you want, but don't tell me it doesn't have to do with Darby and don't tell me it isn't personal, because you can't stand being number two.
I need Edward Darby on the phone right now.
I was in the copy room.
Well, what the hell were you doing in the copy room?
I was finishing up a couple things for Stephen.
What do you want?
I want to tell you that I enjoyed working with you.
I thought I was gonna be able to say the same.
If it means anything to you, I told Louis to stop the plan to get rid of Ava.
Is that supposed to make me believe you?
It's supposed to make you understand me.
You're loyal to him.
I'm committed to him.
Good night, Katrina.
Good night.
What did she want?
Nothing.
I mean, I just kept seeing you guys working together all the time, and you just seemed to be bonding away.
You didn't think it was sweet when I was jealous of you and Jenny.
Which is why it bothers me more now.
What are you-- what are you trying to say?
You know what I'm trying to say.
And in this moment I don't care who knows.
What you did amounts to nothing short of insubordination.
Did you fly all the way from another country to tell me that?
You could have just called.
I gave you a very clear directive, and you defied me.
Are you saying you regret this merger?
I'm saying perhaps I should have paid more attention to the red flags, such as covering up the embezzlement of a former partner.
Something you were more than willing to use to make the deal.
You went behind my back.
And you stuck me with this case and then risked losing me a huge amount of money.
I gave Harvey this case after already handing you a huge amount of money.
I am in charge on this side of the ocean.
Because I allow it to be that way.
And there it is again.
51-49.
Until now I believed that Harvey was the wild horse that couldn't be tamed, but perhaps it is you.
I think maybe Harvey was right.
It is personal.
And as you pointed out, I had a partner once who made decisions based on his personal shit, and I will not allow that to happen again.
We're patriots.
I am going to rip them apart from the inside until they are begging me to die.
You got a big problem on your hands, sheriff.
Hi, sheriff.
- What's behind the red door?
People go in, and they don't come out.
My son, Andy, went in.
I bet you're regretting your career choice about now?
Walker.
Your dad told you stories of Walker, Texas ranger?
Why?
For a dead guy, okay.
How long did my heart stop?
2 1/2 hours.
Why did this happen?
Hey, pal, stop right there!
I said, stop!
Listen, Marty, I hear you.
After what happened to the sheriff, it's just safer we all stick together.
Shouldn't be more than a few days.
Come in a little closer, 'cause I don't want to have to yell this.
It's a scary story, so we need to keep it quiet here.
Okay, you ready?
So, once upon a time, in a city called New York, there lived four brave souls who called themselves "the Ghostbusters."
It all started in the New York public library.
I'm not gonna let you get yourself killed.
- I owe him too.
I'm sorry.
Rise and shine.
All right, listen up.
I'm gonna patch you up, but if you try anything cute, you'll get a lot more than a blast of rock salt this time.
That's my partner.
- Yeah, that's right, I dropped it.
But we've been tracking him for months, so I can't let you screw it up now.
So what are you gonna do?
Depends on how pleasant you are.
I meant with Monroe.
We're taking him to our employers.
You're bounty hunters.
- What U.S. Government?
What the hell are you talking about?
Well, then you're even dumber than you look.
Which, believe me, makes you seriously dumb.
He'll escape and slit your throat, and then you won't have jack squat.
I liked it better when you weren't talking.
Boy, you really are something special, fancy pants.
Titus is gonna want to have a word with you.
No, thank you.
You people are doing the Lord's work.
So before the blackout this Allenford woman worked for the D.O.D.
Well, I guess it's not even a secret.
I'm sorry, but what the hell does this mean?
Are you sure about this one?
He was with the rebel unit in Ashland.
These are the people who dropped the nukes.
I am sure of it now.
I lost my kids in that blast.
We all lost people.
Are you interested?
I heard what happened, Aaron.
I'm just glad you're all right.
Well, then, that's a miracle, no two ways.
I get it.
I'm not really the one you want to open up to, right?
Just answer me one question.
You were there the night that the bombs dropped, in the Tower, right?
Randall pushed the button, didn't he?
I knew it.
I walked him through the front door.
I might as well have pushed the button myself.
You don't know me, Charlotte.
Well, did it ever occur to you you sucked at your job?
You don't.
So watch your mouth.
You don't get to tell anybody anything.
You're nothing.
Just a drunk fighting for a coin in a whorehouse.
We're friends, right?
I mean, you spent more time passed out in my tub than you ever did in your own bed.
This guy, Stu, who is he to you?
He's a friend.
Sorry, Rachel.
Listen, I got a pretty full afternoon, so whatever you're gonna do, just do it.
I hear you're a hell of a swordsman.
Not like the rest of those sheep in town.
If only you hadn't gone back for that whimpering slut, you might have just gotten away.
It's a better one.
Can you... you can hear yourself, right?
Are you aware of how creepy you sound?
Simply for images I had on my computer, for art.
And all the boys in my care, some of them thousands of miles from home, they were free too.
Many of them are still with me, free to do whatever they want, whenever they want to.
No limits, no rules.
How is that not a better world?
- Who's that?
Well, he never made it.
What are you doing in Texas, anyway?
You mouth-breathers never make it this far south.
What are you after?
That's a surprise.
But I can't risk you murdering any more of my kids, either.
Be out of here in a minute.
This way, ma'am.
Gun!
Gross.
Guess you're not as lucky as I am, pal?
Help!
Somebody help!
What are you doing on the floor?
So what are you gonna do to me?
Well, you are a complete pain in the ass.
Not unless I have to.
You killed him, you son of a bitch!
And they're handy in a fight.
Look, I've never been able to shake you out of a bad idea once you get it into your skull.
All right, then.
Like you're going without me.
I was holding him.
His blood was on my hands.
Because crazy is what's happening.
Okay, look, maybe there is an explanation.
Maybe this is a miracle.
From God?
Please don't talk to me like that.
You know, just because I believe does not make me a whack job.
Ben was just a misfired synapse in my clearly mushy brain.
I know what brought me back.
You do?
I'm not sure there is a why, other than some malfunction, but I know what.
And I also know what caused the blackout, if you're interested.
What the hell are you talking about?
Drop it, Miles.
What's going on?
Don't worry, it won't hurt for much longer, fancy pants.
You're next.
Have a seat.
Well, I owe you a great debt of gratitude, Mr. Crane.
Thank God you showed up when you did.
Well, I hope you don't think that was an accident.
I meant to be there.
I noticed that young man this morning, eyeing you like he was Lee Harvey and you were J.F.K.
My gut told me to follow him, so I did.
- That's some gut.
- This isn't my first rodeo.
I worked security for the Monroe militia.
Even met Monroe himself, once.
In case you haven't noticed, you have a security problem.
And why should I trust you?
You mean, besides me saving your life?
After all, you were Monroe militia.
But I was born an American, and I would like, very much, to be one again.
I'll just have to keep my eye on you, Mr. Crane.
Give me a torch.
Holy hell.
We are safe here for now.
- What is this place?
- There isn't time to explain.
You've been charged to a larger purpose.
Conquest, War, Famine and Death, Ichabod.
The very one whose head you claimed on the battlefield.
But now he's returned to gather the others.
Together they will unleash the Apocalypse.
Before the Four Horsemen can ride, an army of evil will make way for their arrival.
The first dark spirit rises with the blood moon.
She's one of us.
One of who?
Morning, sir.
I must to speak with Lieutenant Mills immediately.
I can't let you leave the room.
You're a material witness in an ongoing investigation.
Well, I'm afraid it cannot wait.
Lieutenant Mills will be here shortly, sir.
That's one way of putting it.
You're damn right they're scared, the whole town's scared.
- What about Brooks?
Come with me.
This is two minutes after the duty officer closes the door.
Give us a minute, please.
Sir, I'm telling you there was something in that cell with him.
I assume you're referring to Mr. Crane, our resident time traveler.
Sir, you were in the interrogation room.
That is hardly without precedent.
We sent his test in for further psych evaluation.
The doctors say our man suffers from a disorder known as "objective transference."
He may really believe that he decapitated a Hessian soldier during the Revolutionary War, that his wife is a witch who put a spell on him, and now he woke up two centuries later in Sleepy Hollow.
So you think we're both crazy?
Possibly.
But in the absence of options, you and this Crane may be my only choice.
Do not embarrass me.
This is unacceptable!
I will not be held prisoner here!
Mike.
If I'm charged with no crime, why am I under guard?
Well, for one, it's the law.
As a free man, any law that takes away my God-given right serves neither God nor its own design.
Someone's given you reason to doubt my veracity.
After all we've seen, you're still holding onto uncertainty.
I'm trying to hold onto my sanity, not to mention my job.
Look, I just spent the last hour defending you to my captain, so do me a favor and don't look at me like I'm the one that's crazy, okay?
I've had enough of that for one lifetime.
Now I'm no more eager to accept it than you, but if Katrina's warning is real... and we shall soon find out... then it appears evil has found a new home... in Sleepy Hollow.
Release who?
Okay, let me see if I got this.
Because?
That is a discussion for another day.
With an additional tax of 41 cents?
No, no, don't try to change the subject.
Somehow you fell in love, you get married, but the whole time you have no idea that your wife is a witch?
Ah, she was protecting the fate of the American Revolution.
No, what's insane is a ten-percent levy on baked goods.
You do realize the Revolutionary War began on less than two percent?
How is the public not flocking to the streets in outrage?
Point taken.
What were you trying to tell me, Katrina?
One of who?
What are you talking about?
She was referring to a witch.
He sent me to help you find the people you're looking for.
And to give you a message.
"The ashes of the pious will ordain your resurrection.
Name, please.
It's hard to explain.
I need your full name.
Uh, Jeremy Steven Furth.
I was on my way to Quantico two seconds ago to be a criminal profiler, and now I am profiling a witch.
It's gonna take a little catching up for me.
I mean, what, are we supposed to do, put out an APB on a woman with warts and a broom?
Lieutenant, I, too, believed that we lived in a world where superstition gave way to reason and logic... until General Washington brought me into a secret war with forces which, like you, I'm yet to fully understand.
And even so... you still doubt your own eyes?
Look, I know what I saw with you.
I'm not pretending that I didn't, but usual police procedure isn't gonna cut it in this case.
You've not had appropriate time to mourn your sheriff.
Excuse me?
He was more than just a colleague to you, wasn't he?
The demon you and your sister saw in the forest, he believed you.
I saw it in your eyes at the burial, Ms. Mills.
Please... help me understand.
After Jenny and I saw that thing... it got pretty bad for a while.
She was sent to the institution... and I did a lot of stupid things to try and shut it all out... drugs, me and this guy I was seeing broke into a pharmacy.
Cop car pulls up, guy bolts, just gone, and this sheriff steps out the cruiser.
But instead of taking me to jail, he takes me to a diner.
He orders apple pie and says...
You know what I love about apple pie a la mode?
Where the warm, crunchy crust comes together with the smooth, frozen ice cream.
And in about five minutes, all the ice cream melts and becomes a warm soupy mess.
When that happens... we're leaving.
So you got five minutes to decide if you're gonna change your life, or if I'm taking you to jail.
So I changed... right there.
I got more fathering in those five minutes than I got my whole life.
Go ahead, Charlie 101.
You said to keep a lookout for any unusual activity?
Derek, what happened?
We're still putting the pieces together.
Vic's name is Jeremy Furth.
What is that?
It looks like... claw marks or something?
The ash within didn't simply fall away.
It's as though someone collected something.
Does that mean something to you?
Indeed.
What do you mean you know who did this?
One night, my regiment was returning to camp near Albany.
The moon hung low in its cycle, as it does now... a blood moon, as Katrina described.
The destruction was far too extensive for common artillery.
There were bodies everywhere.
Our men, reduced to ash, which gave way to a darker revelation as I sensed a presence in the woods around us.
I could not have told you back then what it was I saw that night, but it chilled my blood like nothing before.
These strange murders became more frequent.
Soon, a tale spread of a dark coven... led by a high priestess known as Serilda of Abaddon.
General Washington came to believe the redcoats had formed a dark alliance with this sorceress.
Damn it.
Just perusing, thank you.
You're Ichabod Crane.
I am indeed.
Treatises of Civil Government.
With a focus on the American Revolutionary War.
What war did you fight in, Professor?
One that I pray is never doomed to repeat itself, sir.
Facial expressions have changed little, if at all, over the centuries.
I need clearance to get in, and Irving isn't answering his phone.
Your affair did not end well, I take it.
What was the impetus of your disbandment?
We broke up when I was leaving for the FBI.
I will literally pay you to stop talking.
I would happily accept because I am in need of currency.
And now I'm gonna show you another.
What is this?
It's been sealed off.
What are you doing?
During the war, we built a series of subterranean tunnels beneath the city... to allow us to transport munitions and supplies in secret.
This entrance... should connect us directly to the annex.
Shall we?
Mind the rats.
Yes, I do.
End of that tunnel bares the bones of convicted witches.
Why are they buried down here?
It was decreed witches were undeserving of a proper burial.
But Katrina had a headstone.
It's all still here.
We coded all of the crates.
BP in red marks black powder.
Does gun powder have an expiration date?
Best not to tempt fate.
The Battle of Lexington was plotted in this chamber.
Well, now it's where hard copies go to die.
Another figure of speech, I take it?
All police reports, newspaper articles, historical records.
Pretty much everything we'd ever really want to know about the history of Sleepy Hollow.
Recorded history.
It appears little of what actually transpired found its way into your textbooks.
We better split this up.
Careful, kid.
Imagine how your mom and dad would feel if you got run over.
Uh, my dad's dead.
My sympathies.
What's your name?
Kyle.
Ky-Kyle Hemmington.
It's a nice name.
I'm sorry it had to be yours.
Go inside, Kyle.
It's getting dark.
Serilda of Abaddon.
Otherwise referred to as the language of the Gypsies.
Sights, sounds, even smells.
Except, ironically, for the 250 years I can't seem to recall, which makes it of little use.
Ah, here we are.
It appears Serilda's fate was sealed by her enemies.
A benevolent coven known as Sisterhood of the Radiant Heart.
Their leader used white magic to weaken Serilda, making her vulnerable to mortal attack.
A hunting party finally captured her in the woods around Sleepy Hollow.
You are condemned, and you will burn.
Have you last words?
I will live again."
The magistrate who sentenced her, what was his name?
The victim in the car accident, his name was Jeremy Furth.
"The ashes of your ancestors will be mine."
She requires the ashes of his descendants to return to life.
"She must complete her resurrection by the turn of the blood moon."
According to genealogical records, the magistrate had a son whose bloodline traces to Jeremy Furth.
Mom?
Mom, I saw a woman and she looked like she was on fire.
I saw her.
My husband's urn.
But the boy is the last remaining Hemmington by blood, is he not?
No, Kyle's adopted.
My husband was the last Hemmington.
Why?
There's little time left.
The blood moon hangs low, and now Serilda has the ashes of the last known descendants.
She can only be made whole during the blood moon.
We must find her before she completes her resurrection and return her to the ashes from whence she came.
No, really.
I don't need any help, as long as you're comfortable.
It's been, what, 250 years?
Maybe we've got the wrong spot.
You're welcome.
Oh, no, we're too late.
Just aim and pull the trigger.
Yes, I do recall how to use a firearm, thank you.
The crates.
Crane, your gun!
You only fired one shot.
What's she saying?
Brace yourself.
Crane!
Get down!
Lieutenant?
I'm afraid neither of us can.
But I do take comfort knowing that this strange road we find ourselves on... can only be traveled together.
I think we could both use some morning cheer.
Coffee?
You look lost, kid.
What is this?
I'm dreaming, right?
Well, what difference does that make?
Would you have believed me if I did?
You spent a lot of time running away from what happened to you, Abbie.
I asked you to be helpful.
I don't know how to do this.
You're so afraid of what you don't understand that it kept you from seeing who you really are.
What you were meant to do.
Which is...?
The only person that can tell you that... is you.
That's what faith is, honey.
I really miss you.
Don't be afraid of number 49.
That's where you'll find you're not alone.
Lieutenant.
Are you all right?
Tonight, Mills.
Seen any more monsters lately, Jenny?
No, ma'am.
Open.
Good girl.
Lights out in five minutes.
We done our duty tonight, boys.
Nobody else was gonna help us.
She would've made a lousy Supreme.
And that is something this coven just can't afford at this moment in history.
Particularly since you lost your tongue.
Deal with that.
I couldn't stop it.
Jesus, what happened?
My God, what happened?
This girl was attacked near to death while you slept.
This was dark art voodoo, flat out.
This is your fault.
It was a personal matter.
Christ, Delia!
I left there with nothing.
Move.
I got a heartbeat.
But maybe we should get her to a hospital.
The last thing you want is to have the Council show up on your doorstep and question your competence.
Get out of there.
She saved me... that black girl.
Just keep that information to yourself, you understand?
What if he comes back?
Now I want to pay you this time.
Hey, what's that?
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.
Do you know why today is my favorite day of the year?
I suppose you'll want me lighting the bonfires and putting out food to keep the demons at bay.
Evil spirits will walk the earth this night.
And as far as silly superstitions, you're behind the times.
Who's the baddest witch in town?
You saw what she did to Bastien.
You were the hero of that story.
You sat across from them and you made peace.
No more bloodshed at one another's hands.
The rest of the world was cruel enough.
Chantal, I know you mean well, but the truce is over.
What time's your meeting with Phil Underwood?
Kaylee.
It's my favorite holiday.
I think Halloween gives people the permission to be who they really want to be.
I was a monster.
No, honey, you're not dead.
Let me get you a fresh towel.
I don't know how to thank you for saving my life.
I guess you'll just have to work on that then, huh?
Council on Witchcraft assembles only under the gravest circumstances.
Elaborate, elucidate.
But it was never my intention to violate the truce.
I see, well, perhaps we should all sit down.
Fiona, it's been a long time.
Quentin, you vicious old queen, hmm.
Just remember whose magic it was that put you there.
Fiona... you're a caution.
That's why we're here.
Madison is a spirited girl.
The fact that she stayed out all night is hardly a shocker.
So it's not unusual for you to lose track of your charges for extended periods of time?
Did she give the impression of being a particularly powerful witch?
That thing you lack, darling.
Charisma.
Madison Montgomery is a stone-cold bitch who loves hard drinking, big dicks and trouble.
If she's dead, it's probably 'cause she got wasted and offered the Grim Reaper a hand job or something.
Who else knew about this?
You brought soup?
There's a vending machine in the lobby.
I was in a place in San Diego once where they had sushi in the vending machines.
The raw fish stuff?
Mr. Big Shot USDA Agent.
They call us inspectors, not agents.
I'm not a spy.
You got an online girlfriend in every port, 007?
You getting possessive already?
No.
To think I found you in an online community dedicated to collecting Thomas Kinkade paintings.
Hey, to be fair, I found you.
Other guys online come on so strong, so fast.
You were... cool as a cucumber.
What?
I am, after all, the Supreme.
Sadly, you are.
Though given the state of this coven and this school, one could be forgiven for thinking we've been without a Supreme for the past 40 years.
If you don't like the way I run things, take it up with the Council.
You must be present for the betterment of our people, not just off jet-setting around the globe to sate your vulgar, licentious appetites.
We must assume the worst.
You say she was... heading somewhere when she spoke to you.
Did she give you any indication as to where?
But she took a fine bottle of wine with her.
She said it was a final peace offering.
Anna Leigh recently negotiated a truce with Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen.
You don't suspect the colored witches are involved in this?
Gather yourself, girl.
You need to reach deep and exercise your strength now.
We have something to tell you.
From time immemorial, our great people has chosen to uphold and uplift one among us who was born destined to lead.
She'll end up being the youngest Supreme in history.
I can't believe she's getting away with it.
Getting away with what, dogface?
I'm a Guardian of Veracity in the Vernacular.
I know when a lie's being told, and I protect the truth.
Fiona aced transmutation and pyrokinesis.
You notice how Spalding spends his life cleaning up Fiona's messes?
If Spalding does know something, he's not talking.
Thank you, Spalding.
Oh, my God!
Everyone, back to your rooms this instant!
The time has come for you to pay for every crime you've committed.
The Council reminds you, no witch has been tried, convicted, and burned at the stake since 1926.
I'd like to call our final witness, Spalding.
Some call it coincidence, others call it mystery.
As to me, I can't imagine living under the same roof as the monster who dismembered me, making her breakfast, pouring her tea.
But you have nothing to be afraid of now.
He's not going to have a choice.
I enchanted his tongue so it's incapable of speaking a lie, and I happen to know the Council's calling him for a closed session tomorrow morning.
I got your note.
And you killed an innocent girl because she was the next Supreme!
You always have been!
The hallmark of any rising Supreme is glowing, radiant health.
My mother is the Supreme for a reason.
Trick or treat!
Oh, little beggar children all fancied up.
Then why can't I hear her?
We should be out looking for her.
Fiona told us to stay inside.
You'll make a bad girl of me yet.
Well, Christ knows, somebody's got to, darling.
Is your seat belt fastened?
Nice and tight.
Why do you hate Hank?
And I don't understand how you cannot see that.
So, answer my question.
Who do you think is my replacement?
You're obsessed, aren't you?
Why?
Hands off.
You don't get anything.
Actually, these cookies are for you.
For me?
I wanted to pay you back for that delicious cake you brought over.
Charmed.
My, my, Jacques, what a suave fellow you are.
But I wonder if you're brave enough to visit my Chamber of Horrors.
Mother, I doubt that Jacques is interested.
I might find the courage if the lovely Borquita was by my side.
I fairly swoon when I see the moment of terror register on a handsome face.
Makes me feel young again.
This way.
Can you guess what's in the bowl?
Madame LaLaurie, it must have taken you all afternoon to peel these grapes.
Would you care to try your hand at the next surprise?
I'll give you a hint.
They're long and... wet and... very slippery.
I'd... venture to guess a string of sausages?
Oh, you're not man enough for my Borquita, much less my Chamber of Horrors.
Who would ever suspect foul play from the grieving daughters of their beloved mother's untimely death?
You are wicked, Borquita.
The only question is how.
Come on downstairs now and be festive, my darlings.
Dessert is about to be served.
My dear, the guests have been asking after you.
Send me Bastien and two strong slaves.
Break her leg if you must.
It's because of my love for your plain faces that you can still draw breath.
Be good, little birds, and I'll set you free in a year.
A year?
And you, ringleader of the feebleminded, you've earned a special present.
It's too late now even to light the bonfires of protection.
All hell has opened up on our doorstep.
You guys, did you get a load of what's going on outside?
Let me see it!
Are you Mrs. Foxx's mother?
Our best guess is someone threw sulfuric acid on her.
I've only seen burns like this in industrial accidents.
It burned through the optic nerves.
Is she blind or not?
What are they?
They're not even doing anything.
It's her voice mail.
Oh, shit.
Dude, your prosthetics look awesome.
Begin.
If we can't go out, we'll go up.
Come on.
Now!
You didn't throw that acid, but you might as well have.
Stillborn, or did it die after?
Stillborn.
Is it a girl or a boy?
She's a girl.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Now talk to her.
Tell her... "I love you more than the whole world."
Tell her.
You're beautiful.
Tell her again.
I'll be your mother until you die.
What's happening?
Oh, shit!
And get me a Coke!
Who's there?
What has she done to you?
What have I done to you?
I would make amends.
She should have been back already.
Go see what's keeping her?
Oh, shit.
Holy shit, you killed it.
She had a monster for a mother.
This last act... was the only kindness I ever did for her.
I'm sorry.
Get him inside, go!
Be in your nature.
I don't know what that was, but they got some real power in that witch house now.
Well, look who finally showed up.
Why don't you go sleep it off?
Now, I may not have been the mother she needed me to be, but I can smell the bullshit in your pockets even if she can't.
I begged her not to marry you.
You're a loser, running around your whole life chasing after penny jobs, huh?
'Cause you know she is the best you'll ever have.
Thank Christ you couldn't knock her up.
Can you imagine her with an infant now after you run off because you can't take the pressures of a blind wife?
Permanently?
Oh, boy, here come the crocodile tears.
No, Fiona, no, you will not do this to us.
I love her and she knows it.
I don't care who it is, but one of you is leaving or I'm calling security.
You have 15 minutes with her, and then I'll be back and you will disappear.
I'm here, baby.
Can you feel me?
I don't care what they did to you.
He can and he will.
No sense rushing him back to his Holy Roller mother till he recovers.
She'd only call the cops anyhow.
Thank you.
Those are my daughters.
This is how it ends-- in flames and decay.
They deserved a better mother than I could ever hope to be.
Time to deal with the rest of the trash, I see.
Fiona Goode, you stand before this council accused of gross neglect, malfeasance, and a willful disregard for the well-being of this coven.
She's desperate.
Well, it's not going to work, not this time.
This council's decision is unanimous and final.
Now, it's true this coven has been under attack but not from outside-- from inside.
Our enemy hides in plain sight.
Our enemy has a face and I have seen this face.
This face has a name.
I've been more of a mother to that girl than you have ever been.
You latched on to my daughter the minute I passed her into your care because you could never have one.
I never had children because I dedicated my life to this coven.
What is she talking about?
I told you, she's trying to confuse you.
Who is Jennifer Wooley?
I'm sure I don't know.
Jennifer Wooley is the Veronica Lake character in the movie I Married a Witch.
She's twisting everything!
So, it's true?
You've been leaving here under a false name?
She had to be stopped!
I don't need a confession.
You have been caught red-handed.
I will have justice.
The same acid that disfigured my daughter did this.
Myrtle Snow... have you anything to say in your own defense?
Burn the witch.
Seconded.
The decision of this council is unanimous and final.
Until I found my place in this coven.
I go proudly to the flame.
Go ahead.
Burn me.
This is just a joke, right?
We're not actually burning her.
You're all a bunch of little toads in a pot that Fiona is slowly bringing to a boil.
You won't even feel it until it's too late.
I'd rather burn than boil.
Come in.
Queenie, well, what can I do for you?
You're hurting me!
I'll do more than hurt you!
I will have justice!
But I thought we were going to oust her, not roast her.
Sit down.
Do what, Queenie?
Live with this.
A necessary first step to fulfill your promise.
And under my tutelage, my mentorship, well, you could rise to heights that you dare not even imagine.
Follow my instruction to the letter and you'll be fine.
i know, kylie says you're always stuck at the precinct.
there's a lead on the nightingale strangler.
we're looking for a white male, 5'10", medium build, brown hair, small scar on his right cheek.
his m.o. is he finds lonely women with no friends, poisons their food, and then guts 'em in his van.
last seen wearing a salmon shirt, grey blazer, and witnesses have said he has trouble fitting lettuce in his mouth.
apparently has the world's smallest penis and doesn't know how to use it-- hi, there, i'm jake peralta, amy's boss.
that's not true.
who is now leaving.
and with a record five felonies solved in one week, peralta pulls ahead.
light 'em up, boyle.
[cheers and applause] that's the sweet taste of triumph.
i just got a doa on bessimer street.
you're the primary, you're in charge.
detectives, our monthly crime statistics are due.
i want all paperwork on your closed cases by tomorrow.
i already got my paperwork in, captain.
then i guess this little reminder isn't for you.
wow, looks like he hates you even more than me.
no, sir, i wasn't--peralta was the one that was talking.
god, you must have been the worst fourth grader ever.
be careful.
i happen to be a very good secondary.
so you were just borrowing those cars?
captain, santiago broke the glass.
i could go on and on and on.
i know you will, jake-in-the-box.
but you should pick the music, primary.
how do you want me to proceed?
thank you.
this is how i walk.
what do you need, quasimodo?
i gotta go meet with boyle and peralta.
is there something wrong with the captain?
it seems like he's in a bad mood.
you all right, captain?
i went to barbados with my husband.
we wove hats out of palm fronds and swam with the stingrays.
i've never been happier.
both: what do we got?
sorry, sorry.
you're the primary, you're in charge.
all ri-- i'm calling natural causes.
this case is open and shut.
just like his mouth was, constantly.
diaz, check and see if there's boyle, see what you can find in the bedroom.
i'll take the kitchen.
yep, that's exactly what i was gonna say.
it's weird.
i know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult.
can you please draw a perp for me?
i can never read him.
you look chipper, captain.
there was a small fire in my home.
i lost many photo albums of treasured memories.
i'm devastated.
i'm telling you, and there is something bothering him.
can you help me out?
great.
ma'am, can you please describe the perp to sergeant jeffords?
yeah, he had, um, dark, curly hair, and a neck tattoo-- wait, wait, wait.
do you even want your purse back?
so far you've managed to tell three fat jokes and completely bulldoze charles.
is that your idea of being a good secondary?
first off, i've told four.
i mean, i started cataloguing the contents of the fridge, but it turns out there's not enough paper on earth.
jake, for once, just hang back and let boyle do his job.
you look like an idiot.
i'm so sorry for your loss, mrs. patterson.
can you talk about what happened after breakfast?
i'm just in shock.
we were going on a cruise together next week.
he had pre-purchased the unlimited soda package.
i'm sure the soft drink industry mourns his passing.
i'm the new medical examiner.
how's the patterson case looking?
it looks like natural causes, but i'll know for sure once i get the autopsy results tomorrow.
i'm really glad you could sneak away from your case.
she hasn't sent the autopsy report.
oh, that's strange.
maybe probably a bunch more people died and she got super busy?
okay, just let me know when she calls.
you got it.
[clears throat] hey, can i ask you guys something?
can you keep a secret?
do you know anything about my life?
okay, so you know the new medical examiner?
i kinda had sex with her last night.
what?
oh, sorry, i forgot who i was talking to.
i meant, what were you thinking?
anyways, back to last night.
like a dead guy?
you have a really nice chest.
thank you.
i'd love to crack it open and get my hands all over your organs.
okay... i wonder how much your appendix weighs.
for some reason i kinda started getting into it.
oh, what do we have here?
but what do i find when i probe a little farther?
oh, uh, 24 hours.
perfect.
what are you guys talking about?
um, just weird sex stuff that has nothing to do with work.
it's questions like that that made van gogh cut off his ear.
you can't put a clock on art.
so we can give holt some good news.
well, how do you even know he's in a bad mood?
i mean, it's impossible to read that guy.
this is the most incompetent, worthless report i have ever read in my life!
and if anyone can figure out what's bothering him, it's me.
he and i are exactly the same.
except that i'm younger, cuban, female, single, and straight.
boyle, where's my paperwork on that doa?
supposed to come in first thing this morning, but so far, nothing.
that's not necessary, sir.
for the record, i think it's natural causes anyway, but i'm also the secondary in this case.
but don't ever bup-bup-bup-bup me again.
right, i don't know-- bup-bup-bup-bup...
yep, i am going to regret teaching him that one.
patterson's wife told me that they were going on a cruise together next month, but her credit card bill shows only one ticket booked.
either she's lying or she knew he was gonna die.
jake went down to the m.e. an hour and a half ago.
i mean, he's really coming into his own as a secondary.
we better go down there.
see what's holding him up.
good call.
[clears throat] hello.
shirt's buttoned wrong.
i haven't seen him.
(peralta) [coughing] hold on.
i am so lost.
do you know where the vending machines are?
look, it's not what it seems like.
yes, it is.
i came down here to get the autopsy report and in conclusion, here we are.
now if you'll excuse me-- look, i'm sorry i slowed down the autopsy results, but everyone knows it's natural causes.
wait, like a murder murder, or, like, his mouth murdered him by making him eat so much food that his heart exploded?
we need the autopsy to be sure.
i have not gotten to that yet.
you guys have been down here for two hours.
what, did you have sex 40 times?
40 times?
no, charles, like-- we didn't know it was a homicide.
i'm your primary and i asked you to do something.
so if it's okay, i'd like to be upset with you.
now, dr. rossi, will you please perform the autopsy for us right now?
actually, with a body this size, and i gave him the rest of the afternoon off when jake showed up.
guilty.
okay, fine.
i will act as your assistant because i am a wonderful secondary.
yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising.
oh, will you look at that stomach lining?
i don't draw giant-head people on surfboards!
without his refined artistic skills-- finish the paperwork by noon.
i want it included in the crime stats.
sarge, i need you to do one more drawing for me.
what?
it'll cheer the captain up.
if i'm gonna do this, it has to be done right.
scully, get me my oils.
here it is.
that's what i'm talking about.
that was the air releasing from the large intestine.
okay.
well, i know you're having a bad day-- i think you're having a bad day.
so, to cheer you up i had terry do this painting to replace the photo you hated.
i threw away the photo because i think it's ostentatious especially when you haven't earned a place on the wall.
here are the contents of his stomach.
get in here, look at the scarring on this liver.
cause of death: poison.
ingested.
no more weird dead guy sex for me ever again.
oh, that is terrifying.
what now, santiago?
that's not your concern.
they're exactly the same as last month.
if this is your strategy to cheer me up, it's backfiring.
sir, i don't think you realize how good flat numbers are.
that's a win.
thank you, santiago.
you know, we're birds of a feather, you and i.
i hate cliches.
we know you killed your husband.
that cruise you planned was for one, plus the autopsy showed clear signs of poison.
my only question is, why'd you do it?
um, he drove me to it.
he had affair after affair.
he was a real don juan.
it's terrible.
the brushwork is sloppy.
i'd like to take this home for my husband.
he'll be glad you made me look so happy.
(diaz) nice job, boyle.
i may, for the first time, have been a bit of a jerk, and i'm sorry.
what a wonderful moment.
i agree, it is a wonderful moment.
i'm the secondary.
you sure you're not just sneaking off for more weird dead guy sex?
we will never speak of that again.
never.
i hate small talk.
let's drink in silence.
This madman is holding our city hostage to his twisted whim.
Millie, do you think playing the Victrola will suffice?
Come Tuesday evening, a jazz ensemble in New Orleans will be more precious than the Hope Diamond.
We're inviting an attack-- it could not be more clear, Sister.
The real question is, what are we to do?
Ladies, we have been docile too long.
We're on the verge of our greatest victory, giving us the equal right to vote.
If we embody our feminine might, intelligence with grace, strength with an iron will, no man can make us cower in our home.
Well, he's not gonna lay a finger on you.
Rumor has it he's got a thing for jazz, and you've got, uh, rhythm in your soul, baby.
I gave fair warning, girl.
His mom keeps slamming the door on me.
We'll go to Fiona.
Madison wants us to find her, and we can't afford to lose a single witch if we want to survive.
From now on... we watch each other's backs.
And what is this green shit?
Where'd you find the spirit board?
More like it found me.
Do you know what these things do?
I saw my grandma use one once.
She thought it was cool, too, till a bad spirit came out, burned her house to the ground and took half her face off with it.
There's three of us.
Are we alone?
Did you die here?
Were you murdered?
"You did."
Madison, is this you?
Who are you?
Axeman.
Never had the gift of mind-reading before.
Is it the medication?
It took her so long to find the right man.
And here he is, week after week, holding my hand, cleaning up my vomit.
Please take a seat and finish your treatment?
My daughter needs me as she's never needed me before.
I want one more great love affair in my life.
Now I think what I really want is just to belong to somebody.
It's not too late for that, is it?
Blow the bank on it.
So he chopped women up 'cause they wouldn't be his groupies?
Plus men who protected them.
We never got to ask about Madison.
Witches killed the Axeman.
If there's even a chance he knows where Madison is, we got to make contact.
Nan?
You left your lives and came all the way across the country just to puss out now?
If this is all the fight we have left in us at the end of our race, witches deserve to die.
Where's Madison?
Tell me and I'll give you what you want.
Don't you want release?
She's right here.
Why are there roses in here?
Well, doctor said, uh, bed rest for at least a week, hmm?
I had to go blind to see things about you I couldn't see before.
A bad cosmic joke.
It's a different kind of clarity, an absolute clarity I've never had.
You know what they gave her before we left the hospital?
I'm high all right, but it's not the drugs, and rest assured, you will be accountable for every single betrayal, no matter how deep you think your secrets are buried.
I'd get out while you still can, jug head.
I wanted to sever his arms and throw him out the window.
I had to stop myself.
You've been given the Sight.
It comes in bits and pieces.
Let me help, honey.
Auntie Myrtle.
Fiona's leaving in a taxi.
Here's how this works, asshole.
We ask the questions, you think the answers, she reads your mind.
You killed Madison, didn't you?
Sex.
Madison Montgomery, she was so beautiful.
The moment we met, I knew that only by sliding myself into her cold, stiff, unyielding mound would I ever feel like a real man again.
Turn me in to the authorities, exposing the coven, bringing us all to ruin?
I think you're smarter than that.
What's he saying?
You like my swamp water, don't you?
Got to have patience.
Won't be long now.
What are you doing here?
All clean.
Get him out of here.
He broke Stevie.
I'm taking you both out of here.
I need your help.
We have a problem.
He likes you.
He murdered his mother.
What can you do?
Plus, she's missing an arm.
I have it.
I can sew it back on her like I did with Kyle.
Have you seen his scar?
You have to bring her back.
Give me some of that mud.
You risk an awful lot coming here, you know that.
I thought I'd hired me a professional witch hunter.
I'm really glad you decided to come and see us, Kaylee.
It's a haven where you can learn about who and what you are.
What do you think I am?
Why don't you tell me about the last fire?
You said that you loved me.
I changed my mind.
Will you just give me one goddamn reason?
There's something not right about you, okay?
I'm sorry, Kaylee.
I don't really like to talk about this.
Wouldn't you like to be surrounded by people with similar gifts?
I just want to find a good husband and have three kids.
I think I have a really good shot.
I work out, and I play Fantasy Football.
Nine Salem descendants in just three years.
Five of them I never would have found without Delia's research.
Maybe we should take you off the payroll and put her on it.
Sounds like she doing all the work.
This is what we agreed to!
You're in love with that sorry witch.
I'm not taking him.
He's a walking tornado.
I was... and I am.
Real bad.
There's something foul in this house.
I always hated this room.
What's the last thing you remember?
A-After that, it's all... dark.
Did you see a bright light?
What do you want?
Don't think so, dirty pussy cat?
Goddamn witches.
They ended me once right here in this very room.
And for years after, the parties and the music and the dancing raged wild outside while I sat trapped inside these four ugly walls.
She asks her favor, and I provide.
The only way I can help you is if you let me out of here.
You see, I had a... a contract.
Promises were made, and all you've got to do is sing and dance and call the witches who owe me my freedom.
This don't end till I get out.
Now dance.
We need a spell to make him move on.
I told you not to mess with that spirit board.
Yeah, there's a shit ton of books in there, and not one of them is written in English.
This one's it.
What you drinking?
Hello, my shadow self.
I want to use Silas' death to bring Bonnie back to life.
I can feel you.
Bonnie?
I'm back.
But our victories came at a cost.
My hair is going gray, and my teeth are falling out.
I'm not sure what that suggests, but it's definitely not health.
Every supernatural being that passes over to the other side will pass through you.
That's gonna hurt like a bitch.
And new threats are about to arise.
The good news about having vampire blood in your system is that's step one to creating a new vampire.
This is step two.
Preliminary report subject 62547.
Subject has transformed from human to vampire in approximately 14 days.
Indicators predict a positive response to first bag of undiluted Augustine blood.
Physical strength is an unforeseen side effect.
Terminating transfusion.
Activating emergency procedures.
I know we haven't seen each other or talked in a while, so I wanted to make you a video update.
Hi!
Which equals massive cause for celebration!
Which equals a massive party.
Hopefully since each of us have only made one friend in college so far.
Um, I have to go register for classes.
What?
I still don't need to rub it in her face day one in the triple dorm room.
This hair, by the way, kind of hot.
I'm ready.
Who's Aaron?
See you tonight.
Speaking of moody or making out?
Either way, he'll never show.
I bought bourbon, so he could just get drunk and hate us from afar.
Well, I'll be sure to relay the message.
Then Elena promised a bottomless well of top-shelf alcohol.
How about my favorite reading chair?
Just tell Elena thanks, but I'm not really up for a party tonight.
How about now?
You realize that every single time you say no it just makes you hotter, right?
Eye contact.
So over the summer, I went to Prague, met a girl.
And then her boyfriend put some spirit thing in my head.
Protect it at all costs.
He's a Traveler.
Travelers are a faction of witches.
That girl, the one that followed you back from Prague, was she, um, I don't know, feisty, a little accent, ridiculously beautiful?
Pretty much, yeah.
Who the hell turned you into a vampire?
We're going to call them and tell them that you lost your phone but you're ok.
Where is Wes now?
I locked him in his lab after I attacked him.
Well, you're new, and you're hungry.
How are you doing?
"Our" stash?
First rule of being a vampire is realizing how awesome you are!
How's he doing?
So I could avoid talking to anyone.
You survived a pretty traumatic event, and now you're back, and you've got nothing but free time to just relive that terrible experience in the safe.
I only had my newborn ripped from my arms by my judgmental father and then had to run 500 years after my entire family had been slaughtered by a psychopath, but, hey, that didn't have any lingering side effects.
Stefan, I'd like you to meet Nadia Petrova, my daughter.
You'll be great.
Your eyes keep scanning the room.
Friend with benefits?
He's my best friend's little brother, he's still in high school, and I...think I'm madly in love with him.
You realize that Damon's going to kill Wes, right?
What I want is to be drinking copious quantities of booze and making out with my girlfriend, but unfortunately, I can't do that until I get a bunch of answers out of you.
Well, that explains it.
Fair enough.
We're gonna play a little game where I inject you with whatever the hell necrotizing fasciitis is.
So I'm gonna do that, and I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions.
If you don't answer me correctly, we're just gonna have to see how much flesh these little guys can eat.
Just out of morbid curiosity, which one of you is younger?
I am.
Now what are we doing in here?
Take a seat, Matt.
This is ridiculous.
What the hell was that?
She's calling on Matt's passenger.
What do you want?
Here's the thing.
Nadia's my only child, so naturally, I'm suspicious of anyone who wants to date her.
Why don't you tell us the real reason why you're in Mystic Falls?
How did you get that?
I would much rather be getting drunk right now, so why don't you stop wasting our time and tell us what you're doing here?
I didn't see that one coming.
You were using me to get to her?
Why would you kill her?
See why I don't want you dating my daughter?
Because Travelers are ruthless, manipulative hypocrites.
I know because your grandfather was one.
There's a reason why he wanted this knife so badly.
It's the only thing that will truly kill a passenger.
What is it about this place that turns people into mad scientists?
Human trials are a vital part of modern medicine.
Yeah, but don't people usually volunteer or sign waivers, maybe get some dough for tuition.
Sometimes you do what's necessary for the greater good.
Sounds fun, doesn't it, and appropriate given the circumstance.
Are you doing ok?
Am I on the famous other side?
It's better than being dead.
It's ok, honey.
Dying wasn't fun, but then you felt my pain, so I guess you know that.
I'm sorry, but you know what?
To register for classes.
That feels amazing.
I am awfully smart.
What?
Last time I kissed you, you got all weird, and it was awkward, and--
Human blood will only satiate Jesse temporarily until he gets a taste of what he really craves.
Well, what exactly does he really crave?
You bit me.
So how'd it happen?
I went to check it out, and I saw blood everywhere.
They had bite marks all over their neck.
Bite marks?
So Wes is the closest thing to family I have left.
To call Damon, to make sure that he doesn't kill Dr. Wes.
There you are.
Get away from me.
You have two options, Stefan.
You either deal with this now, or you run, but either way, it's gonna catch up to you.
I can't breathe, Stefan.
Gius-- Giuseppe Salvatore.
And the next?
Focus on the name.
Thank you.
You deserve better, Nadia.
You're gonna turn another vampire, you're gonna do another experiment.
The only way to really handle you is just to snuff you out.
You're lucky I don't feel like burying a body.
Now I want to feed on the girl I like?
You feed on monsters, Jesse.
Actually that's not 100% accurate.
What the hell did they do to you?
What did you do?
He was gonna kill Damon.
But we promised that we would help him.
Go ask Dr. Frankenstein.
Because the Elena that I used to know would have given Jesse a chance.
Dear Nadia, sorry I had to kill your boyfriend, but it was the motherly thing to do.
Suicide, however, not very motherly of me.
I ran from my enemies for 500 years, and then one day, I stopped.
Now a new enemy wants me dead.
Sure I could run from the Travelers, but there's still one enemy that I can never escape, time.
Good-bye, Nadia.
What are you doing?
I told you you either face your problems, or you run.
I chose option 3.
And what problem has you jumping off of a clock tower?
I know the Cure did something to speed up the entire mortifying process.
Suck it up.
I'll admit it.
Step away from the candles.
Oh, my God.
I think Jesse's dead.
What?
Bonnie, what's going on?
What is it?
I'm the anchor to the other side, Jer.
Every supernatural being that dies has to pass through me.
How often does that happen?
Why--why didn't you tell me?
I'm back here, touching you.
We knew there would be consequences.
Just kiss me.
It was out of line.
It just sucks, you know, cause Jesse was one of ht good ones.
I know, and I wouldn't have killed him if I could have done something.
I need you to believe me when I tell you that Caroline.
I believe you, ok?
If you're gonna do this, I'd much rather prefer a bullet through the brain.
Actually I'm gonna wait until I can compel all this out of your head.
What the hell's that?
Why does this say 12144?
What do you care?
Vampire lab rats, coded subject names.
I thought you guys shut down 60 years ago.
You thought wrong.
You know how I said I wasn't gonna kill you?
I lied.
Atomized Vervain.
When working with vampires, you can never be too careful.
I'm sure Augustine will be thrilled to have you back.
What happened here?
Cheerleading.
Yes, this is Dr. Dana Marsh calling.
I'd like to report a possible case of abuse involving a minor patient.
How badly do you need this money?
I think I might have a solution.
Are you looking for this?
Can we watch cartoons now?
So, how's he doing, anyway?
What sins have you committed?
I've made some mistakes.
I had a problem, he solved it on his own.
I was impressed.
That's good to hear.
But how far is too far?
Is it all right to do something wrong for a good reason?
That's a question only the Lord can answer.
But you need to confess your sins.
Until you do, there will never be true repentance.
We all set?
Sometimes I need to hear you say it out loud.
If things don't proceed as planned, Sawyer will be fine.
Yeah, I know that.
You're worried about Dr. Sanders.
She's tough.
I wasn't expecting this level of resistance.
Good news is, we still have eight days.
But I'm gonna need some help.
From who?
If I can turn Brian into an ally, I can turn Ellen into a killer.
What's up, brother?
What the hell you doing here?
I was about to ask you the same thing.
What they get you for?
Somebody help me!
Keep the body on ice and keep your mouth shut.
We're gonna be fine.
You hear me?
Your lawyer's here.
It's not polite to keep a woman waiting.
It's time to get this thing done.
Took me two days to get transferred to the right unit.
I didn't even see Malik's punk ass until just now.
He talks, we all go down.
What?
Nothing.
You look great.
When this is all over, I'm going to do everything I can to be a better husband, a better partner.
I want another chance.
We can talk about all that later.
After we...
After we kill this son of a bitch?
So what are you saying?
I don't even know what kind it is, how potent...
The President's surgery cannot be delayed.
Regardless of his health, his blood tests, his EKG.
How's an extra 10 G sound?
Keep your money, I'm good.
Business is business.
But you already paid me.
Consider it a gift.
What, you can't give me a pound?
Keep it moving, boys.
Vanessa, we're in the middle of a...
I won't be long.
You're a coward.
Perhaps I should just wait outside while you finish...
It's a family event.
Doesn't Peter's memory mean anything to you?
I would like to introduce Dr. Sanders.
Hi, Morgan, pleasure to meet you.
I'm following up on a report from your OB/GYN, Dr. Marsh.
She noted bruising on your arms and legs.
Like I said, I just bumped it in gym class.
Can you show me the bruises?
Had.
How do you two get along?
Can I go?
I'd like to talk to her brother.
Peter's politics didn't coincide with the President's, and so this benefit dinner tomorrow night is more sensitive than one might imagine.
I presume my sister's outburst will remain confidential?
I told my husband to fire you.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed your speech about being a great thoracic surgeon.
And I respect your confidence.
But I'm an unforgiving woman, especially in matters involving my husband.
I understand.
So, I just want to make myself clear.
If another innocent mistake occurs, I will hold you personally accountable.
District of Columbia Police Department.
And who am I talking with?
You okay?
Look, I know this has been stressful.
You weren't expecting to be here this long.
Nothing to worry about, Coach.
I'll be back in a little bit.
Wait, where you going?
What are you doing?
Must be painful, huh?
We need to patch this up.
You used to work for your father's construction company, so fixing a tiny bullet hole like this should be pretty easy.
I think I can handle it.
Thought you were on your way to the hospital.
Well, I'm sorry, I forgot.
But if I don't show, he'll start calling and asking lots of questions.
Make it fast.
Ellen?
I want him dead.
Where you going?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stay away from Malik.
Next time, I won't be so gentle.
Everything at home is great.
Do they fight, argue?
Does it ever get physical?
Do you know her boyfriend?
Just one more question.
How'd you get that bruise on your eye?
Someone other than him.
I got into a fight, okay?
What time do your parents come home from work?
That wouldn't really...
His name is Boyd.
Thirsty?
No.
I know this has been difficult.
We never planned on being in your house this long.
As long as Ellen cooperates.
Kill the President.
Correct.
So if she does this, she injects the President with the poison... he'll die instantly?
Within seconds.
You're positive?
I need to know, if I ask her to do this, it's going to work.
That he'll die right away and will it be traceable?
Will it look like he's dying of natural causes?
I need to know that, uh, she won't get caught.
She won't.
She respects you.
Yeah, she used to.
Your marriage can survive this.
If you two really love each other, you'll be fine.
I'm gonna need some more pain meds.
You stay here.
I'll get the pills.
She's asleep.
I'm staring at her right now.
She's beautiful.
Sure thing.
- Help you?
- Murphy, right?
You're in the wrong zip code, my man.
You might want to invest in one of those GPS things.
Name's Archer.
- She got the gift?
- Yeah, sure did.
No, not exactly.
What do I need to do?
- Whatever it costs.
- I'll call him right away.
Make this Duncan guy think that you've given up.
- I'm gonna help you get through this.
You thought my dad's badge was his heart, remember?
- Why are you lying?
I'm sorry.
- Go find Anna and finish your homework.
- But I already did my homework.
Well, then go play on Grandpa's computer.
Anna!
Sawyer's on her way up.
Can you help her get on to my computer so she can play some games?
Who is this?
Not many guys would bounce back the way you have.
Impressive.
A little plaster, a little drywall, you can erase just about anything, huh?
Truth is, you did the right thing in that moment.
Sacrificing yourself to save your family.
But things have changed.
You know you can't escape.
But you can still control your destiny.
If you can convince Ellen to do as I say, life goes on.
You don't, the story ends.
I need to use the bathroom.
Everything okay in there?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm just, uh, I'm feeling a little nauseous.
Why in God's name are you doing this?
The reason isn't important.
What if I don't do what Duncan asks?
Fifteen years ago, you killed that son-of-a-bitch rapist.
I'm going to take care of everything.
Do you want me to tell you what happened?
You're a strong woman, I've seen it with my own eyes.
This was your idea?
And how do you know she'll come through?
Someone tough enough to actually kill the President.
I want to make sure you understand my position.
You're a political whore devoid of any true emotions.
Youngest Senator in the history of Virginia...
He would have been President someday.
He would have been President now.
You are a beautiful woman.
Paul, no.
I was just expressing an opinion.
Not a day goes by that I don't hate myself for it.
Hate is such a strong word.
- Where are you going?
I do hope your sister understands the President's dilemma.
She'll be fine.
Well, if there's anything I can do to help, don't be afraid to ask.
Why would I be afraid to ask, Quentin?
You work for me.
She and Peter were very close.
About the same age, they spent a lot of time together.
- I understand.
Now that is the truth behind the lie.
Can you check to see if my lawyer's here yet?
Just got a call about you.
Sign in over there, leave any metal objects in the basket.
- Your lawyer just got here.
Hey, Ray?
Command, we got a problem in the yard, we need backup.
This operation is much bigger than you think.
- What are you saying?
- There's no way out.
If the President doesn't die, we do.
You, me, Duncan, your family.
Killing Duncan is a terrible mistake.
The second he's dead, my partners will cut their losses and slaughter each and every one of us.
What are you doing here?
I just got a call from a lady at the Department of Social Services, okay?
Okay, what happened?
Is someone abusing you?
When did she leave?
You're sure she understands the situation?
Do you know where your wife was today?
I told you, we don't talk very much.
She's still very upset about Samantha.
- I thought we were on the same page.
I don't know how longer I can do this.
- Are you...
- Sober as a judge, Dad.
Have been for two years, in case you're interested.
Then what is it?
I killed him.
I had to get Sandrine cash.
Otherwise, she was gonna leave.
I was trying to help Duncan.
So we robbed a poker game.
- That's where the incident occurred?
You're gonna be fine.
Pull yourself together!
There's no time for all this.
- Good to hear.
- I'll make the call.
I thought you don't drink.
I don't.
Then why start?
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.
You don't really believe that, do you?
Let's get out of here.
Kramer Delaney?
Detective Fritz, DC Homicide.
I'd like to discuss the death of Tim Grace.
All right, we're done.
No, I'll take care of it.
Nice job.
Stop!
Previously on Hostages...
Who the hell are you?
- Glad you could make it.
You're talking to the wrong girl.
Okay, a spy.
What are you offering?
Just because we're sleeping together, you do not get to treat me like your secretary.
I want to expose it.
Kramer took a photo of a guy talking to the Secret Service agent.
If he's trying to kill you, why is he on his way to New York?
He's scheduled to be in New York all day tomorrow.
The president is gonna be in New York today.
Another team is being assembled to take him out while he's there.
- How exactly is that on us?
So how do we do it?
But now that we're here, we have to do everything we can to make the right decisions.
We shouldn't be helping these people.
- What about when we don't have a choice?
- It means that when this is over I want you to be able to look at yourselves in the mirror.
I don't want to let them turn you into something that you're not.
They made you lie to Boyd's father about his death.
And they made you come up with a phony alibi for Kramer.
Where is this gonna end?
And if it does, then...
If it does, then what?
I don't want this family to lose its way.
I'm glad you called.
So all I gotta do is tell you what's going on?
Like I said last night, all I need is information.
I want to know if Duncan's sticking to the plan, that he's watching the Sanders family 24/7.
And, if he's not, call me.
How do I know you're gonna deliver on your end of this?
And what about the cash?
10 grand is nothing to the people I'm working for.
They just wanna know what's going on with Duncan.
You made the right decision.
I've gotta get back.
You're gonna be in here for a while, so make yourselves comfortable.
You and I are gonna try and narrow the search.
They'll most likely bring him through this back alley, here.
Why don't we simply call in a bomb threat?
What are you doing here?
I thought we had an arrangement.
Because... we always said you would move on with your life and put Nina behind you.
- Why burden you with her health problems?
- Is that why you're here, Kate?
The minute we're done in New York, we need to be ready to move on Duncan and his team.
What about the Sanders family?
Make it a murder-suicide.
A weapon will be left in the father's hand, with a note, bemoaning his financial issues and marital problems.
It's never pleasant taking out innocent civilians, but we don't have a choice.
If I were them, I'd be looking to get some elevation.
Only a few structures in the vicinity have the heightened position to give you an angle on that alley.
The sniper team will be looking for a quick exit to a major thoroughfare.
- Don't know yet, but a sniper's only as good as his spotter, and a spotter is only as good as his vantage point.
How are we gonna get those?
After that doctor left, I started thinking about all those secrets I kept, for so long.
I got angry.
I've told my husband everything.
Kate, we had a deal.
He's a lot more powerful than he was 35 years ago.
I'll take my chances.
According to that doctor, there's no match for her bone marrow, right?
I want my daughter to know the truth before she dies.
We haven't given up.
Yeah, they do, but I can't access them whenever I want.
It's important to all of us.
Can't help you.
Both.
You still haven't learned anything, Brian.
You wanted to tell me something?
Here.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
Thank you for coming.
I was really surprised that you called me.
I thought you guys were in Montreal?
And then when he couldn't pay them back they, uh, they threatened to hurt our family.
Well, I don't think he wanted to get you involved.
He's out of town right now, but he really needs your help.
All I care about right now is protecting my family.
Your company access code.
We need the schematics for three buildings in New York.
For the business deal, just to help Brian dig himself out of this mess.
And why does the boy standing next to her have frosting all over his face?
So Nina was a tough one?
She still is.
According to the doctors, she should have been dead months ago.
I would have liked to have been a part of it.
But I'm glad she had you.
I just put all of this out of my head for so long.
You, Nina, Kincaid.
Now it's just rushing back, like a fresh wound.
And the enormity of what he did to all of our lives.
God, it just makes me so angry.
But in the end, we won.
You forged a new life!
What's up?
Was that his father?
No, his father and I don't talk.
- Sorry.
- Don't be.
I met him when I was working undercover in Mexico.
It didn't end well.
That's why I don't let my feelings interfere with business.
Where do you think they took Mom?
Why do they need building plans?
I'm not sure.
Then you should have just given them to him.
They put a bullet in me.
And I'm not going to let them defeat you.
It doesn't matter how many guns they have.
I understand.
I feel the same way.
I'm sorry we didn't get to spend more time together.
I just don't see why your trip to St. Theodore's should be off the record, Mr. President.
It's a great PR story.
A personal prayer visit to a church built by your great-grandfather?
That's a no-brainer to grab more of the Christian vote.
I spend 90% of my day on empty gestures, Ted.
Every once in a while, I have to do something that actually has meaning.
It's simply my nature.
But I try to make my peace with God, nevertheless.
Things move fast after an assassination.
You recall the chaos when Reagan was shot?
- And that was unsuccessful.
There's no direct money trail.
The team we have in place are professionals.
Money transfers will point to the involvement of a certain Middle Eastern country.
And the rumor mill will take it from there.
And my sister will never know the truth.
Not that she's ever been interested in it.
When will you move on the FBI agent and his team?
As soon as the operation is confirmed.
I want you to start monitoring his position.
It will set things up perfectly with the vice president.
- When are you speaking with him?
Are you confident you have his ear?
- Is there anything else I can do?
The way you're standing by him.
The way things were between us?
He told me that your marriage was a lie.
But clearly that's not the case.
They removed their batteries.
Start pulling up satellite imagery and running it through facial recognition.
Find them.
Why are we switching burners?
The one calling the shots isn't playing games.
If they win today, they'll be looking to get rid of us.
How do you know?
Because that's what I would do if I were in their shoes.
Kincaid will be here in exactly 72 minutes.
That's not enough time for a proper sweep on one of these buildings.
I'm not as big a believer.
Um, okay, trying to find it.
What the hell does it matter what glass coating?
They're inside the building, they're not scaling it.
The coating illuminates too much of the light passing through, it's going to be very hard for them to get an accurate view from that distance in the afternoon.
From street level it looks like it gives a vantage point, but it's built on a corner lot.
Just look for terms like anchor bolts, and rebars, stuff like that.
Building's out.
Then that's the building.
I know what to do.
Good luck.
I feel like I never get to see you anymore, Vanessa.
You were the best staffer I ever had.
A sacrifice of higher office.
You wanted to be vice president.
And as I recall, you're the one who advised me to do it.
Politics makes strange bedfellows.
It does indeed.
Which is why I want your counsel again.
As you might imagine, people are already beginning to strategize about the election two years from now.
So you've made up your mind to run when Kincaid's second term is up?
- It feels awfully early to think about.
- It's never too early.
Anybody you pick would be poison.
Since you were a governor, you can't add another person with a voting record to the ticket.
So where do I look?
Someone with instant name recognition, media appeal and non-partisan credentials.
You'll need international experience to bolster the ticket and, since you're from Texas, you'll need somebody who can deliver the coasts.
I know exactly who you're describing.
I'm not describing anybody in particular, just laying out the facts.
You were always the smartest person in the room.
The only question is, are you interested in running?
Kramer, remember snipers like to work in pairs.
Robert Harper will have a spotter.
Statistically, he's a white male, 20s, 30s.
- I got nothing.
Sandrine, I think we found the spotter.
Run room 3609, meet us at the car in five.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
I am.
Well, we might as well do it properly.
I'll go get out my video camera, and we'll tape your statement.
I never knew Nina was so much like her mother, so strong-willed.
I told her she could get hurt, and she did.
The thought of something happening to that girl terrified me.
All I wanted was to keep her safe.
And in that moment, I knew that there was nothing that I wouldn't do to protect her for the rest of her life.
Reconsider.
If she is going to die, let her go without knowing the whole, ugly truth.
If you like, I could talk to Nina.
We could change our arrangement.
You would let the two of us meet, face-to-face?
I'll, I'll wait.
You have no idea how glad I am you made that decision, Katherine.
Get behind the wheel and keep the motor running.
- 39 minutes.
Let's do it twice.
Clear!
That was the spotter.
Where's the shooter?
They aren't taking the hit from the hotel, they're just using it to get an eye on Kincaid.
Robert Harper, he's with another white male.
They're both wearing electric company uniforms.
- I've lost them.
- What do ya got?
- Look at this.
Hey, Logan, you're a real ball of personality, aren't you?
Sorry, Mr. President, I'm just trying to keep us on schedule.
Ah, we'll be fine.
Sir, I've got a hit on Duncan Carlisle in New York.
23rd and Broadway, 15 minutes ago.
Son of a bitch.
An electric company van parked there wouldn't draw any suspicion.
- Get over there now and take 'em out.
- Can't establish comm.
Kincaid's arriving.
Stay frosty, but I want this operation carried out.
Two Canadian passports.
One for you, one for your son.
You need to get to them, and take the shot.
No falling down on the job, Logan.
I think we promoted you a little too soon, son.
We gotta get out of here.
Targets are down.
Nice work.
Okay, let's go, sweetie.
We don't want to keep that driver waiting.
It's me.
Never lost faith that you could pull it off.
See you when you get back.
Looks like Aunt Leslie has the flu.
So, we won't be taking that trip, after all.
Then we'll go to the park, and then to the library!
They've been up there all day.
- Mom.
- Sweetheart.
- You helped them?
- Yeah, Samantha got them for me.
She says hi.
What are you guys talking about?
Nothing important, sweetheart.
I can't believe you did it.
You came through for me, Ellen.
To kill the president?
Thank you.
Don't move!
- Duncan, Archer and Kramer.
I need you to attach one to each vehicle.
How did your meeting go with the Vice President?
He said he would be lucky as hell to have someone like you as his running mate.
I need to tell him I won't do it.
I talked to Brian Sanders.
He told me what's going on, what you've done to his family, what you're planning.
Is Brian Sanders telling the truth?
Have you taken his family hostage?
Nina, you need to get back into bed and rest.
I didn't have a choice.
- This was the only way.
It didn't start there.
Right or wrong, I was willing to live with it.
If this is your miracle cure, I don't want it.
Sure it is.
What are you doing?
I'm getting the hell out of here.
The bombs are in place.
Has Duncan told you his exit plan?
We're meeting at a rest stop off I-95.
Two hours after the President is declared dead.
Duncan's gonna give us the wire transfer information there, we'll part ways.
When do I get my money and my passports?
Right after your partners are dead.
Right before would be better.
Trust isn't my strong suit.
Leaked the fact that you two are surveilling a federal prosecutor.
How do we know she's the leak?
I'm just saying, "Why?" Why would they be paying her to spy on us?
We want the same thing, but we are most definitely not on the same team.
When this is over, they're gonna try and take us out.
And Sandrine'll be the one who'll do it.
So as much as I like her, she's gotta go.
Duncan said that?
But we gotta figure out how she's planning to kill us before we make a move.
In the meantime, play it cool, act like everything's normal.
You gotta keep your feelings out of this, man.
It's just business.
So, you ready for this?
Yeah, but I want you to be there.
Absolutely.
But you raised me.
You're my father.
How could you not tell me the truth?
Then protect me now.
Fix this.
You're both insane.
I cannot believe this is actually happening.
Sawyer, honey, what are you doing up?
I heard all these people talking.
Mommy.
I don't care.
I'm just glad that you're out of the hospital.
That means that you're not sick anymore.
I'll take her.
She's the reason we're doing this.
She deserves to have a mother.
She deserves to have you in her life.
She deserves to have a father who's not a murderer.
I'm calling the police.
I'm ending it.
I'm sorry.
But you're not calling anyone.
You need to calm down.
- I need to get out of here.
You're not thinking clearly right now.
There's a lot to absorb.
I think you should stay here until this is over.
What are you doing?
Thank you, everybody.
Just kept it light and breezy.
Light and breezy can get you a long way in this town.
That's what I hear.
I'm going to meet my sister.
Doesn't like the idea of him going in to surgery, so, she wants to spend the day together.
She thinks I'm her good luck charm.
I think she might be wrong about that.
Everything's still on track?
I spoke with Duncan last night.
The future of this country will be in our hands.
- Where's Sandrine?
- You find anything?
The moment the President dies, he'll send me the account information.
Then let's make sure homegirl delivers.
Been a long few weeks.
That's not an option, Ellen.
Well, things have changed.
There are consequences to that decision.
And I am prepared to face them.
Look, I know you're doing this to save your wife.
And despite your threats, you're not gonna kill my kids.
I know it and you know it.
You're right.
I won't kill them.
But that doesn't matter.
Other people involved will.
I'm listening.
I'll find a way to get the President's bone marrow, if you protect my children.
I'm not sure that's even possible.
Okay.
But we want proof that you'll protect our kids.
What do you have in mind?
Only two days left, are you planning on a lot of wardrobe changes or something?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
We have a little time.
Not right now, sorry.
Well, if he's anything like his mother...
Look.
Sometimes... people do something in the moment that seems to make sense, but later on doesn't.
What are you saying?
If you made a mistake, I'd be willing to forgive you.
But Duncan and Archer... they wouldn't.
Can I help you?
Needs a little peace and quiet.
Your friend have a name?
Alex.
$60 a night, no smoking.
Can I help you?
I heard she just checked herself out of the hospital late last night?
She and her husband made the decision together.
She's probably sleeping.
Mr. Delaney, it's very important that I speak with your daughter.
I want her to go back to the hospital.
Grandpa?
Sawyer, please, I'm just finishing up with Mommy's doctor.
We're going to visit her later today, when she's feeling up to it.
Sorry to disturb you.
No, it's not a problem.
I was trying to help your mother.
Sometimes we have to say certain things that aren't true to protect the people we love.
Still got some work to do.
Yeah, I know.
But it's not illegal to dream, is it?
So about Sandrine, I've been thinking, it's not that easy to take out three armed men.
No matter how good you are.
What are you sayin'?
If I were them, I'd try to be more efficient.
We should check the cars.
I'll cut to the chase.
Is that right?
So, the reason I called you here, Colonel...
In your estimation, do you believe she's someone I can trust?
I don't even know where to begin.
You're in on this too.
How did they talk you into this?
We need to end it.
Look, I don't care what's already happened, there's nothing we can do about that.
Your father doesn't know you're alive.
And your very existence is a threat to him, to his whole hypocrisy.
I'm not very worried about him.
It's the same DNA.
She could bring him down just as easily as you could.
You're not making any sense.
He raped your mother 35 years ago, then tried to have her killed to cover it up, if he finds out the truth, he will eliminate any and all evidence that it ever happened.
That includes you and Sawyer.
So please, just stay here.
And let Duncan try to help you.
What are you guys doing?
I'm worried our partners might try to take us out when this is over.
No upside to letting us live, right?
Already did.
Maybe I should check the house again.
How'd it go?
- One day she'll thank us.
- You really think so?
I do.
I have to.
Otherwise, what's the point?
Let's get this done.
Get the family together.
We're not taking any chances.
I intend to honor that agreement.
Take 'em away.
Do you want me to kill the other one too?
This is what happens when you don't listen.
- What just happened?
Are we good to move?
I know Duncan is your friend, but maybe we should get out of this.
It already is.
Your friend won't have to leave for a week, just like you asked.
- Did it work?
- You did great.
Stay out of sight for the next two days, Jake.
Your mom and dad will send you a message on this phone with instructions on where to meet them when this is over.
What happens if something goes wrong and I don't hear from you guys?
They don't want to hurt us, but Archer and Sandrine are different.
Now we're going to get you out of here too, before I operate on the President, so you'll be safe no matter what.
You just need to keep it together a couple more days, can you do that?
Just promise me that we are going to be okay at the end of this.
About that private matter, sir.
Shut the door.
You asked me to let you know if there was anything unusual about Duncan Carlisle's personal or professional life.
Apparently she checked herself out of the hospital last night, suddenly, without her doctor's consent.
They're looking for her, but she's off the grid.
Nobody is off the grid to the NSA.
Your decision not to kill Kincaid has made everything more complicated.
It also creates a problem getting the bone marrow out of the hospital.
Logan was going to smuggle it out for us, but once he realizes the President's gonna live, Logan won't help us.
We need to find another way.
Hey baby, yeah, I'm awake.
Grandpa told me not to bother you.
No, no, you've been a really good girl.
I had a nice nap and I feel much better now.
Everything will be in place on the day.
He wanted to know if I thought you were trustworthy.
You're a very clever woman, Vanessa, but the game isn't over.
Where are you?
Why are we here?
You sure you don't want to wear a wire?
Want me to quiz you?
This has to work, so be patient.
How patient?
Wait for a gunshot.
Good.
Steve says you guys did some business a few months back.
Yeah, a few deals, we got to know each other a little bit.
That's why I came to you.
I'm flattered.
What I meant was we both share a similar philosophy about the government and the President.
I'm told you have a plan already in place.
I've been working on this for a few months, but I'm still shorthanded.
I need a few more smart, skilled men, and we can do the unthinkable.
We can take down the President of the United States.
Times, security codes, rotations, you name it.
That sounds good.
Too good.
Usually that means there's a cop involved.
We're gonna run your information, make sure you are who you say you are.
Please, just let her live somewhere else.
Away from you and all the craziness.
Donald Carter, huh?
Look, you don't wanna be a part of this, that's fine with me.
But I'm done answering questions.
Oh, I didn't give you permission to leave.
I don't ask permission.
So either you shoot me or I walk away.
I'm interested.
You got balls, man, I'll give you that, but it doesn't mean you're gonna be able to get close enough to the President to pull this off.
Now, it's all well and good to know the security plan.
What makes you think we can get past it?
I was hoping you'd ask that question.
Secret Service lapel pins.
They change color every day.
Those are the correct ones to get us past security the day after tomorrow.
Like I've been trying to say, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Billy doesn't know it yet, but he and his boys just signed up for a suicide mission.
They're the diversion.
Let's get the hell out of here.
You said you wanted to speak in private.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I think further testing would be the logical next step.
Have you spoken to Paul about this, and the White House physician?
Obviously this is a very sensitive issue in the case of the President.
If people find out he's being tested for any form of cognitive impairment, well, I assume that's the kind of thing you'd want to keep private.
As his doctor, I would feel irresponsible not recommending further testing.
Do you have an alternative proposal?
His upcoming surgery presents a unique opportunity.
I believe I could take a blood sample without drawing attention, but I would need help getting it out of the hospital into a private lab.
It would require someone who is capable of walking through security without being searched.
Someone like you, Madam First Lady.
Boone?
You see anybody else in here reading the newspaper?
Or anywhere else, for that matter.
It works like this.
In this envelope you will find new identities, documents, instructions, keys to a new house and a new life, but none of that will be worth a damn if you don't follow one simple rule.
Leave your past behind.
For how long?
I mean, I just got accepted into college.
You mean Morgan Sanders got accepted to college.
Morgan Sanders doesn't exist anymore.
Because you don't have a choice.
She called me from a payphone at DC National Station.
I'll call a friend at the Bureau.
Hey, Mike, how you doin'?
As you can imagine, I'd rather keep this off the record, but I need a hand in tracking them down.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Carlisle.
My name is Thomas Blair.
My father was an innocent man, destroyed by powerful people.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death...
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
You must go now.
I shouldn't have chosen Victoria over you.
Pre-Emily Thorne/ Amanda Clarke.
Emily announced that she's with child.
- I'm thrilled.
- She's lying.
Good-bye, Danny.
I'll slip it back into Victoria's closet before she ever knows about it.
Once it's covered in gunshot residue.
I'm sorry.
While I admire your determination, Ems, shouldn't getting Victoria to your wedding today be your sole focus right now?
I've come too far to let her win.
I'll be damned if she robs me of my wedding day.
You know, there are more direct ways of dealing with this problem.
She's not getting off that easy.
- I have a plan.
- And what's that?
Shouldn't you be getting ready?
To do what exactly, my dear?
Finally go down for the David Clarke frame-up?
Yeah, this list worked its way free from your bag while you were busy faking affection for me.
It's obviously my greatest weakness.
You're the beneficiary of Ms. Lemarchal's patronage, are you not?
I was.
I gather from the tenor of your text that all is not well this morning?
Victoria isn't attending the wedding.
Why is it the women in my life never cease to surprise and disappoint?
I know that she and I have had our differences, but to miss her son's wedding?
Well, you and your union have my full support, Emily.
And I'm sure their absence is amplified on a day such as this.
I do, Conrad.
And I know my father would share my feelings for you if he was still alive.
And perhaps he would've had some fresh insight on how to deal with Victoria.
But sadly, you are stuck with a man who has very little sway over his wife.
If only Patrick hadn't left.
Why?
Because he reminded her of the pain her absence can cause.
Maybe his presence would've changed her mind.
I guess he's gone.
So Victoria's attendance means that much to you?
I just want this day to be perfect, from start to finish.
Shouldn't you be getting ready?
Tux takes 10 minutes to get on, 12 depending on the cuff-links.
I think I even meant them.
It'd be much easier if you hated me right now.
And I would if I hadn't just booked two more gigs.
Enough, Danny.
I know you're used to getting your way, but you can't make everything okay for everyone.
Life doesn't work like that, even for you.
Congrats again.
Of course.
We have a 3:00 tee time, which will allow for cocktails at sunset.
I'll see you then.
Mom?
You stay away from my son.
I was hoping to use dear Patrick as incentive to change your mind about attending Daniel's wedding.
And that's why I came when Conrad reached out.
When Conrad reaches out, beware of what's in his hand.
I approach with open palm, Victoria, hoping to leave our grievances in the past.
Say "yes," Mom.
Okay, let's go over this one last time.
Then I will hide out and wait until exactly 10 past 9:00, when you should be approaching the buoy.
At which point, you will premiere the Grayson family slide show, which I nauseatingly prepared.
Then I'll make sure she's trapped, then await the sound of gunshots.
And I'll only fire once I've poured my blood on deck as evidence that she shot me.
Now you have exactly 20 minutes until the coast guard starts the search.
Retrieve the case from the buoy, use the mini scuba tank to get beneath the surface, catch the current, and meet me at the beach.
And under questioning, I guarantee that she'll roll on Conrad in an attempt to save herself.
Let's take down the Graysons once and for all.
You came to say good-bye?
About Amanda.
I was with her when she died.
What?
I held her in my arms, Jack.
And the last thing that she made me promise was that I would take care of you and Carl.
And you're just now saying this?
Why wait till now?
I know it's because you were just too busy protecting your plan.
Which I changed because you asked me to, because there was a time, Jack, when you were my best friend.
But look at what you've become and who you're turning me into.
You are so selfish.
You use everyone who cares about you.
I lost Amanda, too.
You've taken everything from me!
Even this moment.
I just hope that one day, you can understand why I needed to do this.
Good-bye, Jack.
You did well playing contrite for Conrad.
Well, I meant what I said, about bringing the family back together.
But the idea of you apologizing to that man is nauseating.
Well, it got me through the door, right?
I can't go down that road again.
Nor would I want you to.
We'll find more creative ways of dealing with Conrad.
I don't think I could ever bear the thought of losing you again.
You have nothing to worry about, Mom.
News travels fast.
I got your text.
Um, actually got all 40 of 'em over the past month.
With a zero percent response rate.
You really know how to make a guy feel special.
Patrick, I spent a lot of time wondering what the hell happened.
Nolan, I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
It's for the best.
Oh, funny that you should say that, because there's nothing honest about you, and I can finally prove it.
Ready for the "before"?
And there you are, Emily.
Looks just like you, but with a billion fewer dollars.
What do you want, Lydia?
For starters, I want my house back.
It helped being next door to land a Grayson, didn't it?
It's yours.
Just please, don't ruin my wedding day.
Leave the door unlocked.
It'll make it easier for me to move back in.
I heard about your slumber party last night.
Oh, that was a momentary lapse of reason-- not unlike our last approach to the altar.
Mrs. Grayson, how does it feel adding a new member to your family?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Patrick is a gentleman and the light of my life.
And today, we shall see where it lies.
I can't believe I'm gonna be an aunt again.
I'm sure it'll be a little girl.
And just think, she and Carl will grow up together, play on the beach.
I'm sure they'll be best friends.
Sounds wonderful.
I'm gonna go check and make sure my folks are here and give you some time alone.
I love you, too, my almost sister.
You look beautiful.
Though I imagine my admiring gaze isn't why you summoned me.
Lydia has evidence that could ruin me.
I'll take care of it.
Thanks.
Rohan did an exemplary job, though it's likely a wasted effort as there should be no reason to activate this emergency beacon.
May I?
After our rocky start, who would thought we'd end up here?
Only you could make vengeance so beautiful.
We are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage of Emily Rebecca Thorne and Daniel Edward Grayson.
If anyone has reason to object to their blessed union, please speak now or forever hold your peace.
I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list.
- Who the hell are you?
With this ring, I commit to you, to our child, and our future together.
I love you, Emily, now and always.
Daniel...
I've looked forward to this day since I was a little girl.
Thank you for letting me into your life, into your family.
The woman that I needed to be.
You may now kiss your bride.
I'm sorry.
It's our big day, and here I am, stressing about work.
Is that why you're drinking for the both of us?
Well, my dad opened a 64-year-old bottle of Glenlivet.
Grayson groom tradition.
Well, maybe you should slow down a bit.
We still have a boat ride to Nantucket ahead.
You, uh, have her for a lifetime.
You mind if I borrow her for 16 eight counts?
Well, she's all yours.
And it's such a shame the bride only has a few hours to live.
Did you handle the Patrick situation?
He shut me down, in favor of staying glued to mommy drearest's side.
Which is exactly why he can't get on that yacht.
He won't.
Trust me.
I do, with my life.
Long live David Clarke.
No, we need more intimate shots.
Hands-on, right down to the last detail.
Such dedication for an editor.
Don't make an enemy of me, Ms. Lemarchal.
Or what?
You'll destroy me like you destroyed so many others?
Oh, no, you see, such flagrant inaccuracies of my character.
Yet, you are so concerned.
Ah, rest assured, Lydia is no threat.
One romantic rendezvous with you and she was useless to me.
Is that so?
It's me.
Well, it's time to cut the cake.
Let's cut the cake.
Daniel hasn't uttered a word to me all day.
Well, give him some time.
At least he looks happy.
Emily's been kind.
Well, that's how I know she's up to something.
Excuse me.
Sara made a beautiful cake.
You don't have to say that.
I understand what it is to want closure.
I know you do things you never thought you would do.
Excuse me.
Have you come to kick me out of this suite, too?
I have not.
Then what, Conrad?
I'm not a simple man to be with, but I have a simple question.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Then I want you to have the life I promised years ago, with me.
And maybe it's time we shake things up in the Hamptons.
Let's.
Emily told me you almost didn't attend the ceremony.
What changed your mind?
Love for my son.
Well, I assume you mean Patrick.
Your brother's presence made this day bearable, but I came because I wanted to salvage our relationship, for everyone's sake.
Well, that's easy.
You can... accept Emily, accept that we're having a baby, and we're happy.
Yet, you're obviously self-medicating.
Where's Patrick?
I hope he'll be joining us on the yacht.
He went to the city to pick up a few things.
But he'll be arriving in Nantucket tomorrow.
Okay, last looks for hair and makeup.
We have a few shots here at the house and several more combinations as you board.
Need I remind you of our deal, Victoria?
If you want me to welcome Patrick back into the fold, you'll do the same for my companion.
- You duplicitous--
My associate said we had a deal.
What more do you want, Lydia?
I want you to get exactly what's coming to you.
Don't worry, boss.
I'm off the clock and a paying customer.
They've been playing this "happily ever after" crap on loop.
What about the cake?
That's gotta be a reason to celebrate.
I saw Danny this morning.
Dumb as hell, right?
Come on.
You're not gonna tell a stupid girl she's being stupid?
Well, you know, that kind of attitude just might get you laid tonight, Mr. Porter.
How about I call you a cab?
Thought my text would get your attention.
I know it was you that caused the crash.
The only reason that I brought up what you did was to bring you back.
You know, Victoria told me about how Conrad kept her prisoner in that marriage for years.
So I did something that I regret like hell.
I'm sure you can't possibly understand that.
I fight for the people that I love, too.
I can't just let that go.
Can I get everyone's attention, please?
I've been keeping a little secret from you all, even Daniel.
I put together a video of some of our Grayson celebrations over the past couple of years.
I wanted to screen it for you all now.
What are you talking about?
That was Sara's roommate.
Victoria, wait.
Have you come to help?
Well, I didn't even think to ask if you had club soda for this spill, since most bartenders do.
I'm done making mai tais.
Conrad's promised me a penthouse.
You don't love him, Victoria, so I don't know what you're going on about.
Besides, we both know you have far bigger concerns than me.
And they say no one ever thinks about the mother of the groom.
I thought I'd bring you a real drink, since I suspect you're about as pregnant as I am.
This photo proves that you've been targeting my family and my son for years.
Now who are you?
You'd like nothing more than for me to grab you by the throat so that you can say that I'm crazy.
You know, for once, you're not completely mad, Victoria.
Daniel needed a little last-minute incentive, so I stole from the master manipulator.
After all, isn't a fake pregnancy how you landed Conrad?
Well, the difference is that I believed I loved him.
But you're nothing but a predator.
What a sad, sad woman.
You are as worthless to me as this bracelet.
Good-bye, Victoria.
Two minutes and then fire.
I heard everything.
Captain, man overboard!
All hands on deck!
Where's Emily?
Where's Victoria?
Why don't you put on some music and, uh, come join me?
What are you doing here?
Don't worry.
I just wanna end things right with her.
Emily left this for me, but I think she should have it.
- It was Amanda's.
- She's not here?
The distress beacon has not been activated.
Then where the hell is she?
Oh, God.
And that if you don't believe it, take a close look.
And if you still don't, look closer.
Need a lift?
I don't need your help!
You're running out of branch there, buddy.
Still don't need your help.
You're not the only one on this team, you know.
You've got your own problems.
Get a bird and get back to Moonhaven, or you're done.
What, you're not going to help me now?
I just did.
That's cool!
She talks!
Something on your mind, kid?
What do you say to a total stranger?
I'm leaving you out here with someone you don't know?
Maybe now things will be different.
Anyone home?
No, that's right there.
Hi, Dad.
You're here!
I didn't realize today was today.
It always is.
Hey, let me look at you!
You look just like your mother.
Thanks, but I've been reading up on the five stages of grief.
There actually are a few things I would like to talk about.
Ozzy, go say hi.
Here, boy!
There he goes.
Well, here we are.
Welcome home.
It's like I never left.
All your things are here, you got your dolls and... your pictures, your turtle.
Oh, dear.
It's good to have you back, Mary Katherine.
Actually, I go by MK now.
You probably want some time to settle in.
I'm just going to let you make yourself at home, Mary Kather--
Come on, Mom, you're going to miss them.
Queen Tara, we need to discuss today's ceremony.
Yes, it's Ronin.
I think he looks silly kneeling, too, but I can't get him to stop doing it.
I think the Boggans are scouting our defenses.
You know they'd do anything to stop you from choosing an heir.
But don't worry, I've got a plan.
When we were kids he wasn't so serious.
Would you like to hear my plan?
And he had the sweetest smile.
Yes, I feel this is a bad idea.
The Boggans have never been this aggressive.
I'm not completely helpless, you know.
I am aware.
Is that the only reason you do it?
Isn't that reason enough?
If that's the only reason there is.
I'm not ticklish.
You used to be!
I don't think I saw a salute, Boggan!
We had a little skirmish with some Leafmen this morning.
A rat got caught in the crossfire... so I got a new coat.
It's, uh, just like yours!
Did you find the location of their ceremony?
Yes, sir!
It's way outside of our borders.
You mean their borders?
The Leafmen think they can keep us contained... surround our beautiful island of rot... with their hideous green forest.
So arrogant!
All in the name of balance.
I'm sick of balance.
No matter how much of the forest we destroy... the queen regrows it with one wave of her hand.
Today we'll show them you just can't stop the rot.
If the queen dies without an heir... the Leafmen can't regrow anything.
I know you won't.
You look good in rat.
Here comes your star pupil.
Where have you been?
Wait, you're mad?
And you want credit for that?
I'm trying to help you, I'm trying to look out for you.
Not anymore!
Everyone, mount up!
Hold on, I'll be right down!
Fetch the camera!
Why do you have security cameras, anyway?
No, I have an extensive network all through the forest, yeah.
Well... your mother had a wonderful sense of humor.
Isn't that cool?
Okay... if tiny men are flying around in the forest... how come I've never seen them?
Didn't you ever wonder why it was so hard to swat a fly?
So, no matter how fast we think we are... to them we're just big and dumb and... slow.
Okay, we need to talk.
I know it's a lot to take in.
I mean about us.
Here, I made this for you.
I'm just going to investigate, rather--
You have to catch these things in the moment... while they're happening... otherwise you miss a chance that could be gone forever.
I promise!
In reality.
Bye, Ozzy.
It's not you.
Play dead!
How are you so fast on three legs?
Isn't she pretty?
She's awesome!
She moved those trees with her mind!
Mom, can I be queen when I grow up?
Honey, it doesn't work that way.
Today, Queen Tara gives her power to a special Pod... so the life of the forest will continue.
It's all very mysterious, and--
Sweetie, what are you doing?
Did what?
She's coming!
Don't do anything to embarrass me... or it could ruin my chances of being a Leafman.
Why do you want to be a Leafman?
You see this, you see that?
Mub, Grub, it's a very nice-looking group of Pods.
Really gone back and forth.
You'll note the carefully curated selection of sizes, densities, color.
Well, that's one way to go.
Boggans.
I told you she was awesome!
Oh, come on, Ozzy.
Nice one!
You're stealing my moves, kid!
You're totally my hero!
Okay... so maybe you were right.
Remind me to gloat later.
Oh, my gosh, that's an arrow.
Should I pull it out?
I don't know what to do.
Take the Pod to Nim Galuu.
It's the life of the forest.
So serious.
I'm so sorry.
What did she say to you?
The scroll keeper.
Mandrake will be looking for this Pod... but he won't be looking for a Leafman traveling alone.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
I'll send word when I reach Nim's.
Who are you people?
Is this some sort of reenactment?
That's a big bug.
Especially when it's attached to something so lovely.
Talking snails.
We are the official Pod caretakers, sir.
It can't survive without us.
We keep it moist.
Moist is what we do.
You're kidding.
You're not kidding.
Of course.
By any chance... you don't happen to be part of an advanced society... of tiny people living in the woods, do you?
Some are more advanced than others.
I'm telling you, this is where I belong!
You belong in the back of the pack!
That's a dirty trick, which, let's face it, is exactly what we've come to see.
Final lap!
This is bird racing, folks, it's not a parade.
I don't know, lose?
Is that the best you've got?
How was that?
Yeah, I like you, too, Mr. Bufo.
And yet, you don't do what we agreed.
We agreed that you would lose, but then you win.
Now, I can't help it if I'm fast.
Maybe if you understood that... the Leafmen wouldn't have kicked you out.
I admire your independent spirit, Nod, I'll miss that.
No, snakes just swallow you whole.
Now, if you put him in a hornets' nest, that's a show.
Look, it's Ronin, defender of the weak... pooper of parties, here to ruin the fun.
Hop along now, little froggy.
Ronin, I don't know what to say.
She was your...
I'm sorry.
What's going to happen to us, to the forest?
If we don't get the Pod to Nim Galuu's, the forest will die.
This doesn't make any-- I mean, it makes sense.
Mary Katherine, you're not gonna believe these readings... they are off the charts!
Ozzy, what are you doing outside?
Great, because this whole bird-riding thing's new to me.
Are you serious?
Okay, but you're gonna want to hold on to something.
What is wrong with you?
Do you know how hard it is to do that without falling?
I do now!
Nod, perch your bird.
Hey, I'm just trying to keep things... light.
What did that?
Mandrake.
Tara's power always kept him in check.
We have to go around.
Just for one scout?
-Still barely know you.
This way!
What was that thing?
What, you've never seen a Boggan?
You mean up there with those things?
They almost killed us.
Don't turn around.
Is it a Boogie?
Walk towards me slowly.
What are you doing?
Look at its little hands and its little whiskers.
Oh, great.
Fuzzy mousie.
They have very sensitive whiskers.
There were talking slugs and tiny little soldiers and--
New seating arrangement.
You're riding with me.
Thank you.
You're with the slugs.
Disgusting.
Do you and me have a problem?
I don't think so.
What are we talking about?
There's a code amongst men.
Look at yourself!
Oh, that's right, you can't... because your eyeballs are stuck all the way inside your head.
Do you want me to call your flatface mommy?
Hey, if this is a bad time... I can come back when you're done gardening.
I imagine you're wondering why I invited you here.
I was frog-marched here at spearpoint.
How is that invited?
I let you keep your legs.
There are rumors that the Leafman Ronin was at your place of business... and that he may have rescued a Royal Pod.
Real smooth.
You got rid of the queen, but let her Pod get away.
Plus your idiot general gets himself mulched.
That idiot general... was my son!
Of course he was.
Shut up!
What's it gonna be, Bufo?
Where are they taking the Pod?
It's clear.
Why is he even with us?
"Many leaves, one tree."
What does that mean?
Maybe you're connected, but I'm kind of on my own.
No one's on their own.
Not even him.
Hey, Nod, how's the view?
Well... here we are.
I thought this was a secret Leafmen mission.
How many people did the queen tell about this?
They're here looking for answers.
Nobody knows that the queen is gone... only that the blight is spreading.
So, this Nim guy can tell them?
He's the keeper of our history... but even he may not know about the queen.
But he'll help, right?
He's, like, the wise old man of the forest.
He's more like the crazy uncle.
I grew up in that meadow.
Why isn't the queen doing anything?
If anything happened to her, everything's going to rot!
Get a hold of yourself!
Prepare to see your worries... disappear.
I know rumors have been flying... but the truth is never as bad as it seems.
I have just returned from deep inside this tree... from the Rings of Knowledge... where every memory... every event that ever happens in the forest... is recorded in these scrolls.
What?
-Just tell us what it says!
I know, but--
The queen's last words were "Bring the Pod to Nim Galuu."
Magic might be stretching it.
The Rings of Knowledge!
And you've read all these scrolls?
I've skimmed them.
Is this?
Yes.
How about this?
Yes.
What about this?
Yep.
That should be it right here.
Thanks, Marty.
Well, good news is, once the queen chooses it... it's going to bloom no matter what.
But it has to open tonight... in the light of the full moon when it's at its highest peak.
Yep, solstice... full moon, highest peak, mentions it a bunch of times.
What happens if it blooms out of the moonlight?
Unclear.
The last part's missing.
I gotta be honest, termites have been a problem.
So here I thought we were doomed.
This calls for a celebration!
I suppose we've earned it.
And I thought maybe something in these scrolls could tell me... if there's a way for me to get home.
The scrolls don't tell the future... they only guide us with the knowledge of the past.
Hey, that's a great line!
You guys got that, right?
I can't read this.
Come closer.
This is perfect!
It's a memory.
If you can hear me now... it means you got to Nim's.
I know you're scared.
Just stay with the Pod... be with it when it blooms... and then you'll get back what you've given.
Well, that was intense.
I gotta read more of these.
That means I can get home!
Well, if you want to go home so bad, then why did you leave?
Lose the sword, Ronin, we're done.
We're not done until the Pod blooms.
We're bringing it home to Moonhaven.
I need you to watch it while I tell the rest of the Leafmen to expect us.
Hey, I helped you get here, but I haven't changed my mind.
Do you think just because you're not a Leafman anymore... you're not a part of this?
The fate of that Pod affects all of us.
Tonight, when this Pod blooms, a new queen will rise!
You're not from around here, are you?
You wanna go somewhere quieter?
Will that be okay with Ronin?
Yeah, he said to watch the Pod... but there's nowhere safer than Nim's tree.
Put your arms around me.
But I barely know you.
Do you want to ride him or not?
The scroll said there was nothing you could do to save her, Ronin.
You have to know that.
Or just do the first part.
I gotta admit, flying is nice, but this is riding in style.
You have to be gentle to ride a deer.
Fruit fly, huh?
So, what's it like, having such a short life cycle?
The forest trembles at the passing of the humble fruit fly.
You found it!
Well, we're the only ones that know how to keep it that way.
Thanks for the tip.
Stay with the Pod, that's all you had to do.
We're really sorry, okay?
I don't want to hear it.
I'll do whatever it takes to help you get it back.
I appreciate the offer, but Wrathwood is too dangerous.
Nim, tell him.
So if no one has a better plan--
Why don't we sneak in, in disguise?
Well?
You might want to hang on.
Your stories are boring and torturous!
It's basic etiquette.
An eye for an eye.
It will become my little dark prince.
I'll destroy the forest with the very thing you hoped would save it.
I hate to break it to you, but it doesn't say that in the scrolls.
It does in the part I have.
Hey, the Boggan armor... where is it?
Come on.
That was awesome.
That is some static cling.
No, that's metal, don't touch that!
Come on.
You know... some of this stuff looks familiar.
Hey, that's my saddle!
Where are we?
Oh, it's where this guy lives.
Like us, but big and dumb and slow... always stomping on things.
One of his ginormous, flabby, dirty, stinky--
Okay, I got it.
So we've been throwing him off the trail.
So you're just messing with him?
But he's found all this stuff.
He only finds what we want him to find.
Look at his map.
We've got him looking everywhere but where we are.
I love how this guy talks.
"Look at this flower."
"I hurt my elbow."
It's his life's work.
He's my dad!
He what?
I'm a stomper.
Which he knows.
Seriously?
It's been a weird day for everybody.
You got a problem with stompers?
Too far?
Try it again, maybe she'll punch you harder.
I'm sorry.
I guess she's right about me, huh, Ozzy?
All I seem to be able to do is... drive people away.
No, Dad, you didn't!
Ozzy... no kisses.
Hey, how do I look?
Scary as ever.
Are you okay?
Run!
Ozzy, will you please stop?
Come on, MK, we gotta go.
You think he's okay?
Yeah, he'll be fine, their heads are like rocks.
Smart rocks.
That's a whole lot of ugly.
How do we know where to go?
I've been here before... with your father.
He never told me about this.
He never got the chance.
Nothing.
There's our exit.
Follow the slime.
Aren't you coming with us?
I'm gonna make sure nobody follows you.
Hey, look!
Let's go.
When I get big again, I am so coming back here with a can of bug spray.
We're down here!
I told you she'd come for me.
This girl is smitten.
Hand me the Pod!
Can you go any faster?
It's kind of hard when you're pulling on my brain!
Who said I'm alone?
So, what's the plan here?
Don't flatter yourself.
Well, now I'm just embarrassed.
I completely over-prepared.
Go, go, go!
I'm afraid you'll find getting out... is a lot harder than getting in.
I'm not leaving without you!
Now you're starting to sound like a Leafman!
Come on!
He gave us a head start.
But the Boggans aren't far behind.
You got that from the scrolls?
Some things you just know.
Do you know what this means?
We single-handedly saved the forest!
Eye five!
So, when the Pod opens, what happens to you?
I think I go home.
Mandrake's bats!
They're not attacking, they're just blocking out the moon.
Are you ready for this?
What are you doing?
Isn't that what you want?
So I should just sit here?
I didn't say that.
Then I'm going up there.
I didn't say that either.
You don't even know what you're saying.
That's my girl.
Oh, come on!
They're all right about me, Ozzy.
All these years just chasing things that aren't even there.
I actually thought I saw my daughter, two inches tall, stuck in a bug jar.
I've lost my mind.
And I am talking to a dog.
Just check your cameras!
I am so over Boggans.
Dad!
Don't faint!
I won't!
How did you find me?
I got your message.
You were right.
About what?
Me, too.
How did you get so small?
And they need your help.
Follow me!
Missed me.
I wasn't aiming for you.
Shut up!
Seriously, I lost count.
Well, what's one more?
It's so beautiful.
There's no time!
But what matters most is--
Not now!
They really do go in your hair!
This time, when I leave you for dead... you'll stay that way!
What's that little saying you people have?
"Lots of leaves, something-something"?
Very inspiring.
But in the end every leaf falls and dies alone.
No one is alone.
Not even him.
Look after them for me.
There's that smile.
Your Majesty.
You look terrible.
Hey, did you see how many times I got hit?
I learned that from you.
I was a pretty poor substitute.
Don't beat yourself up.
Lately you've shown some real promise.
I thought we just did.
Hey, you're still here.
What's happening?
It's working!
We have to say goodbye!
What for?
You're part of us.
Many leaves, I always say.
I mean, the Leafmen say.
Not that I'm a Leafman.
Says who?
I will, Mub.
You're really leaving.
Put your arms around me.
I always hoped if I... if I proved it to her... she'd... you know.
Well, what do you think?
It's perfect, Dad.
Really?
They should seriously consider the potential.
No, it's not work when you love your job.
Hi, Mub.
We were talking.
There's a big sack of "shut your flat face" over there by that tree.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Listen, slick.
Guys, don't fight.
It won't be a fight.
I could whip him with both eyes behind my back.
I'd like to see you try, jelly butt.
I didn't want to have to do this!
Mub, get him out of your mouth!
Dad, I gotta go Heimlich my friend out of a slug.
Tell them about the acorn helmets.
Or you could tell them yourself.
Come on, Ozzy!
Looks distinguished and debonair to me.
Let them laugh.
It's not a crime to be away for a few days, Martin.
And I'll pay all the bills for us, especially the mortgage for our very own house.
Perfect.
To this undeterred hero for justice, the Nobel Committee of Oslo, Norway, awards our 1964 Peace Prize.
I accept this honor for our lost ones, whose deaths pave our path.
I accept this honor for the more than 20 million American Negroes who are motivated by dignity.
I got my hair pressed that same morning and it was wasted as soon as I hit the water.
I should have worn a swim cap like Mama said.
Wonder what old Dunn'll say when I tell him one of his gals is down here stirring a fuss.
Sixty-seven.
Name them.
Mr. President, Dr. King.
Proudest moment of my life, I tell you.
Let's not start another battle when we haven't even won the first.
I'm calling it "The War on Poverty."
It's a matter of political priorities.
Poverty is going to be my focus at home and I want you to help me with this.
This voting thing is just gonna have to wait.
And you know the astounding fact that not one of these criminals who murder us when and why they want has ever been convicted.
Yeah, I know we have a lot of work to do down there.
All-white because you can't serve on a jury unless you are registered to vote.
Selma it is.
Big speech lined up for these folks tonight, Doc?
I can only imagine.
Decent-looking place to die though.
Good afternoon.
This way, Dr. King.
I heard he was assaulted in Selma.
My information can be summed up in a few words.
What I need to know right now is what's he about to do next?
Mr. President, you know we can shut men with power down permanently and unequivocally.
I'm very aware of that, Mr. Director.
Well, if you prefer a different approach, we can go with the wife.
We know there's tension in the home already.
We can weaken the dynamic.
Dismantle the family.
Same thing?
When are you all heading out?
I see.
This local Sheriff Jim Clark is supposed to be bad business.
Won't go down without a fight, they say.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.
It just takes the edge off.
Martin.
I need to hear the Lord's voice.
Uncle Marty!
Hey, Richie Jean!
Oh, yeah, that's a long story.
Ain't you supposed to be on a diet?
I wanted to tell you that the students are in town.
Don't be surprised if they don't give us grief tomorrow.
They're young and full of spirit.
Not a bad thing.
It'll sort out.
One struggle ends just to go right to the next and the next.
If you think of it that way, it's a hard road.
We must do this!
We see children become victims of one of the most vicious crimes ever perpetrated against humanity within the walls of their own church!
They say to us, to all of us, all colors and creeds, that we must do this.
They say to us that it is unacceptable for more than 50% of Selma to be Negro and yet less than 2% of Negroes here being able to vote and determine their own destiny as human beings.
They say to us that the local white leadership use their power to keep us away from the ballot box and keep us voiceless.
No more!
Respectfully speaking, of course, we've been handling the voter registration in this town now for two years.
John.
And on our best days, our adversary helps the matter by making a mistake.
Now, we were in Albany for nine months and we made a lot of mistakes.
But their sheriff, Laurie Pritchett, he never made a mistake.
Kept his cool, kept arresting us in a humane way, carried people to the jail-wagons on stretchers.
But what we do is negotiate, demonstrate, resist.
Right now, Johnson has other fish to fry and he'll ignore us if he can.
The only way to stop him doing that is by being on the front page of the national press every morning and by being on the TV news every night.
And that requires drama.
John.
In the courthouse sits the heart of the matter, the voter registration office.
Segregation is now illegal in this country, sir.
Now, I stand here today in the cradle of the Confederacy to remind its people of our Founding Fathers' goals of duty.
Goals long since forgotten by progressives and liberals in favor of what they call a changing world.
Yeah, but what is the prize, friend?
What happens when a man stands up and says enough is enough?
And what happens to the people he led?
What are we doing, Ralphy?
This cell is probably bugged.
It probably is.
They're gonna ruin me so they can ruin this movement.
They are.
"Are you not worth much more than they?"
Yes, sir.
Holy shit.
Are you all right?
I wish I had more time to prepare is all.
I prefer to be prepared.
Yes, I understand that.
Sometimes I wish I were more out there in the trenches.
You do more than you know, Mrs. King.
Please do, Mrs. Boynton.
I know that we are descendants of a mighty people, who gave civilization to the world.
They've prepared you.
You are already prepared.
I have no army behind me anymore.
I have myself and the truth.
That is all I stand on today.
But because we don't agree, Mrs. King, does not mean that I'm the enemy.
What do you intend to say to these people then, sir?
A lot of work has been done here, and I don't intend to see it undone tonight.
Let my being here, Mrs. King, represent the factions that will come if they don't give the good reverend what he's asking for and soon.
Do you know what he has said about us in the past, Coretta?
Said on national television that the white man pays me to keep Negroes defenseless.
The white man pays me!
How could you allow it?
Actually changed?
I'm tired.
You're right.
Johnson is going to get jumpy.
Now he's playing into their hands.
Sir?
Dr. King.
There are no words to soothe you, Mr. Lee.
There are no words.
But I can tell you one thing for certain.
He say, "Pa, you gonna vote before you done."
Always good.
Jimmie gone.
I'm so sorry.
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?
We know a state trooper acting under the orders of George Wallace pointed the gun and pulled the trigger.
But how many other fingers were on that trigger?
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?
Every white lawman who abuses the law to terrorize.
Every white politician who feeds on prejudice and hatred.
Every white preacher who preaches the Bible and stays silent before his white congregation.
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?
Every Negro man and woman who stands by without joining this fight as their brothers and sisters are humiliated, brutalized, and ripped from this earth!
But today, Jimmie, we're doing the living and you've done the dying, dear brother.
What are the specific hardships and humiliations we can address within the larger context of legislation?
Nobody you know, not a single black person for 100 miles is registered.
A march from Selma to Montgomery to protest and amplify.
Well, I'll be damned.
This was always part of the plan, wasn't it?
Provoke some tragedy in little old Selma, then go big.
Get someone killed and march on the State Capitol!
Selma to Montgomery's gotta be 50 miles!
You march those people into rural Alabama unprotected, it's gonna be open season.
It's too damn far and too damn dangerous!
What do you want, Mr. President?
The same high-level that's been tracking us like animals?
This all feels very convenient.
Not gonna happen, Lee.
Meet me halfway on this, Martin.
I can't, Mr. President.
Can't or won't?
Mr. President, how did it go?
What can I do to help?
Get me J. Edgar Hoover.
King, you know you are a complete fraud and a liability to all nigras.
Your degrees and your fancy awards will not save you.
The American public will soon know you for what you are, an evil, abnormal beast.
That wasn't me.
That isn't me, Corrie.
I know.
I know what you sound like.
I've gotten used to a lot.
Without the things the children should have, all because of how it would look.
I have gotten used to it, for better or worse.
But what I have never gotten used to is the death.
The constant closeness of death.
It's become like a thick fog to me.
I can't see life sometimes because of the fog of death constantly hanging over.
People actually say that they will stop the blood running through the hearts of our children.
That's what they said on the other end of that phone line.
If I ask you something, will you answer me with the truth?
Good, because I am not a fool.
Do you love me?
Yes, I love you, Coretta.
Do you love any of the others?
I need to put the march back a day.
Why?
I have to be home right now.
We can start it off from Selma, and you can join in on the second day.
I just think it'd be a mistake to hold people back when their blood is up.
I don't know, Andy.
It'll be just fine.
One of us walks.
Your lives could be in danger, but we're going to be strong if we stick together.
This is Alabama.
It's been voted on and decided.
For this march, you're on your own with De Lawd and his disciples.
About 525 Negroes had left Brown's Chapel and walked six blocks to cross Pettus Bridge and the Alabama River.
There were young and old, and they carried an assortment of packs, bed rolls and lunch sacks.
Can you swim?
Not many swimming pools for black folk where I come from.
We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin from CBS News.
This is an unlawful assembly.
You have two minutes to disperse.
Go home or go to your church.
This march will not continue.
Two minutes.
May I have a word with the Major?
There's no word to be had.
Major Cloud, may we speak with you?
Troopers, advance!
Seventy million people are watching this.
The first 10 or 20 Negroes were swept to the ground screaming, arms and legs flying, packs and bags went skittering across the grassy divider.
Those still on their feet retreated.
A cheer went up from the white spectators lining the south side of the highway.
The troopers continued pushing, using both the force of their bodies and the prodding of their nightsticks.
Suddenly, there was a sharp sound, like a gunshot, and a gray cloud spewed over the troopers and the Negroes.
But before the cloud hid it all, there were several seconds of unobstructed view.
Fifteen or 20 nightsticks could be seen through the gas, flailing at the heads of the marchers.
The Negroes cried out as they crowded together for protection, and the whites on the sidelines whooped and cheered.
From the hospital came reports of victims suffering fractures of ribs, heads, arms and legs.
And Negro leader John Lewis, despite injury from a possible skull fracture, led the marchers back to the chapel after the encounter with officers.
Hey, hey, hey, what you need guns for?
We won't win that way, and I ain't talking about the Bible.
We're going back to the bridge.
We're going to finish this, we promise you that, Ms. Amelia.
We go again.
While rageful violence continues towards the unarmed people of Selma, while they are assaulted with tear gas and batons like an enemy in a war, no citizen of this country can call themselves blameless, for we all bear a responsibility for our fellow man.
I am appealing to men and women of God and goodwill everywhere, white, black and otherwise.
We need you to stand with us.
Judge Johnson, Dr. King's call-to-action was nationally televised.
We've seen hundreds of people travel across the country to attend tomorrow's march, mostly white, mostly clergy of some kind.
The SCLC is seeking a federal court order enjoining the state authorities from interfering with the next march.
You're asking me to overturn the Governor's mandate and to do so without a hearing, but it's not going to happen at all without a proper proceeding.
Dr. King is in position to lead tomorrow's march, Judge.
I will not oppose Wallace against protocol.
"Thousands head south in moral crusade."
The SCLC already filed an appeal against Wallace's orders this morning.
You want my advice, Mr. President?
You have to ask?
Give King the march to Montgomery.
Do that, and then Selma's over.
These pictures are going around the world, Lee.
Either King stops and Wallace stops, or I'll stop 'em both.
I'm here on the President's order to try and make this work.
Please work with me.
Maybe we can make a deal.
What if I could assure you that the administration would endorse a later march if tomorrow is called off?
The decision is with your side, sir, not ours.
Tell me, why have you traveled here, Mr. Reeb?
I'm so glad we're here together today.
Troopers, withdraw!
We've been going round and round on this for hours, and nothing's gonna change the fact that it was Doc's decision and we have to support him.
I don't know what it was.
That was no trap!
He made the wrong goddamn call!
Calm down, brother.
I'd rather people be upset and hate me than be bleeding or dead.
And I have done this to myself, to us.
At this late hour, my thoughts are of you and all you have sacrificed for this struggle.
I pray for discernment and guidance as we journey on.
I pray, too, that I can justify the faith you once had in me.
I, too, often feel that heavy fog you spoke of, Corrie.
Only you and our family clears the haze.
Love, Martin.
He betrayed trust.
He called, we came, and he didn't fulfill his own call.
God is guiding you.
I think that's what happened to Dr. King up there on the bridge today.
White niggers.
Doc, someone's been hurt.
A priest, from Boston.
White.
Now you know what being a nigger around here feels like, boy.
Dead.
I need a phone!
Chicago, Detroit, Boston, I don't care.
I wanted to speak privately.
I know there's been trouble with the group, and I apologize that our efforts have caused a rift between y'all.
That's a painful thing, I know, and I'm truly sorry it's happened.
Yeah, painful.
LBJ is not moving, John.
We have to move beyond these protests to some real political power.
This can't go on forever like this.
I can't go on like this.
Jessie was unconscious, and they just kept beating on him and beating on him.
I must've passed out on the asphalt somewhere.
And I was feeling down, but you got up there.
You remember that day at all?
I don't think we remember it the same way.
What'd I say, John?
And you know what else you said?
Now, Ms. Cooper and Ms. Boynton are here, and they need to be ready.
You're here.
Yes, I'm here.
I'm glad.
The fact of the matter, Your Honor, is that the incidents that occurred cannot be disputed.
These particular circumstances will paint a thorough picture of the horrific events endured in Selma.
Very well, you may proceed.
Mr. King, you went out on that bridge in direct violation of that judge's orders.
You deliberately disobeyed this judge and the Governor, did you not?
Thousands of people came to Selma, aroused by Sunday's brutal acts exacted by officials of the city of Selma and the state of Alabama.
It seems basic to our constitutional principles that the extent of the right to assemble, and demonstrate and march along the highway in a peaceful manner ought to be commensurate with the enormity of the wrongs that are being protested and petitioned against.
In this case, the wrongs are enormous.
Good day, gentlemen.
Well, Harry is chartering a plane himself.
Unfortunately, all my maneuvers have been put on hold while the matter's being adjudicated.
Governor, you wanted to talk.
They're protesting about the right to vote and the way they're treated in your state.
So that's your problem, your responsibility, and it's on your watch.
Mr. President, I disagree.
George, why are you doing this?
Well, 'cause you can't ever satisfy them.
George, you seen all those demonstrators out front of the White House keeping my Lady Bird awake the whole damn night?
And I don't have to draft bills or force the issue.
You agree they got the right to vote, don't you?
Now, don't shit me about who runs Alabama.
I don't have any legal power over the county registrars, Mr. President.
You and I'll be both dead and gone by then.
I don't right care what they think, and you shouldn't neither.
I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy.
At times, history and fate meet at a single time in a single place.
So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.
There, long suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans.
Rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself.
The issue for equal rights for the American Negro is that issue.
For this issue, many of them were brutally assaulted.
The Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or color.
To correct the denial of this fundamental right, this Wednesday, I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate these illegal barriers.
The bill will strike down voting restrictions in all elections, federal, state and local.
Well, if Wallace will see us when we arrive, there'll be no need for a speech.
Can you arrange that?
I don't want to see this go wrong for you.
Don't you want to protect yourself, Doctor?
Let me try to do that.
I'm just asking you to allow us to help you do that.
I'm no different than anybody else.
I want to live long and be happy.
We're here for a reason, through many, many storms.
But, today, the sun is shining, and I'm about to stand in its warmth alongside a lot of freedom-loving people who worked hard to get us here.
We heard them say they'd stop us, if it was the last thing they did.
We are here, and we ain't gonna let nobody turn us around.
And we embrace this new energy so boldly, embody it so fervently, that its reflection illuminates a great darkness.
Our society has distorted who we are.
From slavery to the Reconstruction to the precipice at which we now stand, we have seen powerful white men rule the world while offering poor white men a vicious lie as placation.
And when the poor white man's children wail with a hunger that cannot be satisfied, he feeds them that same vicious lie.
A lie whispering to them that regardless of their lot in life, they can at least be triumphant in the knowledge that their whiteness makes them superior to blackness.
But we know the truth.
We know the truth, and we will go forward to that truth, to freedom.
We will march to demand treatment as full citizens.
We will march until the viciousness and the darkness gives way to the light of righteousness.
Whether Jimmie Lee Jackson or James Reeb, or four blameless little girls struck down before they had even begun.
"Glory!
"His truth is marching on."
First, the rules.
You can never, ever play alone.
To start, you circle the board once for each player.
Then we say, "As friends we gather, hearts are true."
"As friends we gather, hearts are true."
Is someone here with us?
Debbie, cut it out!
If a ghost is here, you can see them through the planchette.
It's the eye to the other side.
If someone is here with us, make yourself known.
What are you guys doing?
Get out of here, Sarah!
Goodbye.
- Laine, hey.
It's just been a little rough this week.
- We're gonna be late for the game.
I'll be right out, just give me a sec.
What's going on?
- No, nothing like that.
Then what is it?
- Nothing.
- Debbie, tell me.
Remember that game we used to play, where you ask questions about the future?
A couple of weeks ago, I played it.
Just messing around and...
That is just a game.
- Just a total and complete spaz.
You're right, I'm being crazy.
Look, I don't even have to go to the basketball game.
I mean, my folks are gonna be home any minute, and I'm just being dramatic, and everything is fine.
Are you sure you don't wanna come?
I have leftovers inside, I'm gonna rock it out, but I will see you in the morning, that's for sure.
No.
I have a surprise for you.
Check this out.
But I thought this was your big camping trip with the guys.
I know, but I started thinking about it and I realized I'd miss you too much.
Where's Debbie?
So, what time are we hitting that party tonight?
Yeah, me showing up alone, that's not really a good look for me.
Look at her acting like she's not the one who breaks up with every guy she goes out with.
- I can't help it, I'm a picky bitch.
What's up?
- What's going on?
It's about Debbie.
Nona, can I talk to you?
I don't think I can go in.
She's still here.
She's right here.
Here.
I just don't understand.
None of us can.
We'll never know.
I wish she would have talked to us about whatever it was.
I know what the police say, but I can't believe she'd ever...
And that Carol found her like that, it's just horrible.
They're packed and coming to stay with me.
Can't be in this house another night.
Pete.
Laine.
I brought flowers.
Laine.
I just wanted to be in her room.
It's okay.
The hours you two spent in here.
And by fifth grade, you'd picked out your college.
She used to draw pictures of... of what our dorms would look like.
Everything was purple.
Yeah, I remember that.
Her purple phase.
Thank you for watching the house while we're gone.
I don't know when we'll be back.
Here.
I put these things together for you.
She'd want you to have them.
Always remember her.
Whether or not you have any sort of affection inside of you that you want to give to your boyfriend...
- You don't think I have any affection?
- I mean, right now, I don't know.
Really, Sarah?
- Sneak out.
Make things so hard, all the time.
Look, I just wanna get out of here and forget this shitty day, all right?
Oh, I'm sorry, but you're not going anywhere.
It's not your job to hover over me all the time.
I wish I didn't have to.
Yeah, I got it covered, Dad.
Have a safe trip.
I'll text you when I get there.
Sure.
Oh, and can you go around back and check the pool cover?
Yeah, I got it.
Just something Debbie and I used to do ages ago.
- It was a joke, right?
- We pretended it was real.
We asked it questions like, "Do I have a secret admirer?"
"Will we be friends forever?" Things like that.
I didn't know she had one.
I have so many questions.
Laine, it's not your fault.
You just don't know when it's gonna be the last time you get to talk to someone.
I never even got to say goodbye.
I know.
Pete.
Can you talk?
Yeah, sure.
I haven't gotten a chance to check in with you yet.
Are you doing okay?
I guess.
I can't bring myself to erase her voicemails.
I keep listening to them and it's like she's here, you know?
Leaving me messages, making plans.
Before Debbie died, did you notice anything going on with her?
Like what?
Acting different.
Yeah, she seemed worried about something.
Did she ever say what it was?
I'd text her, she'd blow me off.
- Why are you asking me all this?
- I guess I'm just not ready to let her go.
Neither am I.
But those things you were telling me the other day about feeling guilty, you don't have to keep doing this to yourself.
Do you ever feel like even after someone you love has died, there's still a way you can talk to them?
Yesterday, you said it was just a game.
If we play the game and nothing happens, then I'll never bring it up again.
But I really wanna try, so will you guys just do this with me?
Sarah?
Sarah!
What the hell, Laine?
What's wrong with that is that you're a kid and that guy is too old for you!
All right. Since you can't be left alone, you're coming with me.
Look, this is where Debbie died.
We have to play here.
It's okay.
We're all together.
So, where are we gonna do this?
In there.
I'm gonna go and get the board.
How are you even supposed to talk to someone using a board game?
I mean, like, "Yo, can you hear me?
- It's okay.
What the hell are you doing, man?
- So, let's play.
Like, you're never supposed to play in a graveyard, never play alone, and always say goodbye.
Can we just do this?
I don't even think I believe in these things, but I still don't wanna touch it.
Circle the board, once for each of us.
And then you say these words.
If there's a presence here, please make yourself known.
Is there a presence here among us?
This is a joke.
Is there something you wanna tell us?
It spelled, "Hi, friend."
Hi, friend.
When I was here yesterday, was that you?
Who is this?
Debbie.
- Let's just stop it now.
Debbie, was there something I could have done?
Did you really do this?
Laine, keep going.
We all do.
- Laine!
It's just a game.
For all we know, it was Laine.
Maybe it was really something she needed.
Might not have even known she was doing it.
What if she's trying to tell me something?
Oh, my God!
I saw a reflection in the mirror, and then someone pushed me from behind.
What?
It's just that you need to believe that was really Debbie.
You were there.
It was weird, right?
Yeah, it was weird.
But I don't know if it means anything.
Laine, you said goodbye to her.
I couldn't sleep last night.
We don't have to talk about it.
Iz, I know you didn't wanna be there.
Let's just forget the whole deal, yeah?
Nona, what are you doing?
You should never touch these things.
You used it, didn't you?
It was just once.
Who is that?
Oh, hey, can you grab the garbage on your way out?
Thank you.
Hi, Isabelle.
Where?
No, no, it doesn't sound crazy at all.
We're simply telling ourselves what we wanna believe.
Sarah?
- Was that you?
- No, I thought it was you.
Go!
Okay, just be quiet, just be quiet.
Sarah, stay back, okay?
Isabelle was shaking when I picked her up last night.
Did we all see it?
Debbie's trying to reach us.
- What could she want?
- If we wanna know, we gotta ask her.
I think we should say the words together.
As friends we've gathered, hearts are true.
Spirits near, we call to you.
If there's a presence here, make yourself known.
Can you show us a sign?
Are you here?
Come on, guys.
You didn't kill yourself, did you?
I knew it.
Debbie, if you didn't do this, who did?
Who did it?
Who hurt you?
Debbie, why won't you answer us?
I have a question.
On our first real date away from everybody else, we told everybody we went to the fair, but where did we really go?
Do you remember that?
What I said to you?
This isn't Debbie.
What do you mean?
Is this you, Debbie?
Then who the hell is this?
Were we ever talking to Debbie?
Laine, we can stop.
When Debbie played the Ouija, did she make contact with you?
D.Z., where are you?
The chair.
I don't see anything.
Guys, I think we should get out of...
"Run"?
- "She's coming."
- Who's coming?
"Mother."
We're walking away from the board, the whole thing.
Debbie played, and now she's dead.
Operation Clean House.
I get to clean the attic!
God.
I'm not gonna lie, that was not fun.
- They go together.
- She found it in her house.
Do I like my find?
She played alone?
As you know, our community has been devastated the last few weeks.
First with Debbie, and now, Isabelle.
When you lose someone close to you, there's always help available.
We care about you.
Now... there's a lot of very, very helpful information in here about dealing with loss and moving forward.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
- Laine, we're only trying to help you.
I know, and I'll never forgive myself.
This thing, it's haunting us, wherever we go, watching everything we do.
It's coming for all of us.
So, who's next?
Hey, I need you.
It's just us now.
I think that's where Debbie found it.
Laine, are you all right?
Pete.
Pete, grab this.
Laine!
Hey, this is the family.
For some reason, they're still connected to the house.
From the look of these photos, I'd say this is the late '40s, the early '50s.
I can try.
We need to find out who they are.
I found this old article.
Doris Zander.
D.Z. This is her.
Pete, listen.
They suspected the mother had something to do with her disappearance.
So, who is the other girl in the pictures with them?
Doris had a sister.
And she might still be alive.
May I help you?
I'm here for visiting hours.
Thank you.
They told me my niece was here to visit.
I don't have a niece.
My name is Laine.
I'm here to ask about your sister, Doris.
Doris.
My best friend, Debbie, lived in your old house.
I believe there's a presence in that house.
I wouldn't be surprised if there's more than one.
I found pictures of you and your sister.
Please bring them.
I haven't seen my sister's face in a very long time.
At least not her real face.
Mother did that to her.
My mother practiced mediumship.
And if practice makes perfect, let me tell you, she was pretty damn good, depending on your point of view.
She was fascinated by it all.
- The spirits.
She used Doris.
And then something went wrong with Mother.
Mother was consumed by them.
She was insane.
So, she did that to Doris.
To her lips.
To stop them from talking.
And then Doris went missing?
Missing.
And after that, I did what I needed to do to stop Mother.
That's why I'm here.
But that doesn't mean Mother is gone.
You said you saw her.
The link is between them.
The energy is growing, and it is hard to stop.
Mother used to have a secret room.
She sealed it up, after Doris, down in the basement.
What do I have to do?
It's supposed to be somewhere here.
Pete, grab this.
This is crazy, Laine.
What?
The shadow.
Trevor!
Trevor!
Sarah, I need your help!
No, no, no, not now.
Come on.
- Are you guys okay?
Where's Laine?
Okay, to our future selves, I hope we look back on this, and...
Debbie?
My tenacious little niece.
I did everything you said.
Mother must have come back, because my friend Pete, another friend, is dead.
She's free.
You lied to me.
I heard the voices, too.
They tell you the most wonderful, awful things.
You're gonna hear them, too, little girl.
You'll hear them soon enough because she's coming to get you, too.
She's gonna keep her promises!
A connection, once made to a spirit, is very difficult to break.
The board is just the conduit.
- I'll call Trevor.
- Thank you.
Wait up!
Sarah?
Laine?
Trevor's already here.
Trevor!
Where is he?
Trevor?
No!
Go get the board.
Sarah!
I guess you never really feel like you get to say goodbye and maybe that's okay.
At the age of 26, Ludwig van Beethoven went deaf, ending his career as a successful concert pianist.
But determined not to let a little thing like his hearing end his music career, my pal Ludwig became a composer.
Turned out the new gig suited him.
But then he fell in love with teaching.
Now he spends his days in the mosh pit that is high school English class.
Or my mom, a riot girl who found her calling as a part-time travel agent and a full-time supermom.
These days, she only moshes with Teddy.
Scooch over, dude.
And then there's me.
Turns out, I had no idea.
Your coffee, maestro.
No way, dude.
You don't give crack to somebody who's already on speed.
Hey, did you see this?
I got a Google Alert about it yesterday.
Everything he's ever wanted's actually coming true.
I'm just saying that if you miss each other it's okay to reach out.
Now let's update you on the snowstorm and school closures.
Baby, turn that up.
Portland and Clackamas counties are now calling for a snow day.
School's out forever!
Did you really just quote Alice Cooper?
My God, son, have I taught you nothing?
You guys are all playing hooky without me?
But sometimes you got to, like, noodge it a little.
It'd be bad to go to work with this cough, spreading my germs around.
You know how when you meet someone and they just already are the person they're meant to be?
That was Adam.
What class was this?
Advanced Composition.
What's she doing?
She's more advanced.
I think everyone left.
Oh, and, by the way, that Adam rocker dude was totally checking you out.
Adam Wilde saw me geeking out?
He saw you blissing out and he was into it.
No, he isn't "into it," Kim.
Do not take his picture, Kim.
I'm not an amateur.
You're welcome.
I'm Adam.
I kno...
Hi.
Kinda.
It's Chinese.
Hey, I got some tickets to see a cellist.
Really?
Anyhow, it's this Friday.
I could pick you up.
It's too late.
I see you.
Oh, my God!
What?
You got two types of girls in this world, Mia.
So much happier.
I'm totally off the hook.
What are we doing today?
We can go the farm, visit Henry, Willow and the baby?
Stop by my folks' place for a late lunch?
Mia, you gonna come with us?
I don't know.
There's this tricky part of the Beethoven sonata that I've really gotta nail, and, well, the letters were mailed on Friday.
Okay, this is painful to watch.
Look, who knows what time the mail's even gonna be delivered today?
How many snow days are we gonna be able to spend together?
Are you really playing the guilt card right now?
Honey, guilt and bribery are the glue that have held parents and teenagers together for generations.
Don't fight tradition.
Fine.
Teddy, you can listen to Iggy on your iPod.
- Yes, sir.
Well, I choose Ludwig van Beethoven.
Surprise.
Dad's band was called Nasty Bruises.
Embarrassing, I know.
They were what you might call "big" in our town.
And for a while, everyone thought they might get bigger.
That was my preschool.
Cellos are crazy expensive.
So, I borrowed a crappy one from school.
This is exactly why I could never procreate.
Amen, sister.
But what really hooked me was that feeling I got in my chest.
It's like my heart was beating with the cello.
You want me to tell her to hang it up for the night?
No.
I wonder where she gets that from.
But mostly to get laid.
Well, that's probably not her motivation.
We made that.
Isn't it amazing how life is one thing and then, in an instant, it becomes something else?
And just like that...
Mom.
Teddy!
No!
Wake up!
Tell Portland to have a trauma team ready.
Glasgow Coma?
Why do you need a trauma team?
Teddy!
Hang in there, baby.
We'll be in Portland soon.
Your closet's terrifying.
I don't even wanna go.
Come on, he's just a guy, Mia.
Yeah, but he's the first guy I've ever gone on a maybe-date with and I don't know whether to wear date clothes or casual clothes or...
Just wear, you know, something you feel good in.
Oh, I think I'm gonna puke.
Better before than during.
Nice threads.
Oh, wow, you're impressing me already.
Well, I have your CDs.
You're the one.
Adam's here!
She was Nasty Bruises' original groupie.
Your parents seem pretty cool.
So they tell me.
Seriously, I respect any musician who just leaves it all on the stage like that.
She was awesome.
I loved every minute of it.
All right, Hall, so what's your story?
How did parents like yours end up having a kid like you?
Well, I was certainly bred to be a rocker.
No, but seriously.
My mom's this tough chick and my dad's all outgoing and I went and chose Beethoven and the cello.
When I was eight, I saw this old video of the Ramones playing "I Wanna Be Sedated".
And it felt like my head exploded.
And I was like, "I have to learn to play the guitar."
So, my uncle hooked me up with this old Fender.
Yeah, that thing saved my life.
You didn't really get those tickets from a family friend, did you?
That was two weeks of pizza delivery tips.
Why?
Why me?
Because I like to watch you play.
You get this crease in your forehead right there.
Why do I have this feeling you're about to mess up my entire life?
A little mess never hurt anybody.
A week later, Adam invited me to see his band play.
Okay.
Thank you and good night.
So, what other bands are you into?
Classical mostly.
Okay.
Well, we'll set you loose early.
Yo, Adam, just kiss her and let's go, man.
Come on.
We're cool.
You two have a lot in common.
You ever, like, hooked up, or...
For instance, we're both into girls.
She's with Astrid.
Yeah, I know.
- Dad?
- Sorry.
Like, your mom and dad are cool with you staying out, but you don't want to, or...
Look, I think I'm coming down with something.
Right.
Yeah, well, just give me a shout when you get over it.
I'll see you around.
Maybe I'll check it out.
You know, that was wrong on so many levels.
She shouldn't be scared to hang out with those guys.
They're us.
Exactly.
What do we got here?
Brain contusions, full extent unknown.
And an internal bleed.
Rest of the family's on the way in.
Ultrasound, X-ray, 12-chem, type and cross-match.
Hey, excuse me, I need to check on my family.
It's Kathleen Hall, Dennis Hall and Theodore Hall?
Hey, I was trying to look at that.
Ruptured spleen, we need to move.
We're taking Mia Hall into operating room one.
All right, let's get her in there.
We got to remove the spleen, drain the lung and figure out what's causing the bleed.
If she wants to live, she better start fighting.
Someone just talk to me, please!
Am I gonna die?
Is that what this is?
Here's the secret, baby.
You control this whole thing.
If you live, if you die, it's all up to you.
So, whatever fight you got in you, you got to pull it out now.
I think we're gonna need a lot more than that.
One of her parents is on their way to OR four now.
Dad?
We just have to relieve the swelling.
For a guy who was in such a bad car wreck, he really lucked out.
Do we want him?
I was hungry.
Well, I'm glad you came.
I just worked a double and I need to feast.
I'm eatin' dim sum for a twosome.
It's nice to see ya.
Play your cards right, we might make you a regular.
Come on.
- The guy from Dead Moon.
- Andrew Loomis.
And the guy from The Wipers, Sam Henry.
That's a good point.
Mia, your man knows his punk rock history.
Thanks.
Oh, God, something just stung me.
Who does that?
A bee?
Trust me, this is this only thing I learned in Boy Scouts.
Got it.
Way hotter than tweezers.
You know, you should get stung more often.
I'm sorry to say that's the furthest we've gotten since our first date.
I like where your head's at, Hall.
Adam?
I'm coming up.
No, you cannot come up.
I thought you went home.
I got lost.
Did you actually learn that beesting thing from the Boy Scouts?
No, I totally made it up.
I just really wanted to suck your hand in front of all your parents' friends.
What did you want to tell me?
Today was awesome.
You guys are like a real family here.
Yeah, well, trust me, it hasn't always been that way.
When I was a kid, things were so chaotic.
They'd be up late, so I was up late.
And Dad would be on the road for weeks at a time.
They didn't really get it together until Teddy was born.
They're not really a part of my life.
Honestly, I can't remember them ever being in the same place for a meal.
And if you want to track down the old man, that's gonna take a while.
Adam.
But that's the thing, you're not alone.
Not anymore.
Wait.
I need to take it slow, okay?
I love slow.
Is there enough room?
A little more underneath, please.
The surgery's been going on for hours, and they're nowhere near done.
I need to find my family.
Kim?
Kim, wait!
We need to find out what the hell's going on here.
Excuse me, my name is Estelle Hall.
Our son, Denny Hall, his wife, Kathleen, and their two kids got in a car accident this morning and we'd like to find out how they're doing.
I am so sorry for what's happened.
Now, I haven't been able to speak to anyone's doctors yet, but I do know that Mia and Dennis are still in surgery.
Most likely they'll be heading to the ICU.
There is no information on Kathleen in the system yet.
Hey, Henry and Willow are on their way.
And I tried calling Adam and left a couple messages, but I haven't heard anything yet.
There are two types of people in this world, Kim.
Yeah, well, it kind of smells like Christmas threw up in your mug.
Fine by me.
So, Adam.
Is it awesome?
It feels big.
But...
For starters, I hate going to his shows.
Do you not like his music, or...
No, I love his music.
He writes these amazing songs, and...
Like a fish out of water?
Like a fish on Mars.
Come on, it's not his friends you're afraid of, it's him.
I mean, he's older, he's in a band.
Every last one of 'em.
But if it gets serious, you better not turn into one of those girlfriends who only speaks in the first person plural.
"We only like quinoa."
If you ever turn into one of those girls, I'mma gonna shoot ya.
Or Patti Smith or Joan Jett.
What's this, a social studies project?
No, it's for Halloween.
Tonight, with Adam.
Oh, you're going as the rocker chick.
Then you return all the clothes to my closet in the morning and go about your life.
I mean, I know it's not your thing, but why not try out messy and in-the-moment and see how it feels.
You might be surprised.
Hey, Adam.
Whoa, yourself.
I'm Beethoven.
Ludwig.
Come on, let's go.
What's up, Adam?
Bottoms up.
No running off with some me wannabe.
I'll try.
Have fun.
Oh, my God, Mia.
Come on, at least give me your bone number.
Ladies and gentlemen, Willamette Stone!
At last, you finally figured it out.
No, come on.
I mean, do you like me how I am tonight?
Better than the normal Mia.
You know, with the hair and the makeup and the clothing.
Mia, I don't give a shit about your clothes.
Don't you get it?
The you you are now is the same you I was in love with yesterday.
The same you I'll be in love with tomorrow.
What is this place?
It's an old boatworks shed.
One day, me and the band are gonna fix it up and we're gonna rehearse and record here.
It's perfect.
So are you.
Adam.
All right, well, take your jacket off.
So we have four strings.
And if I were to play glissando, it'd feel like this.
And if I were to play pizzicato, it'd feel like this.
And if I were to play forte.
I know forte.
How are we, beautiful?
I told 'em that I don't wanna leave you.
I'm not gonna let you out of my sight.
We have another one from the accident, Nurse Davis.
Oh, my God, George.
Is he going to be okay?
Dad?
I'll just finish writing the orders and then she's all yours.
Teddy.
You got the best place in the joint.
Are you okay?
I'm not going anywhere.
They're saying he's through the worst of it.
They were assigning his room, so, I thought I'd come here before I checked in on Kat and Den...
They didn't...
Excuse me.
You're mine now, Teddy.
And no matter what, I will never leave you.
We're gonna make it.
Adam.
You came.
You have got to fight.
Being with Adam was like learning to fly.
It was exciting and scary, all at the same time.
That spring was a magical time.
Adam's band was playing bigger clubs and festival in different cities.
Once he graduated, they started getting booked even more.
By the fall, record labels were taking notice.
People were taking notice of me too.
I was the first high school student ever invited to perform solo at the college's fall recital.
And even though Adam was away a lot, when he was in town, we spent all of our time together.
I can't believe I'm stuck at school for another year.
It'll go by fast.
You still thinking of applying to Lewis Clark?
I need someplace with financial aid.
Maybe we can live around the corner from each other.
Or we could shorten the commute and get a place together.
Really?
That actually sounds kinda perfect.
Sir, I told you you can't go in there.
Sir, you can't be in there.
You need to calm down.
Come on, just let him in!
Do I need to call security?
Juilliard?
Just look on the computer like you do and see what it takes to get in there.
They say it's the best there is.
Of course it is, but it's across the country.
You know, and Lewis Clark has an amazing performance studies program.
Besides, my whole life is here.
Do you ever miss being in your band?
What brought this on?
You always say that you left your band to become a better dad.
But you were a great dad when you were in the band.
You didn't have to give up something you loved so much just for us.
No, baby, I didn't give anything up.
I played that adventure out, and then it was time for a new adventure with you guys.
And sometimes you make choices in life, and sometimes choices make you.
There you go.
Maybe New York.
I gotta tell you something.
I have to listen to what you have to tell me.
I'm going to buy all of these albums.
Slow down, big spender.
Dad, honestly, how was that one?
You say that about everything.
I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean that.
This is pointless.
I'm not good enough.
I thought the last one was amazing.
Really?
I think I can do better.
Then let's do it.
I miss you every time you go.
Well, I know you guys are gonna kill it at City Limits.
Are you sure you can't come?
I'm pretty sure I can fit you in my guitar case.
I would, but I got school.
We roll.
Yeah, life on the road.
Don't give me that face.
Speaking of the devil.
Yeah, they're throwing us a party right now.
Well, I miss you.
Wait.
Sorry.
Mia, wait.
It's our first gig in town since we got signed.
I applied to Juilliard.
- What?
- Yeah, it's this amazing school.
Yeah, I know what Juilliard is.
Well, it was just on a whim.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Well, I tried but I figured, why tell you until it was real?
Yeah, well, I won't get in.
But it's kind of a big deal that I even got an audition.
Most people don't.
The homecoming concert was different than any show the band had played.
They were tighter, better, more confident than ever before.
And Adam seemed, well, like he was becoming a full-blown star.
Did you like the show?
You guys were insanely good up there.
Yeah, well, I'm glad you could make it.
Of course I made it.
Yeah, sure.
If you're so bored you have to read, maybe you should've just stayed home.
I'm just trying to get some homework done.
What's all this?
We got booked last-minute to do a string of shows in Seattle.
We gotta leave tonight, so...
It's hard to say.
What, like you told me about Juilliard?
And for the record, I didn't even hear about the tour until tonight right before the show, so...
Why would I be pissed about you going to a school 3,000 miles away?
Which you didn't even tell me about, Mia!
Am I crazy, or did you say that us getting a place together would be perfect?
It's fine.
Even if I do go to Juilliard, we can figure it out.
Baby, we can text and we can Skype...
But Skype, it solves everything right?
You know, you're so naive, man.
You don't know shit about the world.
I can't believe you just said that to me.
Sorry, dude, but we gotta jet if we wanna make it to the motel before sunup.
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe because I am terrified of losing you!
Fine, but for the record, you're the one who's getting in the van.
Yeah, whatever.
So, Mia's still unconscious.
The respiratory therapists are going to run some tests to see when they can wean her off the ventilator.
So, that's good news.
If she can breathe on her own.
With comatose patients, the first 24 hours are critical.
- That's gonna be fun!
I thought you were supposed to be, in Seattle.
No show tonight so I just thought I'd drive down for the day.
What's that?
That's the ceiling.
I put it up there.
It's intense.
What do you want, Adam?
You can't just disappear from my life like that and pop back into it whenever you feel like it.
You're not gonna lose me.
Adam, I love you.
But these last few days have been brutal.
Happy birthday.
It's a cello and a guitar.
Do you get it?
God, I hate you.
What was, like, the moment?
Actually, there was one night.
When we first started playing out.
Right before the show, Liz talked me into going to the liquor store and getting her a Red Bull.
So I go in and there's this drunk dude buying a bottle of Jack.
And I just stopped cold.
And he just looks right at me and walks out.
No idea who I was.
Shit, Adam.
Then that night, I played like I was on fire.
Till now.
Till you.
How am I supposed to find the strength to stay?
What would it feel like to wake up an orphan?
To never smell Dad cooking pancakes?
To never stand next to Mom quietly talking as we do the dishes?
But how could I go?
The nurse said I control this whole thing.
And that terrifies me more than anything else.
Mia Hall.
Good luck.
Thanks for driving me, Gramps.
I mean, that was...
Thank you.
Well, you do.
You were fearless.
You played your guts out up there.
Your dad had it too, but I never told him.
I never made too much fuss about his music and I don't wanna make the same mistake with you.
If those Juilliard people don't take you, they are damn fools because what you did up there was magic.
Thank you, Gramps.
That was a really beautiful song, Adam.
Are they gonna let you in on a full scholarship?
I did all right, I guess.
It was like I was possessed and the music, it just... it poured out of me.
I wish I could've seen that.
Yeah, me too.
You know, for once, I actually felt like I could do this.
Why didn't you call me after the audition to brag?
I know I should have, but...
So how come you've never written a song for me?
I don't know, I'm no good at writing about things that make me happy.
If you want a song, you're gonna have to, like, cheat on me or something.
But if you do get in, the choice is already made, isn't it?
If it was me, you'd let me go.
Yeah, but in a way, I already have.
You know, you're going to your own Juilliard.
Yeah, I know.
But I'm still here.
Yeah, me too.
There you are.
Been looking everywhere for you.
Guess your big show got canceled, huh?
Like I give a shit.
I get it.
The first day, man.
The first day I walked past that room and saw her playing, that was it.
God, I'm such an asshole.
I don't know.
Letters sent out Friday.
I think she was supposed to hear today.
Let's go.
What now?
And she's down there and she's just grunting and screaming and there's blood everywhere!
- Shit!
Excuse me, young man, I've told you you can't be here.
Please, I just wanna feel you touch me.
You can't do this to him!
You know, I tried to do this the nice way.
What the hell is going on?
They were trying to break into the ICU.
Yeah, 'cause Jabba the Nurse wouldn't let us in to see Mia.
Well, I know these kids personally, so, why don't you just let me handle it from here.
What the hell were you guys thinking?
I need to see Mia.
Well, she's gonna need you now more than ever.
Hey, what's going on?
Willow, what's happening?
Willow, why aren't you with Teddy?
Mr. and Mrs. Hall.
Where is he?
He will never graduate from T-ball to baseball.
And never learn to drive.
Never kiss a girl.
Never fall in love.
God!
I want this to be over!
They know we're coming?
After that, it's all you.
Goodbye, Adam.
- There you are!
- Here I am!
Happy New Year!
"It was as if no time they spent together could ever be wasted."
Who said that?
Some guy in some book.
And what was he talking about?
Some couple in some movie.
My point is...
Yes, maestro?
My point is he could have been talking about us.
That he could.
Promise me.
I promise you.
Wait, what am I promising?
That we'll spend next New Year's together.
Even if we're in different places, you'll still be with me.
No, that's not good enough.
Not Skyping, not texting, together.
Baby, you know we can't promise each other that.
I guess we both know where this is heading.
Yeah, I guess so.
Happy New Year!
I'm definitely not drunk.
How was Adam?
Take your mimosas.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, it's gross.
It's not gross.
Make us feel better.
Warm water, soap.
And now, we're just moving in different directions.
Is it over?
You're supposed to break up with someone because you're not in love with them.
Not because you're completely in love with them.
But what do I know, right?
You know plenty.
It's just very inconvenient to fall in love at your age.
Especially if it's the real thing.
You know, like normal people do.
There's no such thing as normal, Mia.
Yeah, I know.
Don't blame it on music.
Yeah, but music's the reason we're breaking up.
What am I gonna do?
I am being completely torn in half.
You're going to go to Juilliard and play the hell out of your cello.
Or you're not.
You're gonna stay with Adam and have lots of amazing adventures.
Or you're not.
Or maybe tomorrow, the Earth's gonna smash into a meteor.
Or it's not.
Life is this big fat gigantic stinking mess.
But that's the beauty of it too.
Whatever you do, I support you.
What can I say, baby?
True love's a bitch.
Gramps, what do I do?
I've been trying to think of what Denny would want me to say to you.
The kid was a helluva of dad, wasn't he?
He sure had me beat.
I remember the day that he quit the band.
I was surprised.
I never really liked the way the band sounded, but I knew how important it was to him.
And so I asked him, I said, "Why are you quitting?"
"For your kids."
He said that without even blinking.
That's why he quit the band.
For Teddy.
For you.
It was when he heard you play so well.
I think that's when it clicked for him.
Your incredible talent, it...
He just couldn't believe it.
And all he wanted to do was to give you more.
So, he quit the band, he sold his drum kit and he bought you that cello.
Sacrifice.
That's what we do for the people that we love.
And here's mine, Mia.
I want you to live.
I want that more than anything in this world.
I want you to fight like hell to stay with us.
It might be too hard for you to keep fighting, so...
It's okay.
I understand.
Thank you.
Gramps?
There are like 30 people in that waiting room.
Some are related to you and some aren't, but we're your family.
You still have a family, Mia.
Look.
You were so happy that day.
And no matter what, that's the way I'm always gonna remember you.
The best day of my life was one I never even saw coming.
It was Labor Day, early this fall before things started to go bad with Adam.
In some ways, it was just like a usual potluck dinner.
But there was a special feel to it.
People kept on showing up.
All the old friends from Dad's band days and all the new ones from Adam's band.
Not for us, with us.
Seriously, Mia, if you don't, I will.
And have you ever heard the sound of a thousand dying cats?
I really hate you all.
I've always thought of the cello as a solo instrument.
It's probably why it's always made me so comfortable.
Just me and my cello.
It's part of something bigger.
The thing is, Mom and Dad always had their scene.
And Adam had his.
And I was always jealous because I didn't have mine.
Until the night of the bonfire.
That was my scene.
That was where I belonged.
That's what happiness felt like.
But that could never exist again.
Just after this piece.
Mia.
Don't.
Stay.
I know a huge part of your life is forever ruined because of what happened today.
I'm not dumb enough to think that I can fix it.
You can't.
But I went to your house.
And I had to climb up the balcony to get in like I used to.
And I found this in your mail slot.
I totally broke and entered and stole your mail, so the Feds might be comin' after me.
Mia, you got in.
I got in.
And if you want me to come with you, I will.
Okay, I'll move to New York.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just please stay.
You're my home, Mia.
I know that now.
I will do anything if you stay.
I can't.
You know I can't.
I'm still kinda working on this thing, but...
You wrote me a song.
You still have a family.
I will do anything if you stay.
Mia.
Peeta...
Peeta was left behind.
You need to sleep.
We can help you sleep.
Just five more minutes.
Finnick.
I wish she was dead.
I wish they were all dead and we were, too.
Miss Everdeen.
Colonel Boggs, District 13's head of security.
I know you've been discharged, but President Coin's requested to meet with you first.
Is there any news?
I'm just here to escort you.
We were always told there was nothing left of 13.
Capitol bombed the surface to rubble.
But we're military, so we learned to survive down here.
Preparing, training.
The war never stopped for us.
Madam President, may I present you with The Mockingjay.
What an honor it is to meet you.
And I can't imagine what it's like to live through the atrocities of those Games.
Katniss, President Alma Coin.
Please know how welcome you are.
I hope you'll find some comfort with us.
We've known loss in 13, too.
Are you aware of what's happened?
When you fired your arrow at the force field you electrified the nation.
There have been riots and uprisings and strikes in seven districts.
We believe that if we keep this energy going we can unify the districts against The Capitol.
But if we don't, if we let it dissipate, we could be waiting another 75 years for this opportunity.
And I wish that I did.
But there's no way for me to contact my operatives inside The Capitol.
The Capitol has always suppressed communication between the districts.
So we're gonna shoot a series of propaganda clips, propos, I like to call them, on The Mockingjay.
You left him there.
This revolution is about everyone.
It's about all of us.
And we need a voice.
Then you should've saved Peeta.
This is not the girl you described.
There's explaining and there's showing.
Let her see what The Capitol did to 12.
This is the only choice you have.
People don't always show up the way you want them to, Madam President.
We have to have a lightning rod.
Send her.
I need to see it for myself.
This way.
13 swept everything top to bottom, so you'd be safe.
You sure you don't want me to go with you?
We'll have our eyes on you from above.
Figures.
Don't you wanna see Prim?
Egeria!
We need to fix these lines.
I won't say "rebels."
We'll call them "criminals."
Otherwise we're breaking my oldest rule.
Never let them see you bleed.
Citizens, tonight I address all of Panem as one.
In the past weeks, you have heard of sporadic violence following the actions of a few radicals in the Quarter Quell.
It is a contract.
To refuse work is to put the entire system in danger.
The Capitol is the beating heart of Panem.
Nothing can survive without a heart.
The criminals that kneel before you use symbols for the purpose of sedition.
Which is why all images of The Mockingjay are now forbidden.
It's okay.
We're okay.
We're all here now.
Buttercup!
I smuggled him in.
I got Dad.
And I got some of your herbs from the kitchen.
They have strict rules.
I don't know what they'll do if they find him here.
You should try to eat something.
Because you are going to want to witness this tonight.
There has been rampant speculation about what really happened in the Quarter Quell.
And here to shed a little light on the subject for us is a very special guest.
Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark.
Peeta, a lot of people feel as though they are in the dark.
Yeah, I know how they feel.
No, I was caught up trying to play allies.
And then they separated us and... that's when I lost her.
And then the lightning hit... and the whole force field around the arena just blew out.
No, she didn't know what she was doing.
It seems as though she was part of a rebel plan.
Do you think it was part of her plan to be almost killed by Johanna?
Or part of the plan to be paralyzed by lightning?
I want everyone who's watching to stop and to think about what a civil war could mean.
I want everyone to stop the senseless violence.
There can't be a ceasefire.
Not after everything Snow's done.
He could have done a lot of damage tonight.
He didn't look that bad.
Maybe he made some kind of deal to protect you.
He's still playing the game.
Peeta, will you stay with me?
Always.
Can't sleep?
Tell me what's happening.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
Even from Mom.
No one hates The Capitol more than me.
I know he's not safe there, but he's definitely not safe here.
I don't think you know how important you are to them.
If you want something, you just have to ask.
I should wake you up more often, Little Duck.
Get some sleep now.
You, too.
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.
Peeta and the other Tributes, Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta, will be rescued at the earliest opportunity.
And the same goes for the other Tributes.
No.
It's not their fault you abandoned them in the arena.
They're doing and saying whatever they can to survive.
Thank you.
Do you have any other conditions?
My sister gets to keep her cat.
Go away.
Is it visiting hours again?
We have a bigger issue than wardrobe, Miss Trinket.
- And your Girl on Fire is burnt out.
I need you to join this team now.
He's drying out in some facility a mile down.
Aiding rebels is not really my forte.
Miss Trinket, your days in The Capitol are over, no matter what happens here.
I'll find someone else to be The Mockingjay's escort.
Who?
Anyone can be replaced.
Not your Mockingjay.
There isn't a soul in this dungeon who knows the first thing about Katniss.
You honestly believe one of these cave dwellers is going to take my place?
No.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for interrupting your schedules.
Coin lost her family, too.
Daughter and a husband.
Katniss Everdeen has consented to be the face of our cause to help unite the districts against The Capitol.
In exchange, I have promised several concessions.
First, we'll assess all opportunities for the extraction of the Victors held hostage in The Capitol.
- Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.
- ...and Annie Cresta.
Once freed, they will be granted full pardon for any and all crimes committed against the rebel cause.
That's good, Katniss.
Madam President, may I say you are so very... concise.
You believe that there's more to be said?
I'm only talking about salesmanship.
One sure way to put it out is to smother it.
Or to use up all the air in the room.
Excuse me.
Effie?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a political refugee.
- Plutarch rescued you?
- Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it.
You and I were both in the dark.
Now I'm condemned to this life of jumpsuits.
It is wonderful to see you again.
Can you believe this place?
I miss coffee.
I never knew anyplace could be so strict.
Luckily, I remembered that this was all the rage when I was coming up.
You know, everything old can be made new again.
Like democracy.
Which brings me to this.
Cinna.
He's dead, isn't he?
Yes, dear.
He made Plutarch promise not to show you this until you'd decided to be The Mockingjay on your own.
He believed in this revolution.
He believed in you.
They're beautiful.
There's not much of a prep team here in 13 but we will make you the best-dressed rebel in history.
Bring up the lights.
Cinna's final touch.
Everyone's either gonna wanna kiss you, kill you, or be you.
Little wind.
Whenever you're ready.
Let's try it again.
Whenever you're ready.
And that, my friends, is how a revolution dies.
Hello, Katniss.
This how you greet an old friend?
Maybe I don't recognize you sober.
I guess it looks as bad as it feels.
Madam President, indulge me for a moment, if you would.
Let's everybody think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you.
No, I'd like you all to think of one moment where she made you feel something real.
When she volunteered for her sister at the Reaping.
Excellent example.
I hope that wasn't important.
When she sang that song for little Rue.
You know, I like you better, Effie, without all that makeup.
Well, I like you better sober.
No one told her what to do.
And wash her face.
The opportunities for spontaneity are obviously lacking below ground.
So what you're suggesting is we toss her into combat?
- I wanna go.
- And if you're killed?
Make sure you get it on camera.
I've made you some surprises.
Maybe you wanna try one out.
If you're gonna be a part of Katniss' propo team, you may as well look the part.
And this one is for you.
It's beautiful.
And look here.
Let's not fire the red ones in here.
You had all of this and you just left the districts to fend for themselves?
There would've been nobody left to claim victory.
Sounds like exactly what Peeta said and then you all called him a traitor.
This way, soldier.
You are camera-ready.
Doesn't your comrade look handsome?
Let's go.
Come back safe.
Quick introductions, Katniss.
- This is my assistant, Messalla.
- It's an honor to meet you.
Let's get locked in.
And no, it wasn't any sort of rescue, if that's what you mean.
We all fled on our own.
For this.
For you.
Move out.
Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8.
- Well, we've got plenty of those.
Hospital's past that curtain.
Any hope you can give them, it's worth it.
The Capitol's done everything they can to break us.
Aren't you worried about having all your wounded in one place?
I think it's better than leaving them to die.
- That's not what I meant.
- Well, that's my only other option.
If you can come up with another, I'm all ears.
It's right through here.
Just let them see your face.
Katniss Everdeen?
What are you doing here?
What about the baby?
- I lost it.
- Are you fighting, Katniss?
You here to fight with us?
I am.
I will.
Tighter.
Tighter, tighter.
Sir, some cameras were damaged in the bombings, but we confirmed it's her.
Zoom in.
You wrote that speech yourself, Egeria.
Any association with the Mockingjay symbol is forbidden.
Everyone inside that hospital has committed treason.
Show them what it costs to be friends with Katniss Everdeen.
Your mom's gonna be proud of you when she sees the footage.
- Will this play in the districts?
- It'll be tattooed on their eyes.
- There's a problem.
- What kinda problem?
Incoming bombers from the north.
- We need to find cover now.
- There's a bunker in there.
Straight ahead and down the stairs.
Katniss!
Everdeen!
You okay?
Move!
They're circling back around.
Katniss?
Katniss, can you tell everyone what you're seeing right now?
Katniss, what do you wanna say?
And there will be no survivors.
If you think for one second that The Capitol will ever treat us fairly you are lying to yourselves.
Because we know who they are and what they do.
I have a message for President Snow.
You can torture us and bomb us and burn our districts to the ground.
But do you see that?
Fire is catching.
And if we burn, you burn with us!
We know who they are and what they do.
This is what they do!
And we must fight back.
You can torture us and bomb us and burn our districts to the ground.
And if we burn, you burn with us!
There is no progress without compromise.
No victory without sacrifice.
But I stand here with The Mockingjay to announce that our moment has arrived.
Beetee has increased our use of the airwaves tenfold.
We will broadcast this message to all the districts tonight.
The Mockingjay's words inspiring everyone to join the rebellion.
Together, we will become an alliance to be reckoned with.
You don't like hearing a fight song at a funeral?
The more people on our side, the closer we are to Peeta and Annie.
By order of President Snow daily production quotas have been increased.
All work shifts will be extended by an extra two hours.
Failure to meet these quotas will not be tolerated.
If we burn, you burn with us!
He's not even afraid of us.
It's 'cause they've never been hunted before.
It's almost not fair.
They want us back.
She was arguably our favorite Tribute.
And I think that's what we all find most astonishing, is that this girl was adored in The Capitol.
And I think for you, Peeta, it must be particularly painful.
A sweet gesture for a girl who has inspired such violence.
Don't be a fool, Katniss.
I know you never wanted the rebellion.
The things that you did in the Games were never intended to start all of this.
And ask yourself, can you trust the people you're working with?
- Do you know what they really want?
- We need to respond.
- I saw a coward.
I would never say what he just said.
When did "we" become you and Coin?
Everyone has a choice.
How can he sit there in The Capitol and defend the people who destroyed his home and murdered his family?
Nobody's seen what The Capitol did to 12.
I have to show them.
So I wanna start with you in front of the Justice Building, okay?
Katniss, tell us what happened here.
Peacekeepers forced us back into our homes.
For maybe an hour, the town was just dead quiet.
Little past 9:00, we heard their trucks pulling' out.
And I knew what that meant.
Me and a couple of guys from the mines, we started pulling people from their houses and tried to get 'em to the fence line but a lotta people were scared of the forest.
Stay with Gale.
915 of us made it to the fence.
Then we watched as... bombers circled back towards the road.
They firebombed them as they ran away.
915 outta 10,000.
- Some of the kids I could've carried.
- You saved so many people, Gale.
This is where you kissed me.
I didn't think you remembered that.
I'd have to be dead to forget that.
Maybe not even then.
'Cause I'm in pain.
That's the only way that I can get your attention.
Yeah, that's a mockingjay.
Well, now they'll never shut up.
You want me to sing?
Little on the nose, but, of course, so is war.
Guess I did my job too well.
At the time, I was just thinking of the science of it all.
We'll get through it.
Moves and countermoves.
Katniss, you're wanted in Command.
Tonight, we've received reports of derailed trains, of granaries on fire, and of a savage attack on the hydroelectric dam in District 5.
What have they done to you?
I'm begging for restraint and decency.
Peeta, please continue.
What will be left?
- Nothing on Doppler, ma'am.
It's time for an air raid drill.
This is a code red alert.
Please, remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.
Blast doors will be sealed in six minutes.
Madam President, three Capitol squadrons just entered our airspace.
- How much time do we have?
- They're a few seconds from range.
- Prepare to scramble the fleet.
- Copy that.
Open up short-range air defense.
Arm long-range missiles for counterattack.
- Where's Prim?
- I thought she went to find you.
She went back for the cat.
Blast doors will close in one minute.
Doppler shows a fourth wave approaching.
One.
- Blast doors are now sealed.
- I know, Prim.
There's nothing else in the northwest.
Our surface-to-air launchers just took a direct hit in sector 3.
Another 12 Capitol bombers approaching sector 3 in attack formation.
Hold fire on their approach.
But there's debris in the ventilation shaft.
They don't know what we have or where we have it.
They'll seal us in here like a tomb.
They promoted me at the hospital.
They'd be stupid not to.
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.
Snow's using Annie to punish you.
He's taunting us with them.
I didn't understand until just now watching that stupid cat.
We all expected you to continue that strategy.
How do you live with it?
I drag myself outta nightmares and there's no relief in waking up.
But... it's better not to give in to it.
Takes 10 times longer to put yourself back together than it does to fall apart.
Come with me.
Yeah.
I need you to do something for us.
Okay.
I won't forget that.
Thank you.
So Katniss, it's "13 is alive and well and so am I."
Why would they drop these?
For me.
Ready to go, Katniss?
We're gonna do this, just like District 8.
Tell me about the roses.
Tell Snow 13 is alive and well.
"13 is alive and well and so am I."
He's gonna kill Peeta.
- You can do it, Katniss.
- I can't do this.
"13 is alive and well and so am I."
He's doing this because I'm The Mockingjay.
He's punishing Peeta to punish me.
- Let her go.
So this is the end?
I suppose you're just gonna hide down here forever?
I can't be The Mockingjay.
You know, you're the only real friend I have down here.
I don't suppose they gave you any kind of medication?
- You're unbelievable.
- Okay, but I meant what I said.
And with the power out, Coin sees this as an opportunity.
And as opposed to having you two pointing at each other, she's going to get him.
Besides, it's already underway.
And guess who was the first brave soul to sign up.
Gale.
Castor, to the left.
Pollux, you're with me.
Okay.
And I'm coming to you from District 13, alive and well.
We've survived an assault from The Capitol.
But I'm not here to give you recent news.
- Why is Finnick doing a propo?
- It's a lot more than that.
- Beetee's commandeered the system.
- Now that they're down to generator power there's a more limited range of frequencies available to them.
And I'm filling them all up with Finnick.
Not many will see it, but whoever does will think it's another propo.
What they don't know is this broadcast is jamming their entire system with noise.
Early defense warning, internal communications, everything.
As long as the broadcast goes through, our team should be able to get in and out undetected.
Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One, you are one minute out from perimeter defense.
- Going dark.
If a Victor is considered desirable, the President gives them as a reward or allows people to buy them.
If you refuse, he kills someone you love.
Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds from perimeter defense.
Secrets.
Gear up.
Switching to Night View.
There.
Command, we have visual on the Tribute Center.
Initiating final approach.
Masks on.
See, I know all the depravity, the deceit and the cruelty of The Capitol's pampered elite.
But the biggest secrets are about our good President, Coriolanus Snow.
Open the door.
How, you may ask, did he do it?
Get ready to drop.
He stopped every mutiny before it even started.
Clear.
Even to allies who were threats.
Snow would drink from the same cup, to deflect suspicion.
Gale.
But he can't hide the scent of who he really is.
His weapon of choice is the only thing suited to such a man.
What is this place?
Madam President, should we call back the hovercraft?
Broadcast me.
If Snow's watching this, maybe he'll let the signal in, if he sees me.
- I know, but he might be.
President Snow, it's Katniss.
I need to speak with you.
President Snow, it's Katniss.
President Snow, are you there?
Can you hear me?
- President Snow...
I don't imagine you're calling to thank me for the roses.
- Command, I need a situation report.
You've already beaten me.
We're long past the opportunity for noble sacrifice.
You said you didn't want a war.
And that's just what's happened.
I told you what a fragile thing peace was.
And still, like a child, you took pleasure in breaking it.
I know what you are.
I know you can't see past your narrowest concerns.
Mockingjay One, prepare hovercraft for evac.
You asked me to convince you that I was in love with Peeta.
Haven't I at least done that?
Miss Everdeen, it's the things we love most that destroy us.
I want you to remember that I said that.
Don't you think I know your friends are in the Tribute Center?
Cut them off.
- Boggs, come in.
- What happened?
There's no news.
I'm sorry.
Especially for people like us.
But whatever strength, courage, madness, keeps us going, you find it, at times like these.
You have it, soldier.
It's what's kept you alive all this time.
And it won't fail you now.
They're back.
Johanna.
Finnick!
Gale!
Are you okay?
Every gun was back online and on us and we flew right past them.
They let us go.
He's in there.
The gas we used on the guards knocked him out, too, but it's wearing off now.
You should be there when he wakes up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Peeta.
It's called hijacking.
We don't know how long The Capitol's been doing this to Peeta.
They can change his memories of Katniss?
To make her seem life-threatening.
But you can reverse it?
It's new terrain.
Good evening.
Yesterday, I authorized a covert rescue mission inside The Capitol.
I am pleased to announce that the Victors have been liberated!
The road there leads through the sharp mountains and deep ravines of District 2.
There in the heart of Panem's steepest mountain range lies The Capitol's principal military facility.
We can conquer this stronghold because we are one people, one army, one voice.
Because today is our new beginning.
Jimmy, go with him.
Jesus, what's that smell?
What is that?
Where is it?
Garbage man found it in the bottom of the dumpster.
It's over there now.
Is that Sarchie?
Yeah, him and Butler were first on the scene.
It's a hat.
It's a Red Sox hat.
I love the Red Sox.
I love baseball.
Okay, name me one player on the Red Sox.
Larry Bird.
Don't laugh.
You think that's funny.
Come on, Sarchie, we both know you don't laugh.
I'll be laughing my fucking ass off.
Six Spec Ops Sergeant to Central K.
Go, Sergeant.
Run a name check on the 10-52.
You know, when your radar goes off, you usually wind up with stitches?
Six Special Ops, the name of the 10-52 tenant is Jimmy Tratner.
Any warrants?
Tenant is 10-19.
What?
Police, open up.
What?
We got a call.
Are you alone in there?
Maid's on vacation?
Watch out for a dog.
Ma'am, are you all right?
You wanna go the hard way?
You shut up!
Butler!
I'm good.
Do you like to beat your wife and kid?
Stitches.
Told you, Radar-Man.
Double shot, Johnnie Walker Black, please.
Sweetheart, it is for me.
Hey, Sergeant Sarchie, right?
I read about you in the paper a few years back.
They think he'll be okay.
Where's the woman?
She must be hiding somewhere in the park.
Why is it so dark in here?
This place is creepy after hours.
We should split up.
I'll go this way.
Fuck you.
Ma'am, what's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
Drugs, probably.
Or maybe she's just a big fan.
You guys get any statements from the witnesses who saw her throw the kid?
Did you guys get a statement from him?
No, I didn't even realize he was here till just now.
Hey, you!
Get me in there.
You stay right there.
Come on out.
Good morning, beautiful.
Good morning, stinky.
Where's little stink?
She's been sedated.
You know this lady?
Yeah, her name is Jane Crenna.
You got a name?
I'm a Jesuit priest.
There are worse ways to go.
Where's your collar, Padre?
I work undercover, like you.
Are you going with her?
Specialist.
Can you tell me exactly how she was behaving when you first saw her at the zoo?
Like she was nuts, that's how.
She's going to the loony bin where she belongs.
When you arrested her, did she seem unusually strong?
No, why?
No reason that would interest you.
No usable prints on the ladder or any of the paintbrushes.
What about the security cams?
The zookeepers can't explain how he let those goddamn lions loose.
Cameras were on the backup Genny, but the lawyers for the zoo want a written request for the footage.
Should only take a day or two.
I'm going to sleep now, but first, I want to tell you that I love you, and I miss you, and I wish you were home, and good night, and I got a gold star in class yesterday.
And I also love you, and miss you, and if you're home in time, I'll see you in the morning.
Sorry.
Be safe tonight.
She said that nobody's been down in that basement since it was painted two weeks ago, but that's where all the strange noises are coming from.
Gordon, did you say something about a room being painted?
Yeah, it was a basement.
That's not so weird.
Yeah, but she swears it was her pop.
He's been dead for seven years.
Nadler, you guys can skip this one.
We'll take the call.
Radar?
This is it.
I think the Addams Family lives here.
Salvatore Alberghetti?
We're from the 46 precinct.
May we come in?
Sorry for, mess.
It's, much trouble here.
Since worse, we sleep by door in case...
No sleeping alone.
This is my wife, Serafina.
Since a few weeks ago, we started seeing and hearing things.
What kind of things?
Things moving and sounds, mostly at night, coming from the basement.
Mama says, it's like the whole house is possessed.
She knows you don't believe, but it's okay.
Do you ever change a light bulb around here?
No matter how many times we get new, they burn out in a few hours.
We get holy candles from priest, but here, they no burn.
The candles won't burn?
Many times.
This Jesus, he came down off the wall and broke.
Jesus.
What the hell is wrong with it?
What are they saying?
All right.
We are gonna go down and check out the basement.
The bulb, it burn out.
Listen.
Is one of them, no?
Wore a hood.
A hood?
Dark.
Part of jacket.
Shit.
Griggs and Jane Crenna, the lady from the zoo.
Griggs, body in the basement.
Sweet Mary, that is sick.
Christina, here's your toast.
Why doesn't Daddy go to church with us?
Legend has it, your daddy used to go before we were married.
Did Grandma make you go when you were little?
Christina, go wait for me in the car.
A week ago.
Hey, honey...
I'm so happy.
I also got that surveillance video you requested.
You must be Catholic.
It's the second time you've called me Father.
Past tense.
Yeah, I guess I outgrew all that.
I came to see if you've made any progress in Jane Crenna's case.
What makes you think the case is still open?
Well, I went to the zoo and asked them to let me see the security camera recordings, and they told me only the arresting officers had permission for that.
Why do you want to see the recordings?
To help me determine why Jane did it.
I can save you the time.
The reason she hurt her kid is because she's fucking crazy, and now, she's in the loony bin where she belongs.
Well, how do you explain what she did?
I believe Jane's problem to be spiritual in nature.
I knew it.
I've experienced two types of evil in this life, Officer Sarchie.
I've seen enough.
And primary evil, which is something else entirely.
Meaning what?
I'm sure you remember that in Catholic teaching, there are very specific signs that indicate the presence of an evil spirit.
I'm sorry, Padre, but I think it's ridiculous to blame invisible fairies for the bad shit people do.
Okay, Father.
What you got?
Name is Mick Santino.
Both he and our wife-beater Jimmy served in Griggs' platoon in Iraq.
They attacked the battalion chaplain.
All three served time in the brig at Quantico before the Corps cut them loose.
So does the Corps got a home address on record for Santino?
Nope, just an old PO box that's no longer his.
What about Jane Crenna?
That's Griggs' wife.
And the kid she tossed at the zoo was theirs.
Maybe he was brought in to paint over it.
So what was she doing there?
Look at him.
It's like nothing ever happened.
Static.
I don't hear anything.
You didn't hear anything?
No static, no other voices?
That's when I called out to him.
He's about to move behind the trees.
Don't tell me you didn't see that.
Are you okay?
We missed you at the game today.
I had something to do.
Mommy took me to Grandma's house after school, and I got a new stuffed Angel Owl for my birthday!
Why don't you get your butt off my mother's couch when you say that?
Christina, will you shut up!
What the hell was that?
You never talk to her like that.
Just a little, tiny, dead sack in my hands.
You want to talk about it now?
I walk through the sewer every night.
I don't want to come home and do it again with you.
I'll talk to her.
She'll be all right.
Lucinda Tratner?
Do you know these other two men?
Jimmy served with them in Iraq.
Why do you ask?
Sergeant Griggs is dead.
When was the last time you saw Mick Santino?
Two weeks ago.
He and Sergeant Griggs, they started a painting company, and as a favor to Jimmy, they came over and started painting Jimmy's office.
Can you show me the room?
My husband, Jimmy, sometimes he has these fits where he claws at things.
One night I found him in the street clawing at the asphalt.
Sometimes he digs at the floor so hard, his fingers bleed.
Does he use any drugs?
Mental problems?
I don't know.
He came back broken.
I don't know him anymore.
A few nights ago, he started to scare me again, and I left.
When I came back the next morning, he was gone.
I haven't seen him since.
What's on these drives?
Jimmy was a combat videographer.
It's all footage from the war.
Do you mind if I stay for a bit, take a look at these?
Shit.
Jesus, what's that smell?
Mick, let's go!
No one called me about it.
You a doctor?
I'm the supervising physician.
And the receptionist, it looks like.
I'm here to talk to Jane Crenna.
Sorry, but that patient is heavily medicated.
All right, 10 minutes unless the patient is upset or interfered with in any way.
What is this place?
The isolation floor.
Maximum security.
Hello, Jane.
Do you remember me?
Do you know a man named Santino?
Mick.
Why'd you go visit him at the zoo?
Jane, what was the message Santino had for you?
Marvin.
Are you all right?
Gonna need a fucking HIV test.
I told you not to upset her!
Let's go get a drink.
Inside the lion habitat at the zoo.
I went back there this morning.
These are messages to the spirits of Babylon.
The images are Persian pictographs, but the words are in Latin.
That mixture has been around since before the time of Christ when the Romans occupied the Middle East.
But the Latin here refers to providing a "gateway" or "portal."
So these messages, they're references to doors?
There must be an invitation that opens a doorway before an evil entity can slip into our world.
Some people invite it themselves by dabbling in the occult.
Others are just victims of a curse, like this.
The message here provides a point of entry for the demonic.
Any other stereotypes you want to hit while I'm here?
And I've known a lot of cops, and you're exactly the type.
Seriously, why the priesthood?
I had a drug problem when I was younger.
Bad one.
One morning, I woke up naked in a pool of my own urine in the middle of Kenmore Square with a dirty needle of speedball still sticking out of my arm.
I had a choice, to live or die.
It always comes down to a choice.
I chose God.
I got sober through Narcotics Anonymous and joined the priesthood.
You're sober but you drink and smoke?
I'm NA, not AA.
They might kill me slowly, but they won't kill me fast.
Not like heroin.
What about you?
You know what stopped him?
You see, Father, as we speak, every day, out there, someone's getting hurt, ripped off, murdered, raped.
Where's God when all that's happening?
In the hearts of people like you, who put a stop to it.
I mean, we can talk all night about the problem of evil, but what about the problem of good?
She had grown up Catholic in Venezuela and was convinced that there was an evil presence in her home here in the Bronx.
As her priest, I began a ritual cleansing of the apartment, not because I believed that she was right, but because I thought it might put her mind at ease.
What happened during that cleansing changed me forever.
I now believe there was an evil presence in Claudia's house, because I watched it try to take possession of her daughter.
You'll hear three voices on the recording.
One belongs to me, one belongs to Claudia, and one of the voices is coming from a five-year-old girl.
Mommy?
Eventually, it retreated.
It let the girl go.
And from that moment on, I devoted myself to the study of demonology.
Every culture, every religion since humans dropped out of the trees has practiced exorcism.
Besides superhuman strength, each possessed person used an altered voice and had clairvoyant powers.
They knew things they could not have known.
Sure.
You know, I think it's no accident that you're the man who discovered these messages.
You seem to either be attracting evil, or you're uniquely able to detect it.
Even if you don't understand it.
I get hunches.
My partner calls it my "radar."
Maybe you have been called into the Work.
"The Work"?
You're the one who took a vow for celibacy.
She doesn't feel safe, because she needs you.
So do I.
You got to talk to me.
You know, I need to know.
I hope this isn't the best.
Jesus Christ.
The message he painted opened a door for the demonic.
Those who are susceptible can become possessed when they see this.
Why?
That's the mystery of primary evil.
Santino saw this message in Iraq, became possessed.
Now he's trying to recruit with it.
What this man is doing must be stopped.
He can't be allowed to keep creating these doorways.
Take a look at this.
Tell me you saw that.
I heard nothing.
No, you're not.
The painter in this video could be sending you messages.
Perhaps he knows your gift.
My "gift"?
Those hunches you get, what your partner calls your radar, we call it "the Discernment of Spirits."
You can sense what others can't.
It is a spiritual gift, but it also puts you at risk.
It makes you a target.
Arrested for violent assault two years ago when he was home between deployments.
Acquitted and arrest record expunged when the victim disappeared.
But his DNA sample was in the felony database along with a recent address.
I'll see the judge about the warrant.
Please?
We'll pop him when he shows.
I'm gonna run your bath, then it's time for bed, okay?
I heard scratching again, and the door wouldn't open!
Do you have a crucifix in your home?
Good.
That's a start.
If you have been called into the Work, you and your family are already in danger.
And now listen to me.
I can't help you any further unless you humble yourself before God.
We can do it right here.
This is spiritual evil you're dealing with, Sarchie.
You cannot fight it in the usual way.
Whatever your sins are, you need to face them now, because they will be used against you.
I guarantee you that.
I don't know, Father.
I can't do that.
Do you remember that tape I played you?
Claudia, the woman from Venezuela.
How could I forget?
What do you mean?
Less than a year after the ritual cleansing I did at Claudia's house, she and I relapsed together.
Several times a week, for months.
No pain, no anguish, no anxiety.
Total euphoria.
Funny you should say that.
And of course I assumed I would be defrocked.
I certainly deserved to be.
But you know what my parish priest told me?
"A saint is a life-giver."
He heard my full story, told me that if it happened again I would be defrocked, and I left his office committed to walking the path of grace.
So I do know how difficult it is.
But you need to unburden yourself, Sarchie.
Holy shit, there he is.
Stay in the car.
Don't be deceived by his tricks.
He's not here.
Basement, he's in the basement!
No, please, help me.
Help me.
Okay, push.
Are you fucking kidding me?
It's stuck, man.
God damn it!
Where's Butler?
I don't know.
Shit.
Butler?
Repeat, officer down!
If I'd gotten there sooner, he'd still be here.
You know that's not your fault.
I've neglected my wife and daughter for years now.
Shut them out.
I killed a man, Father.
Was he a good man?
He's wanted on 11 counts of child sexual assault, and now, two counts of child murder.
Let's get this guy off the street.
My blood ran ice cold.
Marvin, the sick fuck, he came back to have a second look.
And that's when I saw him.
I was like an animal.
I couldn't stop myself.
I didn't want to stop.
I just kept hitting him.
Are you certain the guy you killed was guilty?
I've tried telling myself he deserved to die.
But if that's true, why does this eat away at me every goddamn day?
Because even if he got what he deserved, what you gave him wasn't justice.
I absolve you from your sins.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
This is Sergeant Ralph Sarchie.
Her name is Jane Crenna.
Jen?
It was me.
It was me who made her jump.
Santino?
Are you in my house?
Get down!
They'll die if you don't find them.
Tell me where the fuck they are.
It's the only way you'll find them.
This guy's not human!
Go.
Leave me alone with him.
We'll perform the exorcism now.
There are six stages to exorcism.
Presence, Pretense, Breakpoint, Voice, Clash and Expulsion.
"The ceremony is about to begin."
"Come to the rescue of men, whom God has created in His likeness, and has redeemed from the tyranny of evil."
"I rebuke thee, devil!"
"In the name of Dominus, depart."
What you're feeling is the Presence, the first stage.
Are you okay?
The demon is trying to hide behind the personality of the possessed.
"In the name of Jesus, we refuse and rebuke this evil sent against us."
His mark is upon you!
My fuck.
This is the Breakpoint.
What does that mean?
We're about to hear the Voice.
I brought out the beast.
Silence.Silence.
I command you to tell me what I shall call you.
Your name, demon?
You didn't hear that?
My name is the Jungler.
Do you hear the Voice?
Is it giving you a name?
Desist, Jungler!
You know your peril is imminent, and your end is near!
Get ready.
For fucking what?
"By the precious blood of Christ, we command you to depart and go where the Lord sends you!"
Hold him down!
"Holy Cross, be my light, let not the dragon be my guide."
Be gone, demon!
Daniella Ann Sarchie.
And who presents this child to be baptized?
Jennifer and Ralph Sarchie.
Ralph Sarchie, do you renounce Satan and all of his works?
How did we end up here?
This place is horrible.
Smells like balls.
We don't belong in this shithole.
Hey, Sam.
I hate this job.
Riggan, they're ready for you.
Ask her what he did after she left him.
Poor Ed, my ass!
The guy was dangerous!
How did he screw up shooting himself in the mouth?
We lived like fugitives then.
I never knew if he was going to come out from behind a bush, or a car, and just start shooting.
Christ, what a nightmare.
Call 911!
Is he breathing?
Bleeding's the most honest thing he's done so far.
He's not that bad!
That wasn't an accident.
What do you mean?
I made it happen.
Are you drunk?
Just find me an actor... a good actor.
Woody Harrelson!
He's doing the prequel to the X-Men prequel.
How about, uh, Jeremy Renner?
Just make it go away.
Now go out there and do what you were born to do.
That down doesn't have half your talent... and he's making a fortune in that Tin Man get-up.
We were the real thing, Riggan.
We had it all.
We gave it away.
We handed these poseurs the keys to the kingdom.
You know I'm right.
Look at that.
These people don't know what you're capable of.
Why would somebody go from playing the leading a comic book franchise... to adapting Raymond Carver for the stage?
Like you said... that, uh, Barthes said, uh...
Uh, Roland Barthes was a French philosopher, and if you knew anything about the history of...
Now is it true you've been injecting yourself with semen from baby pigs?
I'm sorry, what?
As a method of facial rejuvenation?
Where did you read that?
It was tweeted by @ prostatewhispers.
No, I didn't do it.
Okay, I'll write you're denying it.
Are you at all afraid that people will say you're doing this play... to battle the impression you're a washed-up superhero?
No, absolutely not.
That's why... twenty years ago, I said no to Birdman 4.
Birdman 4?
The guys in publicity... want a Times feature, which is the worst idea right now.
What are you doing?
I don't want to look at this anymore.
That was a present from the crew.
Threatened to sue us.
What'd you say, Me?
I said, "Motherfucker, are you threatening me?
What pictures?
He has a thing for nuns in diapers.
Why do you care?
Point is, I made it go away.
That's great.
Yeah, it's fantastic, except for one thing.
We can't afford to lose any more money.
What do you think I should do?
Can I talk to you?
What's up?
You find another actor?
Mike's available.
Which is it, quit or fired?
He told me.
Do theater critics love him?
They want to spooge on him.
You think he'd come in this evening?
I'll call and find out.
I'll call his agent.
You'll find out.
Intimidating, isn't it?
You have any idea the people who have walked on these boards before you?
Thanks for coming in on such short notice, Mike.
This is what I do.
Well, thanks.
Well, it's a good theater.
Well, feel free to take the script up until you feel comfortable.
No, let's just do some of it.
Feed me a line.
Okay, uh, let me think.
The kind of love I'm talking about, you don't try to kill people!
How do you know the lines?
No, no, forget that.
Just stay with me.
"I'm the wrong person to ask," he says, but what's the intention?
Is he fed up with the subject?
Deflecting guilt over the marriage?
Make it work with one line.
"I didn't even know the man." Right?
Can I sit down for this?
So just give it to me as a "Fuck you." Lay it on me.
The kind of love that I'm talking about, you don't... you don't try to kill people.
You want to do this with me?
What do you think?
I'll take that as a yes.
So, who are you?
That's Sam, my daughter.
Welcome aboard, Mike!
Thank you, Captain.
Oh, I know who you are.
Your ass is great.
He's here.
You're just going to stand there?
We have to start from scratch with less than 24 hours.
Under the bed at home, I think.
Everything's too small.
Or pubic hair, I imagine.
What are you doing?
Waiting on Larry.
I'm finished!
Then I'm just standing here with my cock out.
I don't know if drugs fried her brain or what... but I don't want her running to her father saying you showed her your junk.
Then we should ask her to leave.
He's a handful, huh?
How do you always manage to find a new way to humiliate me?
Oh, to be fair, you make it really easy.
What was she doing here?
She brought me down.
And stayed?
Play with my balls.
I have to go shopping again.
It's a dream sequence.
And dancing midgets!
You didn't see what I just saw.
Okay, I'll do it.
She has a great ass.
I missed my last two periods.
I think it's really happening.
Well, you know, there's you, there's Jake, the masseur wore a condom... yeah, I'm pretty sure it's yours.
Idiot.
Are you excited?
Me, too.
You're not funny!
First preview tomorrow.
Here we go.
Oh, honey, can't we just go to dinner?
You've been what?
We all should be ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about... when we talk about love.
Oh, for God's sake, are you getting drunk?
I don't have to be drunk to say what I think.
You've had more than a few.
What, are you counting?
Shut up!
Anyway, like I was saying... you want to know about real love, there's this old couple... had a car wreck, out on the interstate.
Some drunk kid plowed his old man's pickup... right into their camper.
By the time I got down to the hospital, this kid, this fucking teenager, was dead.
So we took the old couple up to the O.R.
We worked like hell on them through most of the night.
By the time we were done with them, we just, you know... wrapped them in full body casts.
The husband, the old man... was depressed for the longest time.
So, I went up to the mouth hole and I asked him.
Can you imagine?
Shit.
Did you replace my gin with water, man?
"Come on," what?
If I need to be drinking gin, who the fuck are you to touch my gin?
Oh, come on, people, don't be so pathetic.
Does anybody give a shit about the truth other than me?
So I'm going to work with the chicken.
That was interesting.
Get him out of here!
How do you want me to do that?
Hey, wait.
I want him gone.
As soon as we announced he was taking over, the advance doubled.
We can't afford to lose any more money and we can't afford to lose Mike.
That's how you got me into this shit!
This isn't the '90s anymore.
Your zipper's down.
You were really good, Cabrón.
Out in front of the theater in ten minutes!
What the hell was going on up there?
I didn't know you were here tonight.
That guy's an asshole, huh?
What are you doing here?
Sam and I are going to grab a bite after she's finished.
So what's happening?
Oh, you know, it's great.
It's the same.
You understand where her head is at.
Of course.
She's trying to stay away from everything and everyone that got her into rehab in the first place.
You know what I mean.
Oh, sorry.
How's that going?
Yeah, I'm having a beer.
So... what's going on with you?
Nothing.
Everything's the same, I guess.
That's going to be Sam's house.
I need the money.
Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?
What's going on?
Riggan, look at me.
I got a chance to do something right.
We ended up flying through this really, really horrible storm.
I mean, the plane was rattling and shaking.
I just sat there.
Did you know Farrah Fawcett died the exact same day as Michael Jackson?
Is that crazy?
Why did we break up'?
Because you threw a kitchen knife at me... and an hour later, were telling me how much you loved me.
Just because I didn't like that ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie Hawn... did not mean I did not love you.
I Will.
You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan.
People would've wanted to see that.
The sun bed is here.
What does that mean?
It means there's a sun bed out there being delivered to in here.
Who ordered a sun bed?
He said he has to be a redneck.
Son of a bitch.
Did I do something to disrespect you?
Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige, my friend.
It means, my reputation is riding on this, and that's worth a, a...
But long after you're gone, I'll be on that stage... earning my living, baring my soul, wrestling with complex emotions, 'cause that's what we do.
Where are you going?
They have coffee here.
Thanks, Tommy.
You see the woman at the end of the bar'?
All that matters is what she writes about us in 500 words in the Times.
The only opinion that matters in New York theater is hers.
She does look like she licked a homeless guy's ass.
This is my town and to be honest, people don't give a shit about you here.
Would you mind having a picture with us here?
Would you mind?
The button's on the bottom.
Who is this guy?
He used to be Birdman.
I want to know something.
Why Raymond Carver?
I was a kid, in high school... doing a play in Syracuse, and he was in the audience.
And he sent this back afterwards.
Ray Carver."
He was fucking drunk, man.
You headed to Hollywood, Mike?
Hollywood's heading here, Tabby.
Good luck with that.
He's a Hollywood clown in a Lycra bird suit.
What will you be doing?
Don't you ever worry that I'll give you a bad review?
I'm sure you will... if I ever give you a bad performance.
Miss Dickinson.
Mr. Shiner.
What are you still doing here?
For what?
Okay, well, I just wanted to say that.
What is that?
That smell.
What is it?
You've got to be shitting me.
Can we not do this, please?
Dad?
Where is it?
I can't believe this.
What is this?
That's pot.
Relax.
"Relax." You can't do this to me.
You know what I'm talking about.
It's important to me!
It's my chance to finally do work that means something.
That means something to who?
You had a career, Dad, before the third comic book movie.
Before people started to forget who was inside that bird costume.
You are doing a play based on a book written 60 years ago... for a thousand rich old white people... whose only concern is where to have cake and coffee afterwards!
Nobody gives a shit but you!
And, let's face it, Dad... you are not doing this for the sake of art, you're doing it to feel relevant again.
And you act like it doesn't exist.
Things that are happening in a place you ignore... that has already forgotten about you!
I mean, who the fuck are you?
It's you who doesn't exist!
You're doing this because you're terrified, like the rest of us, that you don't matter.
Dad.
Lesley?
What?
I think I'm hard.
No, it's just sometimes you don't consider other people's feelings.
You've got to be kidding.
Cut it out!
Get off!
- Ed?
- Why?
What are you doing here?
Just tell me why.
Just don't do anything stupid.
Eddie, please!
What's the matter with me?
Why do I always have to beg people to love me?
Eddie, please, give me the gun.
Look at me.
I just wanted to be what you wanted.
Anybody-
I don't exist.
I'm not even here.
I'll fix the blood rig.
They're fucking in a motel room.
I told you to stop, you fucking animal.
You were brilliant.
I want your shit out of the apartment.
No, we can't, Mike!
Maybe up here, you're Mr. Truth... but in the real world, where it counts, you're a fucking fraud!
What'd he do now?
That's kind of hot!
I'm pathetic!
Look at me.
You know, I've always dreamed of being a Broadway actress... since I was a little kid.
And I keep waiting for someone to tell me I made it.
You made it.
I did?
Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner on a fake motel bed in front of 800 people.
Hey, is she okay?
Look, none of this is your fault, okay?
You're beautiful and you're talented... and I'm lucky to have you.
That was kind of sweet.
What's wrong?
We're gross.
Do it again.
You're not ready yet.
That's fine.
Your gun is ridiculous.
I can see the red plug in the barrel... so you look like a kid with a plastic toy when you point it at me.
I don't feel threatened at all.
I don't think it's high enough.
Me, neither.
What are you doing up here?
Uh, adrenaline.
You went to rehab?
Cool.
It wasn't all Dr. Drew or anything, but that dude from American Pie was there.
Jump!
Eat me!
I love this city.
Why do you act like a dick all the time?
Do you just do it to antagonize people?
Maybe.
You really don't give a shit if people like you or not.
Not really.
That's cool.
Is it?
I don't know.
What?
What are you, 78?
Truth.
When we first met, you made a comment about my ass.
Why did you do that?
Truth or dare?
Dare.
Truth.
No, it's too late.
Truth or dare?
Truth.
You're boring.
The truth is always interesting.
You want to fool around with me?
Really?
Why not?
That's a second question.
It's a second part.
I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up.
That didn't seem to be a problem for you onstage.
Nothing is a problem for me onstage.
I want to ask another question.
You already did.
If you weren't afraid, what would you want to do to me?
I'd pull your eyes out of your head...
That's sweet.
And put them in my own skull... and look around, so I could see the street the way I used to when I was your age.
Good night.
Don't kill the messenger.
He's an asshole.
I told you.
You fucking prick.
He's playing you-
This is it?
Where's the rest of it?
Don't worry... it'll be used to scoop up dog shit tomorrow.
How can you be so calm?
What are my other choices?
Aren't you scared at all?
About what?
About being humiliated out there!
It won't be the first time I've been humiliated.
Well, of course it won't.
You're an asshole.
And by the way, I'm not pregnant, so there's one thing not to worry about.
Forget about her.
Now two million people agree with him.
Get up!
Listen, this is my fucking show.
I did the work, I raised the money and I arrange the press!
My massive hard-on got 50,000 views on YouTube.
Because when he got us out there... that bastard would smile and say:
It's also not true.
Why don't you get your wings and your bird suit?
You are lame, Riggan... rolling around with that poncy theater fuck... in an 800-seat shithole like this.
Oh, you really fucked up this time.
It's pathetic.
Let's get the hell out of here while we can.
Stop that shit!
Leave me alone.
You were a movie star, remember?
Ignorant, but charming.
Now, you're just a tiny, bitter cocksucker.
I was fucking miserable.
FUCK you!
No, fuck you, you coward.
I don't know if you noticed, but that was 1992!
You could jump right back into that suit, if you wanted to.
I look like a turkey with leukemia!
I'm fucking disappearing.
We are not dead.
Oh, please, just stay dead.
I'm not fucking you!
I'm Riggan fucking Thomson!
What the hell did you do that for?
I liked that poster.
It's always "we, " brother.
Fuck you!
Thanks for stopping by.
You know I'm proud of you, don't you?
I know.
I think we should cancel the preview.
I'm tired, dude.
I can't do this anymore, Jake.
I can't.
That's a joke, right?
Really?
How is he?
He'll be fine.
You're an asshole, Jake!
I'm the one keeping this afloat!
Are you okay?
What for?
Tomorrow's my first opening night on Broadway.
Mine, too.
This is exciting.
We have a full house.
Jake just told me.
Yeah, it's great.
For fuck's sake, just jump already.
How'd you know I'd be up here?
Well, I didn't know, but I kind of hoped maybe.
Where is Lesley?
Smart girl.
You ready for your last preview?
Sure, yeah.
Who did that t0 you?
Could have been anybody, I guess.
I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley.
It wasn't Lesley.
Look at me.
He was right, though.
About what?
About your being special.
You've been hanging around here... trying to make yourself invisible behind this fragile little fuck-up routine... but you can't.
Truth or dare?
Truth or dare?
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Absolutely not.
How do you do it?
Do what?
Go out there every single night and pretend to be somebody else in front of all those people?
That's a shame.
What are we doing here?
What do you mean?
I mean, what are we doing here?
That was amazing!
Yeah, good, right?
It's actually going well.
I really am sorry.
Or Justin Bieber.
I really wanted to be a mom.
But my body doesn't seem to agree.
When I imagined myself on Broadway, I never saw the dancing reindeer.
Nice touch.
Hey, Jimmy, you got a smoke?
Dude, you rock!
What are you doing?
Waiting for Jake.
This is my attorney, Mr. Roth.
We're pursuing financial remunerations for the injuries...
I got a play to do!
As:
Shut up!
Eddie, please!
Why do I always... beg people to love me?
Eddie, please, just... just give me the gun.
I just wanted to be what you wanted.
Now I spend every fucking day... trying to be somebody I'm not!
Mr. Roth?
Okay, don't leave, please.
Is that a threat?
You seem sort of...
No, I'm good, I'm good.
Do you really think you'll be ready for opening tomorrow?
I'm not sleeping, like, you know... at all.
And, uh, this play is kind of starting to feel like... a miniature, deformed version of myself that just keeps... following me around and, like... hitting me in the balls with, like, a tiny little hammer.
I'm sorry, what was the question?
Never mind.
Tonight wasn't bad.
Yeah, really?
Yeah, I think people liked it.
So, each dash represents a thousand years.
And, um, this... is how long humans have been here.
150,000 years.
I think they're trying to remind us that that's all our ego and self-obsession are worth.
I was a shitty father, wasn't I?
I can't...
Dad?
You just wiped out the entire human race.
There it goes.
I'm sorry.
You're becoming a trending topic.
Really?
I should probably tell you about this before anybody else does.
350,000 views in less than an hour.
Believe or not, this is power.
That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.
That was... twenty years before I put on that goddamn outfit.
I don't care.
I'm going to destroy your play.
Actually, you did.
And I'm going to close your play.
Would you like to know why?
Because I hate you, and everyone you represent.
Handing each other awards for cartoons and pornography.
Measuring your worth in weekends?
Well, this is the theater.
You don't get to come here and pretend you can write, direct and act... in your own propaganda piece without coming through me first.
Did you even see it?
Let me read it.
I will call the police.
"Callow." Callow is a label.
"Lackluster." That's just a label.
It sounds like you need penicillin to clear that up.
That's so fucking lazy.
You're a lazy fucker.
Because you can't see this thing if you don't know how to label it.
You mistake those noises in your head for true knowledge.
Are you finished?
It's just a bunch of crappy opinions... backed up by even crappier comparisons.
Well, I'm a fucking actor.
This play cost me everything.
You're no actor, you're a celebrity.
Let's be clear on that.
I'm going to kill your play.
A pint of whiskey, please.
Where you going, man?
Was that too much?
I was just trying to give you a rage.
God, you look like shit, brother.
You get that mongoloid look when you're hung over.
It's a beautiful day.
Forget about the Times... everyone else has-
You tower over these other theater douchebags.
You're a movie star, man!
Good for you.
You're the original.
You paved the way for these other clowns.
The Phoenix Rises.
Pimple-faced gamers creaming in their pants.
A billion worldwide, guaranteed!
You are larger than life, man.
You save people from their boring, miserable lives.
That's what I'm talking about.
And the next time you screech... it'll explode into millions of eardrums.
You'll glimmer on thousands of screens around the globe.
Another blockbuster.
You are a god.
See?
There you go, you motherfucker.
Gravity doesn't even apply to you.
Wait till you see the faces of those who thought we were finished.
You are...
Birdman!
A film!
You people are full of shit!
Hey, man, can I help you?
Be careful.
Music.
You okay, man?
You want me to call somebody for you?
Do you know where to go?
I know where to go.
Above them all.
Stop the music.
It's going really well.
Places for the final scene, Riggan.
Look at all these roses.
Are you okay?
I am calm.
I'm great, actually.
Kind of scary, but it is comforting.
Can I tell you something funny?
Do you remember?
You fucked Janet Rossbach in our bed.
I just sat on the beach for a while, looking out at the ocean.
I was up to my chest when I felt the first one.
The water was full of jellyfish.
They were all over me.
You said it was a sunburn.
I know.
And you believed me.
To be honest, I didn't give a shit.
I love you.
I really wish I hadn't videotaped her birth.
Why?
You know... just the three of us.
But I wasn't.
I wasn't even present in my own life, and now I don't have it... and I'm never going to have it.
You have Sam.
No, she's just going through...
Yeah, like?
That mustache.
Last chance for "places."
You better get back to your seat.
What's the matter with me?
Eddie, please, give me the gun.
Now I spend every fucking minute trying to be something else, something I'm not.
You don't, do you?
I'm sorry.
I don't exist.
Is he up?
He just woke up.
I thought I lost you, buddy.
What the hell happened?
I was watching you onstage and all of a sudden... you had that goofy look in your eye and you just...
What is that?
You have to be shitting me.
Read it.
I don't believe this. "The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"?
Read it.
You're happy about this?
This is the kind of review that turns people into living legends!
He shot the nose off his face!
He got a new nose!
And if doesn't like that one, we'll get him a new one!
This play is going to last forever.
It's going to open in London, Paris.
The studio will call, we're going to get book deals... you'll see.
Why aren't you saying anything?
This is what you wanted, wasn't it?
Riggan, this is what you wanted.
Yeah, this is what I wanted.
If anybody talks to you about it, it was an accident.
An accident.
You motherfuckers, this is a hospital!
Get the fuck out of here!
Lilacs.
Are you laughing?
What's so funny?
I can't smell them.
What are you doing?
Posting a photo of you on your Twitter page.
I have a Twitter page?
Yeah, I set it up today.
I'm just kidding.
You got 80,000 followers in less than a day.
Really?
I'm going to scare the shit out of them.
Uh, I'm going to get a vase for the flowers.
Bye-bye... and fuck you.
I believe we have a choice in this world about how to tell sad stories.
I like that version as much as the next girl does, believe me.
It's just not the truth.
Late in the winter of my seventeenth year... my mother decided that I was depressed.
The booklets and the websites always list depression as a side effect of cancer.
Support groups can be a great way for you to connect with people who are...
All right.
We're here with J.C.
Basically, they found it in his nuts... they cut most of it out, and he almost died, but he didn't die.
Who's next?
Hazel?
Uh, thyroid, originally... but now with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs.
And how are you doing?
Uh, you mean besides the terminal cancer?
All right, I guess.
We're here for you, Hazel.
Why don't I play another song?
Hey, sweet pea.
So... was it awesome?
"Yeah, Mom, it was awesome!"
And that was my life.
Mom, if you want me to be a teenager, you don't send me to support group.
Well, that is the kind of thing I would know with a fake ID.
Can you just get in the car, please?
The only thing worse than biting it from cancer... is having a kid bite it from cancer.
Sorry.
My bad.
I'm sorry.
No, I'll share.
I have retinoblastoma.
We had surgery on one eye when I was younger... so this is a glass eye.
And then I'm going in to the hospital to have another surgery... to take out the other eye.
So, after that surgery, I'm just gonna be totally blind.
Thank you.
Your turn, Gus.
Yeah, sure.
Um, I'm Augustus Waters.
I'm 18 years old and I had a touch of osteosarcoma about a year-and-a-half ago.
So, I've lost this baby as a result.
And, uh, now I'm part cyborg, which is awesome.
But, really, I'm just here at Isaac's request.
And how are you feeling, Gus?
I'm grand, yeah.
I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend.
Maybe you'd like to share your fears with the group?
My fears?
Oblivion.
To be remembered.
So, I'd say if I have any fears, it would be to not do that.
Would anyone else in the group like to speak to that?
Hazel?
Unexpected.
I just want to say that there's gonna come a time when all of us are dead.
There was a time before humans and there's gonna be a time after.
It could be tomorrow, it could be a million years from now.
And when it does, there will be no one left... to remember Cleopatra or Muhammad Ali or Mozart... let alone any of us.
Oblivion's inevitable.
And if that scares you, then I suggest you ignore it.
God knows it's what everyone else does.
Well, that's some good advice.
"Literally."
I thought we were in a church basement... but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus.
Oh, yeah.
No, what's your full name?
Hazel Grace Lancaster.
What?
Because you're beautiful.
They probably texted "always" to each other 14 million times this year.
He's got to be hurting her boob.
No, I mean now.
You could be an axe murderer.
There's always that possibility.
That is disgusting.
And yours is even though you had freaking cancer... you're willing to give money to a corporation... for the chance to acquire even more cancer?
Let me just tell you that not being able to breathe sucks!
It totally sucks.
"Hamartia"?
It's a fatal flaw.
Ah, a fatal...
Hazel Grace, they don't actually hurt you unless you light them.
It's a metaphor, see?
A metaphor.
So, tell me about you.
Um, I was 13 when they found it.
Pretty much worst-case scenario.
Thyroid, stage four.
And then one day, my lungs started filling up with water.
You can let go, sweetie.
Don't be afraid.
That should have been the end.
Oh, my God.
So, are you back in school?
Welcome to my humble abode.
Uh, my folks call them "encouragements."
Don't ask.
Hi, guys!
It's an impressive collection.
Yeah, I used to play.
Sorry, the, um, stairs... and the standing...
Yeah, I understand.
Seriously, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I already told you.
Your interests, your hobbies, your passions, your weird fetishes.
An Imperial Affliction.
Wait, does it have zombies in it?
Okay, what's it about?
Uh, cancer.
It's about cancer?
This haunting, yet brilliant novelization of my favorite video game.
"Counterinsurgence."
Well, thank you.
Wait, your hands are so cold.
Well, they're not so much cold as just under-oxygenated.
That's different.
Did he give it to you?
Hey, don't worry.
I did something with the dessert... just to try to keep the goji berry theme going.
Hazel Grace.
Welcome to the sweet torture of reading An Imperial Affliction.
Isaac, does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse?
Hello?
Isaac, Hazel's here.
How you doing?
I'm doing okay.
It seems Isaac and Monica are no longer a going concern.
Oh, Isaac, I'm so sorry.
However, you know, it doesn't hurt to talk to him... if you have any sage words of feminine advice.
I actually think that his response is fairly appropriate.
"Pain demands to be felt."
You're quoting my book.
She said she wanted to break up with me before the surgery... because she couldn't handle it.
I'm about to lose my eyesight, and she can't handle it.
You know, sometimes... people don't understand the promises that they're making when they make them.
I just want to kick something.
I've been wanting to call you for a few days now... but I've been waiting until I could form a coherent thought about An Imperial Affliction.
One second.
Isaac.
Try this.
Always!
And I feel like ending your book in the middle of a sentence... violates that contract, don't you think?
Like Anna's mother.
Yes, and the Dutch Tulip Man.
Have you tried contacting this Peter Van Houten fellow?
I've written him so many letters, but he's never responded.
Apparently, he moved to Amsterdam and became a recluse, and...
That's the thing about pain.
Hazel Grace.
You're welcome.
However, we do need closure, don't you think?
That is exactly what I was asking Van Houten for in my letters.
But he never responded.
Um, nope.
Augustus?
Yes?
Shall I continue?
Augustus, keep reading, keep reading!
So, yeah, that just happened.
Do you think that I...
My friend Augustus Waters... who read your book at my recommendation... just received an email from you at this address.
I hope you will not mind that he shared that email with me.
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind answering a few questions I have... about what happens after the end of the book.
Specifically the following.
Does Anna's mom marry the Dutch Tulip Man?
And is the Dutch Tulip Man up to something... or is he just completely misunderstood?
Lastly, I was hoping you could shed some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.
These questions have haunted me for years... and I don't know how long I have left to get answers to them.
"Frankly, I'd read your grocery lists.
"Yours, with great admiration, Hazel Grace Lancaster."
Not bad.
Is it really 1:00 AM?
I should probably go to sleep.
Perhaps "okay" will be our "always."
Oh, my God.
What?
"Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten."
Hey, you, I am so sorry.
It's okay.
Why don't you just ask the Genies?
Not Disney.
Hazel Grace, you did not go to Disney World.
It was actually a really fun trip!
I can't believe I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes.
Terrible.
You coming?
The most important thing in any MRI... is to lie completely still.
But that day, it was almost impossible.
Um, I would love to go on a picnic with you.
Shall we?
So, uh... you're a survivor yourself, huh?
How's your health now?
Every last one of them.
That's probably why I'm still a virgin.
You are not still a virgin.
Are you really?
Let me show you something.
See this circle?
And this... is 18-year-old dudes with one leg.
Funky Bones by Joep Van Lieshout.
Sandwich?
Sorry, the tomatoes are Mexican.
Think about that.
You do love your symbols.
Speaking of which, you're probably wondering... why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich... and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey.
It actually has crossed my mind.
Well, Hazel Grace, like so many before you... and listen, I say this with the utmost of affection... you used your wish moronically.
You were young, impressionable... the Grim Reaper staring you right in the face... and it led you to rush into making a wish you didn't really want.
But, how could little Hazel Grace, having never read An Imperial Affliction... know that her one true wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten... in his Amsterdam exile.
But I didn't save it, so...
It's a good thing I saved mine.
So, you're saying...
I'm not gonna give you my wish or anything, Hazel.
If that's what you're thinking.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Augustus!
I don't know if they do this that often, but they're willing to bring me, too, and...
Okay.
Well, not all cancers are alike, and yours is particularly unusual, Hazel.
The only way I could ever authorize a trip like this would be if someone familiar with your case...
What if my mom came?
Wait, what?
What if you came?
That just might work.
And then this happened.
So, what happened?
The usual.
Fluid in the lungs preventing oxygenation.
The good news is... no tumor growth.
No new tumors in your body.
We're so relieved.
This is just a thing, Hazel.
It's a thing we can live with.
Mr. Lancaster.
How's she doing?
Better.
- Gus, listen, why don't you go home?
Get some rest.
The truth is... very few people have been on Phalanxifor as long as Hazel has.
We really don't know the long-term effects.
What we're trying to do is prevent endothelial growth... which, when overexpressed, can contribute to disease, decay... vascular inhibition... and the spread of the tumors we're working so hard to eradicate.
The survival rate of patients with severe endothelial growth... decreases exponentially the more the condition advances.
Oh, my God.
I'm not gonna be a mom anymore.
I have a question.
Yes, Hazel?
Can I still go to Amsterdam?
But they have oxygen on airplanes.
I don't know any other way to say this, Hazel.
You're just too sick.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Yeah, just a sec.
Sorry, she's asleep.
I know what you're thinking.
It's not fair to him.
It's not.
He doesn't need this in his life.
Nobody does.
A lot more trouble than it's worth.
I'm serious.
We're not sentimental people.
Hazel Grace.
Hi, Augustus.
Are you okay?
No.
What's the matter?
Talk to me.
I don't know.
Everything.
I want to go to Amsterdam, Gus.
And I want Van Houten to tell us what happens after his book.
I also don't really want this particular life.
Well, I demand to see this swing set of tears.
I do see your point.
This is one sad swing set.
Hazel Grace, I hope you realize... that you trying to keep your distance from me in no way lessens my affection for you.
All your efforts to keep me from you are gonna fail.
I like you.
And I like hanging out with you and everything... but I can't let this go on any further.
Why not?
Because I don't want to hurt you.
Gus, I'm a grenade.
A grenade?
I mean, that's why I don't have a hamster.
Well, we gotta do something about this frickin' swing set.
That's why.
In case you're wondering, that's why I like you, Hazel Grace.
You're just so busy being you, you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.
Friends.
Mom?
Yeah?
- What's wrong?
Did you email the Genies to tell them that the trip was off?
Because Van Houten's assistant just emailed me... and she said that she thinks we're still coming.
What?
I was supposed to tell you with your dad.
We're going to Amsterdam.
We're going to Amsterdam.
I love you so much.
I love you.
Call him!
Mom, we're going to Amsterdam!
We are going to Amsterdam, right now.
Hello, Lancasters.
I'm really sorry about that.
No, it's totally fine.
It's called a "cannula." And it helps me breathe.
See this little friend right here?
He feeds oxygen through your tube.
Wow, yeah, that's something.
I think I'm breathing better.
I would love to give it to you, but I kind of could use the help.
Have you never been on a plane before?
Well, that metaphor, it's prohibited on today's flight.
We're flying!
You two are so adorable.
We're just friends.
Well, she is, I'm not.
Get away from her, you bitch!
Oh, I'm gonna check us in.
Is that for me?
What, you're saying that you're totally fine... with your teenage daughter running free with an older boy... in a city that's famous for its vice and debauchery is totally fine with you?
Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what I'm saying.
Oh, you look so handsome!
I hear this restaurant is unbelievable.
You look gorgeous.
Thanks.
This is it.
Your table, Mr. and Mrs. Waters.
Thank you.
That is amazing.
Do you know what Dom Pérignon said after he invented champagne?
Welcome to Oranjee.
Would you like a menu, or will you have the chef's choice?
We have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends.
- Ooh! - I think that's ours.
And for the gentleman.
I want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person... so that I can take it to Vegas and marry it.
I like your suit.
When I first got sick... they told me I had an 85 percent chance of being cancer-free.
I don't necessarily think I'd wear it on a date, though.
So, we're on a date?
Hey, you watch it.
We are Mr. and Mrs. Waters.
God?
What about you?
I mean, otherwise... what's the point?
Maybe there is no point.
I won't accept that.
I am in love with you.
You heard me.
Sorry.
More stars?
No, thank you.
I think we'll just have the check.
No, sir.
Your meal has been paid by Mr. Van Houten.
What?
I don't really get that shirt.
There are, like, fifty Magritte references in An Imperial Affliction.
"This is not a pipe."
Nor is a T-shirt of a drawing of a thing, the thing itself.
Who's ready for some answers?
Me!
This is it.
Get out of here.
They are Augustus and Hazel... the young fans with whom you've been corresponding.
The Americans?
You invited them.
Please, come in.
You know why I left America, Lidewij.
To never have to encounter Americans.
You're American.
I will not do this, Peter.
Please, be nice.
Come in, please.
Sorry, let me clear this for you.
Thank you.
Which of you is Augustus Waters?
I am.
And that's Hazel.
Mr. Van Houten, thank you so much for writing back to us.
Clearly an error in judgment.
Yours are the first missives to which I've replied, and look where it got me.
Just me, then, Lidewij.
Another scotch and soda, please.
Perhaps some breakfast first, Peter?
She thinks I have a drinking problem.
I also think the Earth is round.
So, you like my book.
- No pressure.
Kind of.
It was our pleasure.
You've come a long way.
What can I do for you?
We have some questions... obviously, about what happens at the end of your book.
How familiar are you with Swedish hip-hop?
I would say, limited.
Uh, Lidewij, play Bomfalleralla immediately.
Okay.
The important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying... but what the voices are feeling.
Are you messing with us?
Like, is this some sort of performance?
Gus, sit down.
All right, so at the end of the book, Anna's...
Let's imagine you're racing a tortoise.
The tortoise has a ten-yard head start.
In the time it takes you to run ten yards... the tortoise has moved maybe one yard, and so on, forever.
Now, certainly, you can run past the tortoise... as long as you don't contemplate the mechanics involved.
I assume that answers your question.
Yet you seemed so intelligent in print, Mr. Waters.
Has the cancer found its way into your brain?
Peter.
I am not interested in talking about that book.
But they can't!
I refuse to pity you in the manner in which you are accustomed.
Peter, that's enough.
You are a side-effect to an evolutionary process... that cares little for individual lives.
You are a failed experiment in mutation.
Listen, douchepants... there is nothing that you're gonna tell me about my disease... that I don't already know.
I came here for one thing and one thing only.
That is for you to tell me what happens at the end of this goddamn book!
I want you to leave.
Have you ever stopped to ask yourself... why you care so much about your silly questions?
Oh, go fuck yourself.
I'll write you a sequel.
So sorry that I spent your wish on that asshole.
Hazel and Augustus!
I'm very sorry.
Circumstance has made him cruel.
He is not invited.
I'm afraid there's no elevator.
It's difficult in times like these.
It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals.
They seem so absurd and impractical... yet I cling to them because I still believe... in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.
Shall we?
Don't worry, take your time.
Sorry.
All is as it should be.
God wishes to see people happy.
Yeah.
This is it, look.
The only member of the Frank family to survive was Otto.
Anne's father.
Try to recapture the happiness within yourself.
Think of all the beauty in everything around you... and be happy.
I fell in love with him the way you fall asleep.
Slowly, and then all at once.
Gus... get over yourself.
Wait.
I can't, it's stuck.
I love you so much, Augustus Waters.
I love you too, Hazel Grace.
So, so much.
Augustus, I can't breathe.
Oh, my God.
Then what happened?
We just walked around.
That sounds lovely.
Oh, my gosh, we probably still have a few hours, right?
Could you just not be ridiculous right now, please?
Do you think Hazel and I can just have a little time alone?
Sure, Gus.
Um, I am gonna run to the room... and be ready whenever you guys want to do something.
Want to go for a walk?
What is it?
So, I had a PET scan... and it lit up like a Christmas tree.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.
It's so unfair.
Apparently, the world is not a wish-granting factory.
I'm gonna find a way to hang around here and annoy you for a long time.
Are you in pain?
No.
I'm okay.
Okay.
I don't suppose you can just forget about this?
You know, just treat me like I'm not dying.
I don't think you're dying, Augustus.
You've just got a touch of cancer.
Probably.
I would love to do that.
Thank you.
You guys are cute.
Makes me sick.
You guys are gross.
Have you heard from Monica?
Nope, not a thing.
In support group, there's this new girl... and she has these humongous...
How do you even know that?
Do you happen to have five dollars?
Okay, so, now what?
Now I know exactly where to line it up.
That was so exhilarating!
Your daughter, she's done a great injustice.
So we've come here seeking revenge.
This feels so good!
Augustus?
Hazel Grace.
Babe, what's going on?
Look.
Gus, it's infected.
Take a deep breath.
I wanted to buy cigarettes.
I don't know what happened to my pack.
No!
My name is Hazel Grace Lancaster.
But that is not what happened.
A story?
Or, like, a poem?
How's he doing?
What about the chemo?
I'm just gonna hang out for a while, if you don't mind.
Yeah, of course.
I mean, I was supposed to be special.
You think that the only way to lead a meaningful life... is for everyone to remember you, for everyone to love you.
You get me, and you get your family, and you get this world, and that's it.
And if that's not enough for you, then I'm sorry, but it's not nothing.
Because I love you.
Oh, Augustus.
One of the less bullshitty conventions of the cancer genre... is the convention known as the "Last Good Day"... when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued... when the pain is, just for a minute, bearable.
The problem, of course, is that there's no way of knowing... that your last good day is your last good day.
Good evening, Hazel Grace.
I may have.
I'm aggressively un-hungry.
Hazel, I know Gus is sick, but you got to take care of yourself.
"Stay healthy"?
Why would you say that to me?
It's the greatest thing I'll ever be.
That is my biggest fear, Mom.
When I am gone... you're not gonna have a life anymore.
You're just gonna sit and you're gonna stare at walls... or you're gonna off yourselves or...
Hazel, honey, we're not gonna do that.
I'm taking classes in social work.
You know, if I can take what we've been through... and help other people, maybe counsel families...
Mom, how could you not tell me this?
Beautiful.
I know, right?
What's going on, guys?
Tell her, Gus.
I wanted to attend my own funeral.
Ready?
To the right, a little bit.
It's down to you, Hazel Grace.
Ours was an epic love story... and I probably won't be able to get more than a sentence out... without disappearing into a puddle of tears.
I'm not gonna talk about our love story, because I can't.
So, instead, I'm gonna talk about math.
I am not a mathematician, but I do know this.
There are infinite numbers between zero and one.
There's point-one, point-one-two, and point-one-one-two, and... and an infinite collection of others.
Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between zero and two... or between zero and a million.
Some infinities are simply bigger than other infinities.
A writer that we used to like taught us that.
You know, I want more numbers... than I'm likely to get.
And, God... do I want more days for Augustus Waters than what he got.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
It was unbearable.
The whole thing.
Every second, worse than the last.
One of the first things they ask you in the ER... is to rate your pain on a scale from one to ten.
I've been asked this question hundreds of times... and I remember once... when I couldn't catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire... the nurse asked me to rate the pain.
Though I couldn't speak, I held up nine fingers.
Later, when I started feeling better... the nurse came in and she called me a fighter.
"You know how I know?" she said.
"You called a ten a nine."
But that wasn't the truth.
I didn't call it a nine because I was brave.
The reason I called it a nine was because I was saving my ten.
And this was it.
This was the great and terrible ten.
Augustus Waters fought hard for many years.
We thank You, Lord, for the life of Augustus Waters...
We need to fake-pray now.
...for his strength and his courage.
Lord, we ask that You be with us today, that You be close... that You comfort his friends and family.
Thank You for Your presence, Lord.
All this we pray in Jesus' name.
Not that it really matters, but I was his girlfriend.
There's a beautiful quote in Gus' home that reads...
"If you want the rainbow, you have to deal with the rain."
He was always able to crack a smile.
But that's okay.
I knew this was the right thing to do.
Funerals, I'd decided, are not for the dead.
They're for the living.
You spoke beautifully.
May I?
Omnis cellula e cellula.
But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral... and tell you what became of Anna and her mother... so here I am.
And that's your answer, "Omnis cellula e cellula."
"Life comes from life."
I remind a lot of people of a lot of people.
My daughter was eight.
And she suffered beautifully for so long.
She had leukemia like Anna?
Just like Anna.
Are you familiar with the Trolley Problem?
You are a drunk, and you're a failure... and I need you to get out of my car right now... so that I can go home, and be by myself and grieve!
You'll want to read this.
Can I come in?
It was a privilege, though, wasn't it?
Gives you an idea how we feel about you.
There's a friend here to see you.
Do you know if it hurt or whatever?
Apparently he was struggling for breath for a long time... and then eventually he just went unconscious.
It wasn't great or anything.
Dying sucks.
Gus really loved you, you know?
I know.
Well, I was talking to him at the cemetery... and he said he came all this way to give that letter to you.
Yeah, well, I'm over it.
I have no interest in reading another word of that asshole's again.
Apparently Gus wrote something down and then sent it to Van Houten.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person, but a shitty writer.
You're a shitty person, but a good writer.
I think we'd make a good team.
I don't want to ask you for any favors... but if you have the time, and from what I saw, you have plenty... please fix this for me.
See, the thing is, we all want to be remembered.
But Hazel's different.
Hazel knows the truth.
Maybe she wasn't loved widely, but she was loved deeply.
And isn't that more than most of us get?
When Hazel was sick, I knew I was dying... but I didn't want to say so.
She was in the ICU, and I snuck in for 10 minutes... and I sat with her, before I got caught.
And I willed myself to imagine a world without us... and what a worthless world that would be.
She's so beautiful.
She's funny without ever being mean.
I love her.
You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world... but you do have a say in who hurts you.
And I like my choices.
I hope she likes hers.
Okay, Hazel Grace?
Okay.
You got a fuckin' problem?
- Juliet, Mr. Proctor here?
What the hell is going on in here?
Burton, why don't you get Mr. Camden a drink on his way out?
See you next week.
What the hell was that about?
Are you implying I may not have been truthful... with the FBI?
You've been a big help, as always.
Oh, by any chance, do you remember the last time you saw... either one of those men?
It's fascinating how the mind... makes connections like that.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now we have yet to fully calculate... the losses sustained in the explosion...
I've been chief less than two months... and he's already planning a coup.
And in those two months, our hotel project has been destroyed and now our casino has been robbed.
Those are not unrelated events.
I'd have a lot more faith in his intentions... if he weren't angling to be chief himself.
That may be, but his ambitions don't in any way mitigate the troubles we've been having.
I'm very aware of the problems we've been having, Mr. Thompson.
We're just trying to do our duty to the tribe.
Don't get ahead of yourself, George.
And don't ever tell me how to honor my father again.
I'll see you all at the next meeting.
Jesus Christ.
Congratulations.
I just didn't know how else to get a hold of you.
But I want you to know that I left here three years ago angry and drunk, and I'm neither of those things anymore.
This is my best shot.
It's okay, Emmett.
Emmett, I got this.
Sheriff, I need you to sign off on these reports.
- What do you got?
What's up?
Breece Connors, Siobhan's ex-husband.
So what was that about?
A job he's after.
He wants me to lift the restraining order.
I've reviewed the police reports... from the night in question... and considered the mitigating factors... as well as the recommendation of the DA's office, and the agreement of the attorneys present.
Based on minimum sentencing guidelines, and the recommendation of the prosecution, you're hereby sentenced to serve no less than 30 days at the Mercer County Women's State Correctional.
Prisoner is to be remanded into custody immediately.
Can you at least stay the sentence for 72 hours... so that Mrs. Hopewell, who is the mother of two children, can get her affairs in order, please?
We're good with that, Your Honor.
Is that why you let her go to jail?
It's what you do, isn't it?
Just enjoying the view.
Okay, I'm giving you 10 minutes... and then I'm coming back for you.
Breece, what are you doing?
You okay?
Emmett's got a big mouth.
Just leave it alone, okay?
Please?
You know, I don't want to seem insensitive, but I need...
Racine's not interested in you and Job.
We get off, just like that?
What do you want, your own hearing?
Oh, no, thank you.
I just think we need to worry about... a high-ranking federal agent... who doesn't seem to answer to anyone.
Your cut, baby.
Yours, too.
What the fuck you lookin' at?
It's just sometimes I just forget how...
Never mind.
Definitely not our finest hour.
This one is hers.
I'll let you hang on to it.
So she's really going in?
Locked up, is locked up.
Okay, here's something new.
What are you doing here, Breece?
I heard from some of the guys that you had a fire.
Do you need something from inside?
No, I just wanted to see you.
I'm going away soon, and...
I'm sorry, I thought I was gonna be gone before you got back home.
You can't come in.
I'm still his mother, Deva, and yours.
- I don't give a shit, Mom.
Just stay away from us.
No, thanks.
Shut the fuck up, man.
Well, well, look who's back.
But now you can make up for it.
Don't thank me yet.
This better be good.
Besides, he owes us a lot more money... than what we'll ask him for.
George Hunter is gunning for you.
You need a win to keep this council quiet.
She just brings Proctor to the table.
I haven't seen her.
Well, she didn't come home last night.
- I'm still waiting for my money.
- Put her on the phone now.
Well, then, I guess we'll consider it a down payment on the casino you blew up.
I need you to go get her back.
I have no jurisdiction on the reservation.
Easy.
I'm sure your uncle will be here soon.
I'm sure he will be, too.
I used to see you at the farmers' market.
Your family sold pies, right?
Now you've left that behind, moved into another family business.
I think you know exactly what I mean.
You know, my people have this myth... about the Thunder Man.
But outwardly, he looks like a normal man.
So every man has to ask himself... whether he might in fact be, the Thunder Man.
And every woman has to wonder whether the man she's with is him.
Some women live to find him.
Others know that he'll destroy them if they stay with him.
I believe you think you found your Thunder Man.
Did your uncle rob my truck?
My uncle sells meat.
Your uncle blew up my fucking hotel.
If I were you, I'd be more worried about what he's going to do to you.
We'll see about that.
And by "we," I mean you.
You should be in the kitchen now.
Excuse me, Sheriff, are you lost?
Okay, the most isolated room is the VIP room.
Best guess?
Take a left at the end of the hall.
I could be hacking Google, or the Caymans, but, no, I gotta be infiltrating Fort Apache.
I could shoot you.
We could shoot each other.
That sounded nasty.
Hi yourself.
You think you know someone?
I know, right?
I'm sorry, am I missing something?
I just get involved when you start kidnapping young women.
Now cut her loose.
Well, you're in no position to make demands here.
I wouldn't be so sure.
So we can chalk this whole thing up... to one big misunderstanding.
You let her go now, this never happened.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Thanks.
Are you kidding me?
We're not gonna shoot a sheriff.
It was a bad idea to begin with.
I'm done sending messages.
It's time to take a more direct approach.
Don't mention it.
You shouldn't be living there.
Well, then, let me live with you.
I'm not a good man either.
I'm gonna go get something to eat.
So how did it go?
Piece of cake.
Like you said, I owed you one.
Sheriff... you never did ask me if I robbed that truck.
This is nice.
It's stunning.
What do you think?
You look beautiful.
Proctor, what the fuck?
Yeah, your security personnel weren't very effective.
You may want to talk to them when they wake up.
This is very romantic.
Get the fuck out of here.
What the fuck is this?
Every single one of them I can get my hands on.
I'll fucking drown you in their blood.
I'm not even going to ask.
Figured I'll be seeing you tomorrow.
Yeah, well, there's not much of a difference... between my motel room and a cell, so I figured I'd get a drink while I still could.
It's 30 days.
That's not long enough for the walls... to start fucking with your head, okay?
Anyone messes with you... you don't engage.
You keep to yourself, do quiet time.
It's not prison I'm worried about.
That'll all work itself out.
You just have to give them time.
You should get some sleep.
We got a long drive tomorrow.
You okay?
This is all on me.
She's going to jail, 'cause of me.
You did 15 years for her.
It doesn't make it right.
Look, I think you didn't consider... what would happen to her when you set up shop here, but no one does a stretch like you did... without making some mistakes when they first come out.
- Now you tell me.
- No, I think I told you then.
Listen, you can sit here and get drunk... while you dissect everything you've gone through.
You remember what I said.
Quiet time.
Look at this bitch.
Fuckin' Malibu Barbie coming to do time.
Hey, Squirrel.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'd cook and then we'd dance right in the kitchen.
I thought you weren't drinking.
Careful, now.
I'm trying to be gracious here, to make amends.
You're gonna shoot me, Squirrel?
Is that it?
Big fucking cop now, huh?
- Hey, Alma, what's up?
- You tried her cell?
Siobhan.
What's up, boss?
You expecting someone else?
I wasn't expecting anyone.
You want to talk about it?
Not really.
Then just tell me where he's staying.
Fuckin' Dream House Barbie.
You got a fuckin' problem, Barbie?
You hurt?
I'm good.
I know I'll lose my badge for this.
I'm on probation, for fuck's sake.
He won't stick around.
Go home.
You know, for the last four years, there wasn't a day that I didn't imagine... some version of this playing out.
How does it feel?
Better than I imagined.
Thanks, boss.
Don't mention it.
Yourmotherhas told you many lies, Deva.
- And nothing and no one else is more important than that.
You got a visitor.
You coming?
- Making friends?
- You know me.
You getting any more time for it?
They just let me off with a warning.
He's alive.
I put my kids in harm's way.
Thank you.
Just keep your head down, okay?
My Grandfather says green eyes are a sign of the devil.
Maybe he's right.
Iputthatinthecategory of crazy shit old Injuns believe.
Sometimes I wonder what planet you come from.
And out of the ground, the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air.
Want a bite?
We have got to get out of here.
- Right now?
- No, not right now.
The first chance I get, I'm gone.
Is it really that bad on the reservation?
Our parents tell us how we were this great warrior tribe, but now everyone's on drugs or in jail or getting killed.
It's a big world out there.
And whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereon.
You miss Rebecca, don't you?
And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman and brought her unto the man.
Solomon?
He's not here.
His bed is empty.
I'll go look for him.
God in heaven.
Don't we have a medical examiner for that?
Three counties sharing one ME, we tend not to be a priority.
After last night's rain, there isn't much left, but we take the pictures, send it all up to Harrisburg for forensic analysis.
I don't need Harrisburg to tell me she got her skull caved in.
Hey, that's the girl's family over there.
Whoever did this might have done the same thing to him.
All right, Mr. Bowman, I assure you every effort will be made.
My son had no dealings with Indian girls.
- So where is the boy?
Both of you just back off now!
I tell you he did not kill anyone.
Came out bigger and meaner than when he went in.
- You guys bust him?
- No, staties got him.
Me and Brock tried to arrest him a while back.
- You tried?
- He's a large man.
That's very good.
Excuse me.
State troopers are helping with the search, but there's nothing yet.
- Do you have any idea where he might be?
- Solomon's not a killer.
There's a lot of people who believe he is.
That's why we need to find him before the Kinaho do.
If I can be of any help, Sheriff, any help at all.
Lana Cleary had an ex-boyfriend, a guy named Tommy Littlestone.
In fact, none of the Redbones date outside the tribe.
So my guess is if his little brother's girl was involved with some Amish boy, that wouldn't have gone over so well.
I guess we need to have a little chat with Tommy Littlestone.
We have no jurisdiction on the reservation.
- We don't have jurisdiction here, all right?
We should probably have a talk with him.
He's gonna poke around.
We can see who you are, man.
- Look, we just want to ask you a few questions.
Look, son, I don't want to argue the finer points of the law with you, but we are investigating a potential capital murder case.
Fucking cops.
- You're Chayton Littlestone.
You got no business being on the rez, cop.
Well, that's something we can talk about.
Far as I'm concerned, you have no authority on or off the reservation.
You see, all the land around here was Kinaho land before the white man ever sailed.
And then your forefathers stole it, parceled it up and sold it as if they were entitled.
Just like you feel entitled to walk into my house because you wear that piece of polished tin.
And now a red girl has been killed on white man's land that should have rightfully belonged to her people to begin with and you... you don't see the audacity it takes for you to turn up here pointing fingers?
I'm trying to find out who killed that girl.
You won't find that here.
If you didn't kill her, then you got nothing to worry about.
Do I look worried?
Well, that's something you don't see every day.
Everything all right in here?
Okay, which one of you assholes is Tommy Littlestone?
Guess your brother ate all the vitamins, huh?
Thanks for saving my ass back there.
Guy was about five seconds away from tearing me apart.
Well, we can't have that.
Not when things are just getting interesting.
The sheriff is busy right now, but who can I tell him is here?
Jason.
I'll let the sheriff know that you're here.
I could put you away for 10 years on those alone.
You came onto the rez without a federal warrant.
These arrests are illegal.
Yeah, see, you guys all say this to me like I should give a shit.
If you give a shit about the dead girl, seems to me you should be looking for the Amish kid.
So you got nothing to tell me about Lana and Tommy?
I'll see you again, cop, outside this cage.
Ever the optimist.
It means it's my job to tell you that you had no authority to go into Kinaho land and start shaking people down.
You get straight to the point, huh?
Well, when I asked him if he killed the girl, the big one tried to kill me.
Well, that's not exactly conclusive now, is it?
They have priority, so I'm having him transferred back to their jurisdiction.
Believe me, they're welcome to him.
My boss doesn't like you.
I don't know who you are, but you're not Lucas Hood.
What do you want?
Well, for starters, where's my father?
Your father is dead.
You don't seem too worried about that.
Yeah, I had a father like that, too.
So what's stopping me from just walking out that door right now and blowing your shit out of the water?
If you really think I'm the guy who killed your father, a cop, in cold blood, then had the balls to steal his identity, do you really think it's a smart idea to sit there and threaten me?
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
I'm fucking starving.
I'll talk to her.
Hello, Miriam.
You allowed the elders to send your only daughter away with nowhere to go.
As I think you knew I would be, right?
And now... could it really be that you'd just rather hang your laundry and leave your son to die than speak to me, the only person who might be able to help?
We want the boy.
You can and you will.
Is it true about Solomon and the Indian girl?
You're all brave men intimidating people you know won't fight back.
I'll give you 30 seconds to get back into your trucks and go.
No, what I'm thinking is I'm gonna take this bat and shove it up your bitch ass and see how you like that.
You dare speak to me like this?
As if I would do such a thing.
Your insolence is beyond contempt.
Mother.
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness though we have sinned against him.
This is about the life of your grandchild.
If Kai can help, I will not be the one to stop him.
Well, I was working for these guys out in Portland.
- What kind of guys?
- Pretty much what you think.
You know, bad guys, bad-tempered, bad drugs.
Things got uncool and I decided it was time to split.
And they sent some asshole after me back in Nevada.
- You boys need anything more?
- You got any pie?
Look around you, son.
Does this look like the kind of place that serves pie?
- Do you know how to do all that?
- I know a guy.
I'm thinking of just... disappearing.
You know, like going up to Canada and maybe get work with the fishing fleets.
Yeah, I can help you out.
But it's gonna take a few days.
You're gonna check in to the Valley Motel and you're gonna stay there.
I don't want to see your face around town.
Hey, where you going?
In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a little busy.
He just leave me with the check?
Ah, I'm fucking bleeding.
Pay attention.
And the man who just walked out this door, he killed the men who did it.
Now, you may find this hard to believe, given his winning personality, but the man actually has friends here.
Good friends, if you take my meaning.
I know because I'm one of them.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.
Let me get you a band-aid.
You okay?
- Rebecca, what happened?
What happened?
Brock has got the staties combing the woods for Solomon.
You've got to give it a rest.
- I'm gonna drive you home, okay?
I'm gonna make you something.
- You want some more?
With everything that's happened in the last couple of days, you know what's sticking with me?
Lana's mother told me her girl was gonna be a schoolteacher.
I wanted to do that once.
A long time ago.
How's your head?
Fine.
I should probably go.
You should go.
Previously on Californication:
I need to present myself to Karen as an adult male with a job.
- You must be Hank.
- Henry James Moody the First.
The last thing I need is some snotty, pretentious fuck who looks down on television.
- I'm trying to grow up before it's too fucking late, and it all starts with me getting a job.
Are you sure you can handle a job?
Hey, did you manage to get it up last night?
When did this occur?
I guess about nine months before I was born.
I thought it was very rock 'n' roll.
Totally, and yet it sends a very strong and clear message to my co-workers that this dude could rock out with his cock out but when he's done, he can tuck it away and get down to biz.
My thoughts exactly.
If I'd known it was this easy to make your bosom swell with pride I would've applied for a job at Starbucks long ago.
You're finally ready to embrace change, I think.
Well, the times, they are a-changing whether I likes it or not.
I know, you're a heroin addict.
You have terminal hemorrhoids, right?
- Nothing?
- Nope, not a twitch.
I even tossed his salad for a second or three.
Kid lives for fucking ass play.
It felt wrong, like I was blowing a baby.
A big, bald, unemployable baby.
Look at the four of us.
Ain't love fucking grand, huh?
- How'd she take it?
- I was about to lay it on her when you sulked into the room with all your broken-wiener sadness.
Jesus, it sounds uncool when I say it out loud like that.
Someone to carry on the Moody-ness for generations to come.
Kid's kind of annoying.
I mean, super fucking annoying, like he should be your son and not mine.
He shall be Levon, and I shall decline that shit.
So, who's the mom?
This woman, Julia, I was seeing at the time.
By the way, what are you doing here?
I wanted to make sure you showed up for work you know, on time, reasonably sober.
You're pulling in a weekly salary now.
Fifteen percent of your weekly is my weekly.
- Think about getting some other clients.
Whoa, that's a powerful grip you got there.
- There's some in the kitchen.
Right on.
There's some in the kitchen.
Fuck you and your fucking cupcakes, Hugh.
Get a fucking life.
So, Terry, tell me a bit about yourself.
I'm in a long-term relationship and these are my kids.
Yeah, well, we don't actually know that for sure.
- Calling me a liar?
- No, not technically.
You're a real fucking asshole, you know?
- Now you sound like my kid.
- Cool, where you working at?
- A television show.
- Cool, which one?
- Santa Monica Cop.
- Is that like Beverly Hills Cop?
No, I barely have a job here.
- Cool, you wanna come over?
Right, because she's your mom.
No, no, I don't, which is a source of great sadness for me.
Sure, I suppose, if you want to be all queer about it.
You have a roommate?
Levon, did you take my toothpaste again?
- What the fuck?
- I couldn't have said it any better myself.
Mom, Dad, don't be mad.
If it's any consolation, I was just commenting to the boy that you still got it, you know, you're still smoking hot.
- Obviously.
- You could've mentioned that?
Does she know that you made contact?
Coming, Mom.
This is just a lot to process right now.
I mean, all I have is his word to go on and no offense, but he doesn't present as the most trustworthy source.
- I'm still standing here.
Catch you on the flippity-flop.
That's a good-Iooking sammie you got, Hank.
And it hasn't been in the vicinity of any shellfish?
I watched them cook it just like you asked.
- That would be a shame.
Why are you taking a picture of it?
It's a beautiful burger.
How about I bring a starving African kid in here have him watch you take a picture of your gourmet burger with your fucking iPhone?
Ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Maybe you should spend a little less time sexualizing your lunch and a little more time coming up with a workable fucking story idea.
I do read them, you know, when I'm in the mood for a raging hate boner.
Hank, this is what we do in here.
Those 20 years' child support, you don't want to pay that.
Okay, people, how do we use this on the show?
I shouldn't have to share an office with a convicted rapist.
Despite all his rage, he is still just a cock in a cage.
- You think rape is funny?
Rath, are you just gonna sit here and let this happen?
- Please, continue.
- Goldie, are you okay?
- My mom just got me this shit, Goldie.
God, I would love a nice wine cooler right now, or like a microbrew.
An Allagash White would totally hit the fucking spot, right?
How come you never told me?
This is what I remember.
We were running around the city for a few months hanging out, having fun, keeping it simple and then one day the phone stopped ringing.
I remember not being all that offended, because we were never really together.
So when I realized I was knocked up, it seemed pretty pointless to tell you.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.
You're fun, kind of like driving around in a car with a dog who sticks his head out the window.
- What kind of dog?
No, not technically.
How long have you been here?
- Can we get back to your story?
Nowhere.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He's got all these crazy expectations of you guys making up for lost time.
I don't have the heart to tell him you're not that kind of guy.
How do you know what kind of guy I am now?
Look, I'm giving you a gift here.
I'm telling you it's okay to walk away.
I'm asking you nicely to just do the right thing and leave us the fuck alone.
Drink's on me.
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, Stu used to pop them all the time.
We used to fuck for hours.
His cock was like a battering ram.
It was like it was made of liquid metal.
It was the T-1000 of boners.
Okay, Marcy, I don't know how many times I can say this but your fond remembrance of your ex-husband's horse cock does not work wonders for my fragile psyche.
- Hank, it's your first day.
- It's a long story.
That's what the extra 5 percent is for.
Good luck with that.
Hank, Hank, thank God you're here.
Because I think she's afraid she'll lose me if I develop a relationship with you.
Maybe she's just afraid that I'll disappoint you.
But I did my research, and when we moved out here I knew that was my opportunity to come find you.
You know, your mom has done a pretty good job all by herself.
I don't even know how to relate to other guys.
I'm sure I scared them away.
I don't even know how to deal with girls.
Thought maybe some of your cool would rub off on me or something.
Probably, but aren't we all?
Does he want a job?
Because I just promoted the PA to writers' assistant.
He wanted a reward for cleaning up all that puke.
Kids today, they're so fucking entitled.
Hey, hey, I remember this show.
- Oh, yeah, you like that one?
- I created that show.
- Oh, sorry, I...
Hank, thank God you're alive.
Will you get a load of that?
I think I'm getting hard.
Behave yourself, you animal.
I'm feeling very dizzy, Hank.
God, you smell good.
Holy shit, did he just come in his pants?
Quit stalking me, lady.
- Levon told me where you lived.
- Of course he did.
This is uncharted territory for both of us.
Not really.
It's more like I callus myself in the pursuit of happiness.
Play something.
- I'm too shy, actually.
- I don't remember you being shy.
Oh, baby, was it that bad?
What are you doing?
Mrs. Peterson?
We trained together and served together and, well, we came to be good friends.
Would you like to come inside?
So, are you sure I can't get you anything?
Maybe just some water would be nice.
How did you get here?
When did you get out?
Well, I was discharged on Wednesday and I came straight here from Fort Kennilworth.
Why?
I said I'd do that and so, here I am.
Would you excuse me, please?
That's me.
Right there.
It wasn't my intention to upset you, ma'am.
You knew Caleb?
Well, I noticed a motel off the highway on the way here...
We insist.
Well, I've got to head to the diner.
Can I show you to your room?
Mrs. Peterson, are you sure you're comfortable with me staying in here?
Of course.
I mean, it's not like it's going to any use.
I think it could be a good thing for us.
So, you knew my brother?
I did, pretty well, yeah.
Wow, that is...
Yeah, yeah, I got hit with a football in gym class.
Oh, no, thank you, Mrs. Peterson, I'm fine.
So, that friend of your brother's, is he sticking around?
Why don't you like him?
I've got to go.
Not really.
So, you're kind of smart?
I guess so.
Hey, how was work?
David, sure I can't get you a beer?
You can have all the beer you want then, assuming you buy it yourself.
Are you helping him with his homework?
Well, not exactly.
But Allan, his name's Allan, he's only been there for, what, like, four years, but he's got a degree, so, boom, suddenly he's regional manager and I'm not.
Let's have a couple more of these to celebrate, and then I've got to get off to bed.
God, you can put your liquor away.
I guess so.
What are you doing here?
Don't you, like, have any friends?
I have lots of friends.
What are you waiting for?
I want you to show me who hit you yesterday.
What are you going to do?
Nothing bad.
Over there.
All of them?
What are you doing?
They're going to a bar?
Yeah, this place will serve you if you're on the football team.
No.
Well, I'll be inside if you change your mind.
Hey, Luke.
Maybe it's his boyfriend or something?
Excuse me.
I'm gonna need to see some ID.
You ID all of them?
What can I get you?
Do you know how to make a fireball?
Cinnamon schnapps and Tabasco sauce.
Do you wanna buy anything for their fellas?
Do I look like I'd like to buy something for their fellas?
Might be the polite thing to do.
Sure, okay, fine.
I'm gonna get each one of those guys a cosmopolitan.
Are you, like, rich?
God!
You get used to it.
Thanks for the drink.
For the damages.
Is he all right?
Well, I am very relieved that you were there.
I'm going to get ready for Kristen's.
Excuse us.
Invite him to the party.
David, would you like to come to the party with me tonight?
Luke, I need to take a shower.
Yeah, well, neither do my parents.
Where are they?
Anna?
Well, you can set them right here.
My man, welcome to the party.
Craig, no.
Sure.
Thanks.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, I need to talk to you.
I'm busy right now, Drew.
I've been calling you all week, and then I hear you're having a party tonight?
Motherfucker!
Get him out of here.
Sorry about your picture.
Are you okay?
Hey, there they are.
- Want some?
- No, I'm good.
Support us how?
I mean, you know, we support you, like, "Go America!" right?
Hey, man, I mean, I just...
What?
I'm just fucking with you, man.
I'll be right back.
Nice piece of ass there?
Soldiers like guns.
- You ready to go?
- I'll drive.
- No, I'm fine.
And how are you more sober than me?
I'm bigger than you.
Please, put on your seat belt.
Thank you.
I like this music.
It's, just a mix that I made.
Can you put this song on it?
Yeah, I can do that.
So, good night.
Good night.
Thanks for inviting me out.
Yeah, his name is David Andersen Collins.
I can tell you the unit that he served in if that helps.
No, nothing's wrong.
He was friends with my brother and we heard that he was back, so, any contact information would be great.
Tell Fort Kennilworth that David Collins is dead.
Next week I'm meeting with the rest of the board to discuss the future of our work with the military, in light of Project Aegolius' dissolution.
My apologies, but you'll have to excuse me.
When did Fort Kennilworth receive this call?
About an hour ago, sir.
Have you ID'd the caller?
Not confirmed, but she gave her name as Anna Peterson.
If anyone asks what's happening, what do I tell them?
Make something up.
No one outside this circle can know that any of our subjects are still active.
Call me when you got the plane booked.
I'm not late, am I?
Good.
Let's get started.
You army?
Yes, sir.
I'm navy, myself.
Yeah, that's fine.
You want the Elite?
That's what I was thinking.
Hey, what the fuck, David?
Yeah, thanks for calling me back.
What?
Hey, Mom, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure, sweetie, what's going on?
Spencer?
They'd both taken a bunch of prescription pills, it was like they committed suicide together or something.
I just don't get it.
Who'd want to hurt Craig?
So, how does this work again?
First you make a hole at the top, so you can reach in and scoop all the guts out.
Do you carry that with you, like, all the time?
Oh, this thing?
Why?
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too.
Do you want some advice, Luke?
Sure.
Then bring a knife to school.
You're giving this to me?
That's cool.
Shit.
Hello.
Hey, it's, me.
What?
They found the gun that killed Craig in your van?
But you're innocent!
I love you, all right?
I'm 20 years old, I can date who I want.
Right.
What about him?
Everybody's best friend.
I called the military base that he said he was from and they told me he was dead.
Anna Peterson, you owe him an apology right now.
I probably should have explained the, special forces thing earlier, it's just, we're not really supposed to talk about it.
Yes, please.
Is it done?
Yeah.
Well, thank you.
Good luck.
Get any information you can on this guy.
Hey, what's that you're looking at?
Are you looking for someone to do your sex change operation?
You little fucking bitch...
That's right, bitches.
God damn it.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
What happened?
This kid called me a faggot, so I, broke a yardstick on his face.
That's pending the decision of the board, but I'm afraid it's fairly certain.
What did the kid call him?
What?
And I'd like to know how many others have been perpetrated against her son under your watch.
I'll be interested to see what the board makes of you when this is in front of the entire country, not to mention our lawyers.
I didn't even know he was gay.
What about after-school detention?
That seems fair.
We'll agree to that.
I'm a friend of the family.
Do you think I killed Craig?
I don't care.
Yeah, I mean, why would I need a plastic surgeon, right?
That's an interesting theory.
Did Anna tell anyone else about this?
Thank you.
I'll go get the rest.
Thank you, David.
You wouldn't happen to have seen anyone resembling this man, would you?
Ma'am, when was the last time you saw him.
Well, he just went inside.
Get him!
Who are those men?
It would take too long to explain.
What are you talking about?
David, why are those men trying to kill you?
It doesn't matter.
He's here in the...
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry about this, sir.
I think he's dead.
- Yes, but...
Excuse me, are you Anna Peterson?
Yes.
Is everything all right?
Where was she going?
What?
What?
We're going to the rec center to get your brother.
Who are you?
The soldier you know as David was one of the subjects of a medical experiment.
Maybe you shouldn't have tested your procedures on a psychopath.
By all accounts, he was an ideal soldier.
Mr. Peterson, is that a cell phone?
Didn't I say, "Phones off"?
Hand it over.
You can have it back after detention.
Where are those cop cars going?
Somebody attacked your diner right after we left it.
It was called in as an explosion.
Is anyone alive?
I don't know.
You haven't said anything about my parents.
They're both dead.
He killed them before we could stop him.
David has neurological conditioning, Miss Peterson, designed to protect both him and the experiment.
If he feels like his identity may be compromised, he's programmed to clean up all loose ends.
I doubt he could stop himself now even if he wanted to.
It's why we need to get you and your brother somewhere safe.
Miss Peterson, we need to go.
Miss Peterson?
Yeah, let's go get my brother.
What the hell is this?
For the fall dance, they do this Halloween maze thing.
Stay close to me.
How do I get through this maze?
Left, right, right, left, left, right, left, then straight.
Who are you exactly?
What's going on?
Just this way.
Hello, sir.
You shouldn't have followed me.
Mom and Dad are...
I'm going to come back for you.
I'm really sorry about this, guys.
I tried to think of another way to do it.
Any other solution.
Come on out, buddy.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You killed my parents.
I did.
Hey, Luke.
You did the right thing.
I don't blame you.
Don't feel bad.
Thank you.
Follow the light.
You both feeling okay?
We're fine.
What's the deal?
What the fuck!
Previously on Penny Dreadful...
Father!
Mina!
We'll find her again.
At least you know she's alive.
Is that what you call it?
Do what you have promised me.
You will make me an immortal mate.
My bride must be beautiful.
Something or someone has triggered it.
You're now in a very special place.
I know he doesn't want her to die, but I'm not quite sure why he wants her to live.
That's the problem.
I believe Mina is trying to be found.
We know they flee when they're discovered, like a pack of rats seeking a new den.
Perhaps this time we'll be lucky.
And if we are?
I left my son to suffer without me.
I'll not do the same to my daughter.
Meaning?
If I can save her, I will.
And will that bring you peace?
I'll contact the others.
We'll go after the theater closes tonight.
There is a gentleman here to see you.
Show Mr. Gray in.
Mr. Gray, hello.
Won't you sit down?
I'm so glad to see you've recovered.
I stopped by, but they told me you were ill.
I went traveling, you know, since I couldn't see you.
Welcome back.
Will you read my future?
I don't know that you have one.
Everyone has a future.
Not everyone.
Some people only have a past.
Then read my past.
Then you would have no more mystery.
Sembene can show you out.
We ought to just take him.
Not here.
Enjoy the hunt.
This winter never ends in this fucking country.
If you'll come this way, sir.
It's a prototype, acquired by something less than our usual standards of professional etiquette.
It has something new.
Automatic firing mechanism.
7.63 by 25 millimeter cartridges.
Highest velocity pistol shells in the world.
Stop an elephant.
I'll take it.
Who doesn't?
Are you interested in firearms?
My late husband was.
I suppose I'm sentimental about the smell of gun oil.
And a woman alone in a city needs protection, doesn't she?
Oh, Evelyn, please.
You're planning another expedition, I read.
Matter of a year, perhaps two.
A friend of my daughter.
Who do you see much of?
Tired old explorers like myself.
Well, I must run.
This has been a pleasure, Evelyn.
Not so memorable as our first encounter.
I wouldn't say that.
Good day.
Die, die, die.
Line, line, line.
Watch your marks here, darling.
Now comes the moment when we shall tell.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Get me down.
Just bring him down.
Sorry, Vincent.
Look, would you get me out of this thing?
Mr. Gregor, please!
I'm not going up until you get this sorted.
When you get your monster to behave, we'll be back.
Maud, come.
I'm sorry, Vincent.
No, pet.
I brought you an orange.
Thank you.
Everyone likes oranges, I reckon.
Thank you.
Reading again?
Thank you for the book.
Paradise Lost.
That was sweet.
Are you reading it?
Well, it's awfully long.
You've read it?
I'm sorry about Simon today.
He's a beast sometimes, but he doesn't really mean it.
Yes, he does.
He makes you happy?
In a way.
I believe that lot is for others.
What a sad thing to say.
You don't have to hide your face from me.
I'll see you later, then.
You have not been honest with me.
What do you want, Vanessa?
Why did you not want me on the ship?
I was trying to protect you.
I don't believe you.
Believe what you like.
What haven't you told me?
Nothing I would say would come as a surprise.
So you simply want the satisfaction of hearing me say it.
Very well.
I would sacrifice you to save my daughter.
Your connection to Mina is my lifeline, so I must keep you alive.
I put the photograph in the drawer because I couldn't bear it.
It broke my heart.
Neither of us is free from guilt.
Yes, but you want to be.
That's the difference between us.
What have you done to yourself?
You really shouldn't come in here.
Simon comes in here.
I'm sorry for this.
Ridiculous theatricals, are we not?
Nothing to be done.
We are mortals all, extravagant in our weakness.
Given half a chance, I'd keep you and sack her, but the public demands the ingenue.
Thank you for your kindness, Vincent.
I've not known much of it.
Remember us better than we are.
Mr. Gray.
Thank you for coming, Miss Ives.
May I call you Vanessa?
Of course.
Another 15 years, and it will flower again.
A lifetime.
An instant.
Will you walk with me?
Do you feel I owe you an explanation?
You owe me nothing but your company this afternoon.
Yes, that's your way.
The pleasant neutrality that risks nothing.
Between us there's a rare connection, I won't deny it.
But that very intimacy released something... unhealthy in me, something I cannot allow.
I don't know what I'm feeling.
It's rejection.
Goodbye, Mr. Gray.
Well, you can't stay here.
I've no intention to.
Then why did you come?
Because I've nowhere else.
No, I have no one else.
Is that not the saddest of all, creator?
I'm again cast on your barren shores.
And a futile thing, too.
Futile.
All futile.
But how could that happen?
For the monster is not in my face, but in my soul.
I once thought that if I was like other men, I would be happy and loved.
The malignance has grown, you see, from the outside in.
And this shattered visage merely reflects the abomination that is my heart.
I would rather be the corpse I was than the man I am.
Go ahead.
Pull the trigger.
It would be a blessing.
Stay here.
I need you.
I can give you a sedative.
It would ease things.
And your spirit?
My soul?
If you like.
I hated that fucker God, you see?
That is all.
Aye, but to where?
I've not been good.
Who waits for me on the other side of the door?
It won't be long.
Could you go to the end of the corridor and fetch me a basin of fresh water?
I'll be right back.
I believe in a place between heaven and hell, between the living and the dead.
A glorious place of everlasting rebirth, perhaps even salvation.
Do you believe in such a place?
I know that you'll pay it easily.
Her passing was a thing of grace, I promise you.
Spend your time with her.
This goddamn country, right?
What I wouldn't give for an ice chip.
You miss the cherry phosphates, Ethan?
No actual first name, so far as I know.
Of course, he was raised Chiricahua Apache before the Carlisle School Americanized him, made him the proper Christian gent you see before you.
What do you want?
Your father's eager to see you.
Don't you miss your daddy?
Whole mess.
Show him, Mr. Kidd.
I'll even let you win.
Give us any vexation, and we'll drag you back like a monkey.
Your daddy says, "Come home," so home you come.
You can't run forever, Ethan.
I do miss the ice chips.
You won't be needing those, Mr. Kidd.
We have underestimated our prey, Mr. Kidd.
I don't take tobacco.
Neither do I.
I was so very sorry to hear about Ms. Croft.
Thank you for your kindness when I was ill.
Was it kindness, I wonder.
Let's say it was.
If Mina's inside, we shall seize our moment, but under no circumstances are you to approach her.
She is my responsibility.
Father.
You've brought her to me.
You've done well.
Mina, I can save you.
Somewhere inside, you know who you are.
And now that he has his bride, he'll sire generations.
Don't do this.
I'm your daughter.
I already have a daughter.
You were right.
I was never going to go to Africa.
This room will seem empty without my gear.
We should get a Christmas tree, should we not?
We can have the boys come over to decorate.
Good to see you again, pal.
You ought to just come along now.
The fun's over.
You think so?
No monkey.
What do you fear, girl?
Are they really so monstrous?
Do you believe a soul can be taken over by another?
That you can lose yourself to something dark?
Do you?
I believe more in sicknesses that can be treated.
You mean exorcism?
You know, back in Wales, where I'm from, there was a boy who was ill.
It was, uh, well, a community event, you might say.
He died.
They all died.
No one did.
Before we continue our conversation, my dear, there is one thing you must understand.
Even if it can be verified, this is a long, grueling and dangerous thing you ask.
It could take months, or years, or always, or never.
If you have been touched by the demon, it's like being touched by the back hand of God.
Makes you sacred in a way, doesn't it?
Now, here's my question.
Do you really want to be normal?
Previously on "The originals"
I need to consecrate the remains of a powerful witch.
All our power will drain away.
Every girl who died released her power onto the next.
That's cool.
These drawings, what are they?
She called them evil.
The italians call them strega.
The Yoruba of west Africa call them aje, meaning mother.
Where my mother as from, they called them hexa, and here we call them witch.
Over the centuries, vampires have fought them and fought beside them, bedded them and burned them.
Whether adversary or ally, and they have been a force to be reckoned with.
Their ancestral magic anchors this city.
There's never been one all-powerful witch until Davina.
Who is now tucked in safe and sound down the hall under my protection.
Why does any witch do anything?
Go away!
You haven't eaten since-- since your best friend killed my best friend?
Davina, I'm sorry about what happened to this kid Tim.
I'm sorry you don't hate Klaus for what he did or want to make him pay.
He'll pay for what he did one way or the other, but right now, I just want to make peace with you.
Well, that's going well.
Young, old, dead, or alive, witches are a pain in the ass.
What's with all the racket?
Bloody hell.
There's something you need to know.
What the hell is going on?
I said disrupt the household, not destroy the whole city.
This is madness.
How can a 16-year-old girl shake the entire French quarter?
I seen her rock the church, but I've never seen anything like this.
How did you control her when she was in the attic?
The point is in her present state she's useless as a tool against the witches.
But why is it manifesting itself in such an aggressive manner?
Where are you going?
You're going to see Sophie.
You don't have to eavesdrop.
I keep nothing from you.
Well, I don't want to keep anything from you either, and if you're going out to see Sophie, then there's something that you should know.
She called me and asked me for a favor.
She promised me that she would help break the curse that Marcel put on my people in exchange for some information.
And I didn't think anything of it, but then Davina started doing those pictures of Celeste--
Whatever this is, you have to tell me.
Sophie wanted to find Celeste's remains, so I... went through your journals, and I found out where you buried her, and then I told her.
She wanted to be left in peace.
When a witch's remains are consecrated, that power fuels the rest of their community.
Celeste did not want her remains to be found.
She made me promise to bury her where she would not be found.
I thought they were just bones, Elijah.
If you truly believed that, why didn't you ask me where to find her?
If that's dinner, I pass.
Sophie, where have you been?
Short answer-- grave robbing.
I figured out a way how to become one.
Soph, you can't just become an elder.
That power has to be bestowed upon you by the other elders, all of whom are dead.
Following my logic?
How about follow your history?
I did research.
In 1742, there was a witch massacre that wiped out all the elders, so they decided whoever consecrated the most powerful dead witch in the community became an elder.
It worked for them.
So how the hell did you find her?
That's not disrespectful.
Soph, I'm aware of our deadline, but--
And if we fail, the witches are done for in this town.
My niece will never come back.
I happen to care.
You're coming with me.
So you have stolen the remains of the very person that Davina's been drawing for months.
Would you care to explain this startling coincidence?
Was that Davina?
Charming little habit she's developed.
And the earthquake I felt today?
Also Davina, and she's taken to vomiting dirt.
I thought that we had more time, but we need to complete the harvest now.
One person was never meant to hold that much power.
It's tearing her apart, and it will take us down with it.
We need to prepare.
According to Sophie Deveraux, as Davina self-destructs, she'll cycle through 4 stages that represent the 4 elements that bound together the harvest.
Earth stage comes first.
The after the wind is water.
But I didn't take over this town to watch it burn to the ground.
You can stop this, right?
Yes, but you're not gonna like how.
They're liars!
I know what it's like to have your life stripped away from you because of other people's bad decisions.
How do you think I became a vampire?
So fix her.
She can't be fixed.
What--what is that?
The more upset you become, the faster you deteriorate.
I compelled up some sedative.
Convinced now?
We all agreed that Davina must be sacrificed.
There's no need to let her blow the roof off our heads in the meantime.
Marcel, no one wishes to see Davina come to harm less than I, but there is no scenario here in which we simply wait this out.
The harvest was working before it was stopped.
If a nonbeliever like Sophie Deveraux can come to have faith that these girls will be resurrected, then I, also, am a believer.
I saved Davina from the harvest, and now you want me to just hand her over?
Do you think that I'm happy about this?
The earthquake I was willing to chalk up to hideous coincidence, but these winds?
If Davina is not sacrificed, then every inch of earth that shook, everything blowing about now will soon be drenched in water and consumed by fire.
And we all saw it burnt to the ground twice.
Just on my way out.
Which one of us is the people person again?
Fat lot of good that will do.
You do realize you have to slit a girl's throat, a very sweet girl as it turns out.
If it means I get my niece Monique back, I can handle anything.
Why are you really here?
Enlighten me.
A witch at her full power can trade body blows with a vampire punch for punch.
After this, Marcel will still be here, and so will Klaus, and you know better than anyone that those two don't fight fair.
You are going to need an original on your side, and I'm gonna need a witch on mine if we're gonna stop those two from running things.
Am I missing something?
Why would you side with me?
Sometimes, what's more important is not who you're siding with but who you're siding against.
I'm done caring what Klaus says.
You don't have to be here for this.
It's gonna take some time for Sophie to prepare for her consecration.
Have you ever experienced something so... profound and wonderful that when it was taken from you your life felt unbearable?
Yes, I have felt that, and I've got the scars to prove it.
I believe that when you love someone and that person loves you in return you're uniquely vulnerable.
They have a power to hurt you that's like nothing else.
Who has?
Bloody, bloody Marcel!
And you wanted to run off and start a life with this back stabber.
Says the man who was shacking up with him not two seconds before all this went down.
He could have gone anywhere.
What are you doing?
I was gonna take these to the...
This is not the night to be out there.
For anyone.
But some people don't have a choice.
Right.
Grab that lot and come with me.
This isn't working.
I have no clue where she is.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I don't believe you!
You want to kill me just like everyone else.
You're the one who saved me?
Yeah, but now the witch who did the spell is in league with the rest of them, so I had to take you away.
So you could use me as a weapon?
I'm trying to keep you safe.
All this power that you have, it gave me an advantage.
It helped me punish the witches, and it let me run the city, and I let that mean too much.
All right, but that's over with now.
One survivor to another, all I want to do is keep you alive, I swear.
We still haven't gone through all that you've already provided, Klaus.
Well, this newest bit isn't from me.
That's very kind of you.
And these people are?
I asked Father Kieran to give them shelter.
He suffers from an incessant desire to do good.
I assume from the stupefied look on your face they haven't sought refuge in your attic.
These people, they're werewolves, and the priest, he said that you donated the food.
You're helping them?
They've fallen upon hard times, and their plight has brought out the philanthropist in me.
What can I say?
Must be Elijah's influence.
What do you mean your clan?
The blood that runs in their veins runs in mine.
And in our child's.
This family gets more complicated by the second.
He's accomplished in many things, but he is a master of forgiveness.
It didn't work.
I tried to consecrate her and absorb her magic, but there's nothing there.
I don't understand.
A witch's magic is infused in her bones until consecrated.
Well, then someone's already taken it because there's nothing there.
Has to be another way.
There is no other way.
There is someone else actually.
My mother.
It's taken 1,000 years, but you've finally gone mad.
Our own mother?
Yes, our beloved mother, who Niklaus has affectionately placed in a coffin in his basement, not daggered but quite dead.
Well, she did try to kill us all.
Well, I say we put her to use and put her to rest once and for all.
Now if we bury our mother on land owned by one of her descendents, she becomes a New Orleans witch, and we as her family share in that ancestral magic.
Only hitch is as conduits of Esther's magic, they need to participate in the harvest.
Hayley now holds the title to the plantation.
So if we bury our mother there and we consecrate those grounds, we can finish the harvest ritual.
Our mother was the most powerful witch in history.
If we bury her, we hand that power to our enemies to use against us.
I don't know why I bother.
You two will just do what you want anyway.
This is not a democracy.
Kill a demon today, face the devil tomorrow.
Count me in.
So much for your grand schemes of using Davina for revenge.
Survival first, plots to overthrow my brother second.
Where would Marcel hide something precious to him?
You think I'm just gonna offer that up so you can leave me here to rot?
Water runs downhill.
You think I have to have drowned before to know how much that will suck.
Just tell me where Marcel would go.
There's a place by the docks.
That sounds like a beautiful dream.
But it was just a dream.
Get out!
No one is asking you not to fight.
Did you find them?
Will he bring her?
He'll bring her.
Are you ready to do this?
Always and forever.
It's done.
I'll die whether I do this or not.
I mean, now the only option is-- is whether I take everyone with me.
If you look at it that way, it's kind of selfish not to do it.
Most people don't get that even if they live to be 100.
Marcel, I'm ready.
Fire.
Do you believe in the harvest?
I believe.
We call upon our elders to resurrect your chosen ones.
Resurrect your chosen ones.
That won't bring her back, you know?
This is your fault.
I should have never let you anywhere near her.
If you hadn't gotten her worked up, if you hadn't killed that boy!
She is dead!
Do you hear me?
I'm sorry.
You may think I know nothing of your grief, but you are wrong.
It was years before I could speak your name so keenly did I feel that loss.
I'm sorry.
Are you ready to forgive me yet?
It's not that easy, Hayley.
During my fever in the bayou, you were inside my mind.
You know what Celeste means to me.
In a thousand years, I have found it but twice, and when I have, I have honored it.
I know what a promise means to you, Elijah, but you made it 200 years ago.
I won't choose the dead over the living, so why are you?
I'm sorry, Elijah.
This whole thing was doomed from the start, you know?
Yes, we saved the city, and I'm not complaining about the witches losing their power, but this did not go down the way I thought it would.
How did you find them down at the docks?
You're not the only one with clever little spies in the quarter, Nik.
Sometimes I think I don't give you your due, little sister.
I knew Elijah's plan was mad, but I really thought it would work.
What about the power?
4 were supposed to rise, and none did.
Where did all that power go?
Why are we here?
Someone brought us forth.
Who?
I did.
Bastiana, I've had to endure people calling me "Sabine" for almost a year now.
I'd appreciate it if you'd call me by my real name--
Celeste.
No, I'm not doing anything.
I didn't know that you wanted that.
Sorry.
My partner and I are investigating the murders of Officer Reynolds and Detective Wilden.
I took pictures of some of the stories in Ali's journal before "A" got it.
I can't believe you followed me here.
Well, I missed, like, half the movie.
That dude that was sitting in front of us kept making sales calls.
Okay, I'm sorry.
And now we'll never hear from her again.
Uh, hello?
This is somebody's desk.
Move it!
Okay, people are still eating.
Hey, in Ali's story about her date with an older guy, are they talking about "novels and travel" or "shovels and gravel"?
Okay, well, the "mystery dude" we should be focusing on is Patterson.
No, James Patterson, the author.
This guy just gets the criminal mind.
Okay, first of all, when were you interested in anybody born before 1989?
Maybe we shouldn't refer to the dead girl as a "random."
Look, if we follow the trail of "A's" cover-up, it could lead us right back to "A."
Is Travis reading them to you?
Wait, so you stayed home to read a book instead of going to that chick-flick with Aria and Emily?
Well, I wasn't invited.
- Where is your dad anyway?
Hello there.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing in my house?
I was invited here.
Here?
Love your wallpaper, by the way.
What's up?
Can you come in for a sec?
What's the deal with Mona?
Uh, we met in a group at school.
And we have a lot of friends in common.
Fazelli retired.
There's a new counselor and he's actually cool.
Well, I'm not cool with you cozying up to someone who spent junior year torturing me.
She wasn't sent to Radley for spa treatments.
Our parents broke themselves up, Aria.
Maybe it's time you let go of that and stop judging.
- How am I...
Well, if you've forgiven dad, why can't you forgive the messenger?
Hey, sweetie.
Dad, it was working fine that night.
Then suddenly the GPS had, like, a stroke or something and the engine stopped.
Well, he said something probably triggered the anti-theft device and shut it down from a remote location.
I'll take my bike.
I'm not shaken up.
Emily, a car plowed into the living room, almost killing you and your ma.
And the fact that the police don't know who was driving...
It has nothing to do with the accident.
Well, something's not right.
You're not eating, you're acting jumpy.
It's called senior year, okay?
I'll get through it.
So what exactly was the problem?
Maybe I could pick up Malcolm early while you deal with the landlord.
As in Seattle?
I'm sorry, I didn't know that she was here.
How can she talk to you like that after everything that she's... flying off the handle isn't gonna help anything, Aria.
That's a keeper.
If you like that series, you should really check out some of the Swedish authors.
For some reason, they do meatballs and crime novels better than anyone else.
I hate their meatballs.
My job, it isn't easy.
But it is especially hard when you realize that you've turned innocent people into collateral damage during an investigation.
We're okay.
Good.
Look, if "A" did hack into your car, wouldn't he own up to it by now?
The sociopathic mind feeds on intricate patterns.
Every rock you turn over gets picked up and hurled at Alison.
Can you please bury the hatchet with her?
Em, I've been through this with my parents, okay?
It sucks and nobody wins.
Okay, stop.
- What're you up to?
- Excuse me?
Drop the cougar-crap and tell me why you're after a 10th grader.
Who's Jesse?
The new guidance counselor that's the best thing that's happened to this friggin' school since we got a coffee cart.
He sees through the bull and he has a gift of bringing together people who need each other.
Oh, so you're gonna tell me that Jesse made this little love-connection?
Mona, when it comes to me and my friends, you always have an agenda.
No, you and your friends are the ones with the agenda, Aria.
After I helped Hanna's mom get out of jail, I was burned off like a wart.
Right.
Well, I'm tired of being yoyo'ed, and I am hanging out with a different crowd now.
So suck it up, Aria.
And then if you're not too busy after school, maybe you could come by and give me your physics notes.
Yes, I did.
Thank you.
Last two pages, huh?
I'm impressed.
Oh, well, I always read the endings first.
All right, go back.
Well, so far, all I'm missing is a reindeer sighting and a canoe trip down a fjord.
You were close.
All right, so what's the twist?
No way, uh-uh.
The ones they used to I.D. the body?
It always comes down to teeth, doesn't it?
No, I was just dropping by to...
What's your name?
I was just a little curious about Mike's group.
Can anyone join or did you handpick the students yourself?
It's open to everyone.
Well, it's just... my little brother has, um... he's befriended this certain individual who's bad news.
You're referring to Mona.
So how can I help you?
Look, how do I say this without sounding rude?
And I would really, really appreciate it if you didn't encourage them being together.
I'm not angry!
I'm just concerned.
And this individual's history supports it.
Well, I don't discourage friendships.
If two students bond, it's because they've found common ground.
Any time.
Yes, well, it's been an eventful couple of months for Emily.
Honestly, I think it's something more than that.
And Emily stayed and slept in her dead friend's bedroom, and I think it took a toll on her.
Yes, well, I imagine it would.
I think she really trusts you.
And, well, I'm wondering if you might be able to help get her back on track.
I think that might do her a world of good.
Well, I'm happy to be here for her.
I do appreciate it.
So one misconception is that a net force is required to keep a body in motion, when in fact it's needed to change whatever current state of motion the body is in.
Did you get that?
Uh, yeah, I think I did.
Jumping, dressage...
I don't know, like, seven.
So you're gonna need to know a lot about Newton for this.
You didn't?
You're the Captain of the decathlon team, you're a starting forward, and summa cum laude.
I need to stay up for a while.
I don't have any of that.
Plus, once I showed you my side boob.
Why'd you come here then?
I don't know.
I thought maybe you were done with that carpenter.
Dad?
so what do you think about my stories?
Grow up?
"I didn't say that."
I just think all great literature boils down to two themes:
"Love and death."
Who eats boysenberry pie with beer?
"Don't knock it till you try it."
I should write a story about you.
Maybe I'll write one about this moment... right now.
You're lucky my mom finished her box of Chardonnay.
Spencer, do you know what time it is?
No, I never went to bed.
You're gonna pass up finding the person who's after Ali to get your plaque scraped?
The police used dental records to prove that body was Alison's, and we know it wasn't.
So you think that "A" went in there as a patient?
Should we update Aria and Emily about any of this?
No, Emily will lose it if she thinks that we're hunting down clues again.
I don't think I can make her any angrier than she already is.
Just as long as it takes me to mail this.
So coming up here without him was a really nasty thing to do.
No, there is no excuse for someone to lie about something like that and screw up someone's life.
He's lucky to have a student who's so protective of him.
I'm guessing that you've done some lying yourself when it comes to Mr. Fitz.
Yeah, but it's not the kind that includes blackmailing his family into paying for a three bedroom house and a fancy summer camp.
Well, that's rich, coming from a kid who maintains her grade point average by sleeping with her teacher.
Just leave it.
I basically just made things worse for Ezra.
She'll make sure that he never sees Malcolm ever again.
Aria, you were acting as his friend, okay?
My dad drafted me to co-direct the spring play with him.
Because you won't drive your car?
Because I tried to stab him with scissors.
I gotta go.
Sean's coming home from boarding school soon.
Looks like I missed out.
You have a loose filling in number 29.
Boysenberry.
Or actually it might be BlackBerry.
Yeah, I am.
Yeah, so I've heard.
Hey, it's me.
I was just wondering if Maggie had called.
Look, I didn't mean to go off on her like that.
She's probably already called her lawyer and told her that you're involved with some violent psychotic freak.
I don't know what came over me.
I think I'm just so angry and... just call me when you can.
Dr. Ackard, it looks like Hanna Marin couldn't wait.
So I'll call her tomorrow to schedule a follow-up.
Been at it for a while over there, huh?
Yeah, it's a history paper, so there's a lot of reading.
I wanted to ask you, have you given any more thought to joining our group?
Look, Jesse, I'm not totally clueless.
I know that there's some things that I need to work through.
Thank you.
I hope he's not mad at me for...
What's this?
He already paid for it, so I figured why not?
But if anyone asks, I checked your I.D.
So what do you think about my stories?
No, I never said that.
I just think that all great literature boils down to two themes:
Love and death.
Who eats boysenberry pie with beer?
Do not knock it until you try it.
I should write a story about you.
Mr. Fitz?
Mr. Fitz, is that you?
Dad?
Mr. Fitz isn't here, and I don't want to be here by myself because... anyway, as soon as you get this message, please come to the school and pick me up immediately.
Dad, you have to get me out!
There's somebody in here!
Dad!
Should we call mom back?
Emily, it's gonna be okay, all right?
- This is all my fault.
I don't know how much more I can take of this.
Princess, I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry about me.
Emily, I didn't just come home to check up on you and your mom.
What's wrong?
It's my heart.
Because I ain't going anywhere.
You should take me back.
Your dad's in great hands and your mom's with him.
Please don't send me away.
Where have you been?
And I stole those appointment pages from that September...
One of you just please look inside my mouth.
Aria, give me the tweezers.
What is that?
I have no idea.
That was in my mouth?
What does that say?
I can't read it.
Hey, Board Shorts.
Miss me?
It looks like you haven't been sleeping.
How many goldstick variations are there?
Aria still isn't answering.
You take that side of the desk, you take the file cabinet.
Tell me that's what it loo like?
Ali's journal.
So that was Ezra at the cabin?
What is Mona doing here?
I don't know.
Is she looking for the book?
Why is Mona stealing papers from Mr. Fitz?
Shouldn't we do this in your room?
My parents are out of town, being lawyers.
I don't think there are any pages missing.
Okay, are you, like, getting a cold?
Allergies.
What do we know about Shana?
She was with Paige.
Not those kind of details.
I mean, did Shana ever mention anything about Georgia, something that connects with where Ali's hiding?
I thought you didn't want us looking for Ali.
I think "A" changed the rules on that.
Did it ever occur to you guys that we found that book awfully easy?
What are you thinking?
Em, get real, this is all about the a-ness of things.
Yeah, I wouldn not have said like that, but Hanna's right.
I love when you say that.
What are you thinking?
You don't want to know.
Try me.
I'm thinking it's Sunday night and I still have a lot of homework to do.
Creative writing homework?
Okay, you're gonna like this one when I'm done.
It started out as this one thing, and then it just turned into something completely different.
Does your villain lose in the end?
Sometimes the villain wins.
Sometimes.
"Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean."
You've been holding out on me.
I don't know what you mean.
You know exactly what I mean.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Trust you?
You're spread so thin, I can see right through you.
There's nothing wrong with me.
They help me focus.
I can pay for my own coffee.
For what?
Yeah, well, sometimes I have trouble taking constructive criticism.
I perceive it as a threat.
I'm the same way.
Have you been back to the hart and huntsman?
No, not since I saw you there.
Well, let me know what's good for you.
I will.
Cross your heart and hope to die?
The more I see of men, the more I want to get a dog.
Too bad there isn't another alternative.
Too bad.
So he just paid for your cup of coffee?
Left a ten-cent tip.
I rest my case.
What do we do?
You're President of the man-haters club, how would you feel about keeping an eye on Ezra Fitz?
I was born for the job.
Oh, it was fine.
Did you make it down to the Erie Canal Museum?
Ah, it was closed.
Too bad.
So, what did I miss around here?
Nothing much.
Well, it's time to go wrestle the world to its knees.
You really have been to the Erie Canal Museum, haven't you?
Twice.
Fitzgerald Art Foundation.
Is this Edgewood 5-0139?
I thought you were gonna go easy on that stuff.
You learn a lot more walking in uninvited.
You've already got most of the pieces.
Suppose you tell me how everything fits together.
When did that get here?
I have no idea.
Almost looks like she could step right out of the frame and kiss you.
Or laugh in your face.
Suppose she was alive, somewhere?
You trying to tell me something?
Just asking.
Not much chance of that, is there?
Men.
Why are you asking me about Shana now?
That was a long time ago.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm not asking you to apologize.
Then why are you asking me about her?
I thought about you when I was with her.
I feel almost normal.
Maybe I should go.
You always leave first.
Aren't you afraid people will notice that, too?
Because I can't stand to see you walk away from me.
Will I see you later?
I don't know.
Lose something, honey?
You all right?
Never better.
When you put a tail on somebody, you shouldn't trust it to an amateur.
Mona, how about fixing our guests a drink?
My own juice blend.
When I can get it.
You thirsty?
Not especially.
- Then let's blow.
You piqued my interest.
True love honey, just can't kill it.
Nix.
I'm only going to tell you this once.
You're not sure about anything.
Look at where you are right now and tell me you're not cracking up.
Let 'em go.
Thanks for the buffet.
I want you to know, that was the last carrot stick.
Not all of them.
Is it because they wear hats and the blood gets stuck in their heads?
I don't know.
- You know, I heard that's what causes baldness.
Are you okay?
I will be.
Fitzgerald as in Fitz?
Well, I figure, you're the one who works at the switchboard.
You could be the one to find out.
So when you're done with the roll you take it to the drugstore and a week later you pick up your pictures.
Oh, by yourself?
No, not alone.
She isn't.
- What changed?
- I don't know.
Yes, I do.
I fell in love for the first time.
That's when I lost all my interest in tree climbing.
I guess you just grow out of it.
That's what they say.
I'll tell you what I know about people.
They're no damn good.
He makes mistakes.
Walks into trouble with his eyes wide open and ends up in trouble all by himself.
I have some information that might help you with all that trouble.
What's this information gonna cost me?
Consider it a gift, from one lodge brother to another.
Alison DiLaurentis is alive.
And Spencer Hastings knows how to find her.
Alison DiLaurentis is dead.
Says who?
It's a good likeness, don't you think?
That's why it's smart to disappear, you'll always be the girl in the painting.
That is immortality, my darling.
Were you watching?
Did you see him go after her?
Is he who you're afraid of?
Is that why you can't come back?
Can I get one straight answer from you about anything?
And what would be the fun of that?
Maybe you should be the one I'm afraid of.
I'm just trying to figure this out.
You have all the pieces.
So why can't you put them together?
Maybe you need a little more help from those special pills.
Look!
Sit down.
Is Alison alive or dead?
That's not what you said before.
Just confused.
Spencer doesn't get confused.
Spencer's the smart one.
Or maybe smart enough to help Ali fake the whole thing.
I always thought champagne was the most sophisticated thing in the world.
Well, it isn't.
You are.
I want to tell my friends, about us.
That's a big secret.
I mean, you want them to know everything about us, but do you know everything about them?
Do you know all their secrets?
The important ones.
I bet you don't.
Alison's alive.
Can you put through Mr. Kane on Lockwood-3?
Just one moment, I'll connect you to your party.
Listen, mabel, I'm trying to track down one crummy phone number.
How many favors have I done for you?
Remember those three sailors?
I want to know which one.
Just one moment, I'll connect you to the long-distance operator.
So many people in this city.
Why does it feel so lonely?
Are you afraid of being lonely?
I'm afraid of being alone.
I won't let that happen.
I'm scared.
Me, too.
What if people find out?
Then they will be insanely jealous of me.
My boss is Mr. Fitzgerald, and I lost a very important phone number.
It'd be from Alison.
Could you check that for me?
Secrets aren't just secrets.
I learned that from Ali.
I know something else.
"A monster like that, you have to take care of it, nurture it."
It all made "A" stronger.
You know who "A" is.
She's alive and you know how to find her.
Since when does the devil give out free samples?
Think about it.
I don't want to think about it.
"Down these mean streets a girl must go, who is not herself mean."
You all right?
The Spencer look.
The look that you give everyone when you're really disappointed in them.
I'll try.
I've been seeing Ezra again.
Really seeing him, if you know what I mean.
I think so.
You said it yourself.
I liked Jake, but I love Ezra.
I do love Ezra.
Who are you trying to convince?
And it probably wouldn't have happened to me if I hadn't walked through that one door that one time.
It all would have been different.
And who decides what door you walk through, anyway?
It was perfect.
I think the story is changing.
Aria, there's something that I have to tell you, but I'm afraid I'm going to get a lot more from you than just a look.
What is it?
I've been leaving you messages everywhere.
What happened?
I found Ali.
You think that Alison's in there?
It looks like somebody threw a hand grenade into a room full of rockettes.
Well, this is where the call came from.
Did anybody see you come in here?
I mean, are you trying to get me killed?
This one already tried once.
Don't talk to me like that.
Don't talk to us like that.
Ali we want you back.
Are you sure about that?
I bet this one would love it if something happened to me.
That way she wouldn't have to worry about dropping down to second place if I came back.
Start thinking for yourself, instead of letting Spencer think for you.
Let's see how long you last out here without us.
Spencer, what are you talking about?
You're setting us up for something.
Has she told you?
Told me what?
Get whoever it is to follow us so you can get away?
Don't even think about it.
What are you talking about?
Who sharpened your tongue, little girl?
It's safe.
I don't know what they've told you about me, but it's not true.
You guys gonna tell her, or is that supposed to be my job?
Well, somebody better tell me something.
I'll keep you safe Aria, I promise.
I love you.
No one has ever loved you the way I do.
You can't trust him.
Why?
Go.
Why did Toby hit him?
Ali was right.
None of us has any guts.
You figure it out yet?
I wish you'd stop saying that.
Have you?
No matter who gets hurt.
You're all the time talking about wanting the answer.
Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
What is that supposed to mean?
Maybe you're afraid of finding out the whole truth.
In the book?
Don't look at the book, look at the pages.
That's the same thing.
Because now it's a trojan horse.
What's ambrose pavilion?
I don't know, but it was a big enough clue that whoever stole this book wanted to make sure we never saw it, in fact that we saw something else.
But "A" doesn't know that I have the original pages on my phone.
Which means he knows we know.
We have to tell Aria.
She's still not answering.
Then we'll sit on her porch until she gets back from Albany.
Syracuse.
Guys.
- Did you miss me?
There's someone Ali is so afraid of, she can't come back.
And CeCe's been busy running from the cops 'cuz she killed Wilden.
Do you think that I had something to do with Ali's murder?
You're having a tough time with your withdrawal.
He used us!
I found some stuff out I think can really help you.
Ezra thinks that "A" is Ali's mom.
Mrs. DiLaurentis saw me pick up a shovel and go after Ali.
How did you find me?
Look, we want to help you, but you need to tell us what happened that night.
Then you need to come here.
Alison, are you in there?
What are you doing here?
I cannot believe we let Noel bring us here.
Do we think she's even coming?
I don't know, when I saw it was him instead of Ali, I thought for sure this was a trap.
OK, well, whatever, they both quack.
Geese honk.
Why would Ali trust Noel Kahn?
Because he has secrets, too.
I want to hug you and slap you at the same time.
I could use a hug.
I need your help.
Now that the cops know that I'm not the one they buried, they're gonna start looking again.
And until I know who "A" is, I can't come home.
Ali, we think your mom's the one who stole the game from Mona.
We think she's "A."
You don't seem surprised.
It's complicated, Em.
I've never figured out the right way to tell you what you need to know.
And this time it's gonna be for good.
Want some coffee?
Did you just get lucky or did someone turn me in?
Who would have done that?
Look, we know Wilden was a jerk.
He was on the take and willing to rough people up to get what he wanted.
Maybe he took you out to that lake to scare you.
Things got out of hand and you did what you needed to do to stop him.
We also have an eyewitness that can place you at the scene.
We're just waiting for him to come in to I.D. you.
If I did do it, maybe I had a good reason for it.
I'm gonna need more than coffee if you want to hear what happened.
We have you on the hook for a murder charge.
If you're looking to make a deal I'm not sure what you have to bargain with.
So who killed her?
The same person who's still trying to hurt my friend.
- Which friend is that?
So if you want me here to help you figure out who "A" is, you must not think I'm the one who hurt you.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Spencer.
It was a crazy night and it all starts in Hilton Head.
"A" had been threatening me since that Halloween.
It's Alison.
Listen, she doesn't mean anything to me.
- Ian, I know she's here!
Ian, move!
Just let me take care of this so we don't make a scene, OK?
I'm going to handle this!
Fine, OK, I won't.
Because if you do, someone's gonna get hurt.
"Jenna and Toby?"
Melissa, you were the one who wanted to take a break.
Those videos changed the game.
I thought you'd see it my way.
Oh, and, Jenna, if I get one more threat, or you ever come back to Rosewood, I'll bury you.
Oh, it's Ashley Marin.
Did you find Hanna?
What is it you think these girls are guilty of?
I'm not sure they're guilty of anything, but we do have probable cause to believe they know the whereabouts of a missing person.
Surprise!
So when you got that text, you just crossed Jenna off your list?
I realized that everyone I suspected... even the four of you, were somehow compromised on those videos.
How could this happen?
I don't understand.
It's not a discussion.
We planned this ages ago, and you said it was OK.
I know things about that family that you don't.
Really, like what?
I've seen what they're capable of.
For once in your life please don't push me on this.
Call it a night, go upstairs to your room.
And is there any news?
Please hurry, I'm very, very worried.
Please send someone.
Of course.
That's so not funny, Alison.
I'm loving her new video.
Maybe a little too much, Em.
Your turn.
Drink up.
What do you want, Toby?
I can't believe you drugged us.
I can't believe we were suspects.
I wasn't always the best friend to you guys.
So you work here?
Toby told me he wanted you to know you did him a favor.
He said he was free at last.
He said his time in juvie got him away from Jenna, and he was actually grateful to me.
That's how I knew he wasn't "A."
And it was the last time I saw him.
You're not going anywhere.
You said Spencer was away for a few days last week.
Are you questioning all the girls' parents?
We're doing everything we can to find your daughters.
You're free to leave whenever you like.
But you should know there's a sea of reporters out there.
You probably want to wait here until we can clear a path for you.
I'll give you some privacy.
I got the warrant to track the GPS on the girls' phones and Spencer's car.
We'll have their location within the hour.
Good, keep me posted.
I've always looked out for my sister.
So when I ran into her boyfriend in London, and he said she missed me, I decided to come home.
Miss Hastings, do you mind if I record this?
I should probably ask my mom about that.
Your wife is on her way.
Do you have any idea where your daughter is?
If I did, would I be sitting here talking with you?
So why don't you tell me what you're doing to find her.
You guys, we can't let her leave, again.
Ezra seemed to get that everything I said was made-up stuff.
But he believed me when I said that CeCe and I were roommates at UPenn.
We hung out a lot at this pub near Hollis.
That's where I met Ezra.
Excuse me, can I have a gin and tonic?
It's tragic, isn't it?
Oh, sorry?
What's better to read than Tender Is the Night while you're sunning in the French Riviera?
Do people still do that?
So, you're a bit of a fabulist.
- What does that mean?
He said I reminded him of Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
He wanted to write a story about me.
Do we need to hear the rest of this?
I thought it was a compliment because Audrey Hepburn played her in the movie, but turns out she was a big phony who couldn't even name her cat.
She didn't name her cat because she didn't think she deserved to be loved.
They were just a couple of poor no-name slobs.
Everything.
Look, it is one thing to make up stories about how you spent your summer, but to lie to a guy and say that you're 21, when you're still in high school...
That's not the point.
Then what are you so freaked out about?
God help me, Alison, I actually like you.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
You're an all right guy.
And then I walked to the Kissing Rock to see Ian.
No hard feelings, right?
Look... why don't we just end this on a positive note, OK?
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- And you're going to jail.
You know, we never had sex, Alison.
So, I didn't do anything wrong.
I saw your home movies, Ian.
What does N.A.T. stand for anyway?
If I get one more text or stupid doll, you're going to be buying your soap on a rope.
Well, I guess you better go back to that posse of pervs and tell them to leave me alone.
Ian was more freaked out than I thought he was going to be.
He took off out of there like a plucked peacock.
Geez, Hanna!
Sorry.
- Aria, you OK?
- Yeah.
Ezra's still looking for me, Aria.
But it's not about the book now, it's about you.
What would you know about that?
He found Shana in Georgia.
He knows that we were in touch, and he offered to help.
He thinks if he saves me, he'll win you back.
Do you even want to be saved?
I know how I treated people.
I deserved a lot of what I got.
I think I deserve a second chance.
What happened after Ian left?
I went back to the barn.
I've been waiting for you.
It was business related.
You sure it wasn't Spencer related?
Her name is all over the file he gave you.
I thought this was about finding Spencer, not accusing her of something.
In hindsight you knew it was the drugs, that must have been a rough summer.
Cell reception's better in the lobby.
Police are asking pointed questions about Spencer.
Do we still have an understanding?
I just found out that my daughter is still alive, Peter.
That's all I'm thinking about right now.
Mrs. DiLaurentis, can we talk to you?
Where is your mother?
God, they know.
I must have missed something.
I did everything I could to protect her.
You think Spencer killed that girl.
I was pushing all summer for you to tell Melissa about Ian because I wanted to break them up.
I thought that Ian actually liked me and that Melissa was in the way.
And I told you to forget it, but you were holding on to it like a dog with a bone.
Why don't you put that thing down before you hurt yourself?
Are you speeding?
When I saw the pills, I put it together.
You weren't asleep because you were wired.
Spencer, look at me.
Don't take any more of these tonight, OK?
And never take them with alcohol.
It'll be our secret.
That's what friends are for.
Go back and just sleep it off, OK?
You know how much it will hurt Aria if you make that call.
I don't think that you're that horrible of a person.
Well, then you clearly don't know me that well.
Then I went back to the barn and waited for another text.
Nothing came.
It wasn't you, Spencer.
I didn't do it.
But your mom saw who did.
Why didn't she tell the police?
I could hear her talking to someone.
God, I can't believe your mom buried you alive.
Are you sure she thought you were dead?
The person she's still protecting.
That's why she was pointing the finger at me because she's still covering for somebody.
Yeah, but who?
I was so scared, so I ran.
I still can't believe somebody tried to kill you.
I'm scared for you, Alison.
I'm scared for me, too.
If this "A" person who's after you was willing to bash your head in, what's stopping them from trying again?
Nothing.
Maybe you should die.
Let "A" think you're dead.
I'll take care of you.
Pretty girl.
Come here.
Look at yourself.
Ditch the glasses and the barrettes.
Have Kim at The Salon do your hair and ask for Cindy at the make-up counter.
Buy everything she tells you to and never go to school without your face on.
Now, burn those knee socks, tell Mandi at The Boutique that Vivian sent you.
You don't have to be a loser, Mona.
Thanks, Ali.
Mom's talking to Sandra King.
She's the best criminal defense lawyer in the state.
Dad, Spencer didn't kill that girl.
I don't think we're going to figure this out tonight.
But you shouldn't leave, Ali.
I can't go back until I figure out why my mom was willing to do that to me.
It was surprisingly easy for me to stay gone.
Until you got hurt, Hanna.
I was so scared that you were going to die.
It was worth the risk.
I tried to keep one step ahead of "A," and I did everything I could to keep you safe.
I'm doing it because I love her.
What are you doing here?
Were you at the Lodge the night of the fire?
Did you see who pulled us out?
Guys, I think someone's out there.
Is that Noel?
There's no way out of here.
There's no way that's your mom.
You stay awake, do you hear me?
Don't you dare close your eyes!
- Let's be sure about that.
- I'll talk to Adam.
- Maybe it's smarter to avoid contact.
Somebody has to respond, whether it's him, or us, or both.
We have to coordinate, and do it carefully.
Let me take care of this.
Well, let's just think this through.
- I've got it covered, Francis.
- We'll shut this down, sir.
- There can't be any doubt.
- Let's walk through a timeline.
Claire must be the surgeon.
Only she can stop the bleeding.
You know we got them plates in there.
Approval over all the marketing materials.
Approval over the staff hires of the flagship in Silver Spring.
- So, what next?
Just have to wire it from our main account into the LLC, cut a cashier's check for you.
It's a mockup of the bottle design.
And we already started on the concept layouts for the Silver Spring location.
- Why's that linoleum peeling up?
- To make it seem real.
Well, I wanted it to look nicer than this.
We can scratch the peeling linoleum, but we don't want it to look too nice.
You want them white folks to feel like they slummin' it.
- No, to have an authentic atmosphere.
They don't just want the ribs, they want the experience, but without having to leave the suburbs for it.
We're not selling candlelit dinners here.
But I promise, nothing gets built without your signing off.
So, what do you want me to do?
- I need you to deny it.
You can say we had a business relationship, but that you didn't take the picture of me in the bed.
Whatever you think is best.
Thank you, Adam.
I watched you when you did the CNN interview.
I promised myself I wouldn't, but I couldn't help it.
It's a shame it takes this for us to talk to one another.
I should go.
So I won't talk to the press until I get instructions.
That's right.
- It's good to hear your voice.
- You finished?
- Yeah.
I don't need anything.
Gotta buy somethin' if you want to get inside.
You need to get the fuck on outta my way.
Open up.
Forgive me, Frank, but you know I have to ask.
If it were true, I would tell you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go throw the hounds a bone.
- I know it's demeaning...
- Not another word.
I should've been more careful.
We'll put this behind us, just like we've always done.
- Part of me wishes...
That you'd be more upset.
Wasted energy, isn't it?
For both of us.
Shall we rehearse?
- I don't need your help.
- This ain't a handout.
Work for you?
I'm gonna get the house either way.
You in the easy chair, laying into me every time I come in and out the door.
You sure this nigga ain't just selling' you smoke?
Says it right in the contract, 95 Gs no matter what.
I don't know, man.
- Still don't wanna see you.
Well, here I am.
Get the fuck outta here, old man.
You listen to me, boy.
I never had nothing to give you.
I didn't have no money, and you didn't want whatever I had.
But we talking about a house.
DeShawn deserves to live better than in a place like this.
You know where to find me.
See you, kid.
I'm gonna let the vice president and his wife speak for themselves.
Why has it taken them almost a full day to respond?
I'm sure you can understand they wanted to consult with legal counsel first regarding defamation and slander.
You're saying they will deny the affair.
I'm saying they'll be out here in 30 minutes and you can quote them instead of me.
- What, waiting?
No, the affair.
You'd rather be stuck at the White House all day?
To do something meaningful with my time.
Hey, I need you to book me a flight to St. Louis.
Tonight, if you can find something.
So I'm not sure why he would deny taking the photograph.
I love Adam's work, so I asked him to take this portrait.
It was a birthday present.
They're fucking lying.
You made me look like an idiot.
If we had the same story, the media would assume we were coordinating.
- It needed to look messier.
You just need to confirm that you took the photo for us.
I don't know why you didn't just tell me this is what you were intending to do.
I wasn't trying to be manipulative--
- I have to go.
I think he'll do the right thing.
Wake me if he goes on TV.
- Doug, why don't you and Seth come over?
Should we consider a lawsuit against the paper?
- Show we won't tolerate this sort of gossip?
- They won't settle.
They'll fight it in the courts because it'll generate more news.
And what about the president?
He offered to say something.
- Draws attention.
- President isn't a bad idea, if we phrase a statement for him.
If we coordinate with them--
Coordination looks bad.
So it's your job to conceal it.
If Seth doesn't think the president should make a comment, we should defer to his judgment.
I'm gonna get another beer.
- I have to drive, but thanks.
I'll be right back.
- Watch yourself.
- What do you mean?
Connor was an easy target, but I'm not going anywhere.
Look, Doug, I'm grateful just to be here.
You think I've survived with the vice president so long by being blind?
Upward mobility has a ceiling with the Underwoods.
- I'm the ceiling.
- Understood.
- What else have you got on them?
- Nothing.
- You can't expect me to believe you.
- I don't.
A little sibling rivalry isn't such a bad thing, especially between adopted boys.
They either push each other to be the best versions of themselves, or one of them gets booted back to the orphanage.
One Diet Coke for you, and one beer for you.
Thank you, sir.
The press have been harassing us the past two days.
Yeah, we barely made it out of the building without being trampled.
- He's in my office.
- Did he tell you who he was?
He says he used to work for the Underwoods.
- Who?
- Your assistant.
- No, she would never--
- She would and she did.
- And who is that?
- That doesn't concern you.
This is my life you're fucking with.
You and I are just pawns, Mr. Galloway.
- You should leave.
- We need more to prove the affair happened.
Another photograph.
Thirty seconds, you better be out the door.
I'm not going anywhere.
You recognize the country code?
And the city code is Bogotá.
Is it still ringing?
Something else, ain't it?
Looks like you could use some help.
Got a extra apron in the back.
What's her name?
Ayla Sayyad, Wall Street Telegraph.
She's part of the vice president's press corps.
I appreciate it, Tricia, but I'm fine.
- Did Adam speak with them?
Tricia, can I call you back?
I mean, it could be, yes.
It probably is.
I asked you about any vulnerabilities.
I didn't know he took this.
Well, I visited him last fall.
He had friends over, to his apartment.
There's nothing wrong with me visiting him, being at a party.
There is if this photo is on the front page of the Daily.
Politics and business are intertwined in China, as I'm sure you know.
It's not uncommon to partner with someone who can ensure Beijing's approval.
So you needed his political influence.
Right after the Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.
Well, I had nothing to do with that project.
- Neither did Feng, to my knowledge.
- No, but Wu Bin Yang did.
He's Feng's biggest rival in Beijing.
Well, it looks like I shouldn't be schooling you on Chinese politics.
That's the sense I'm getting from all of this.
My gut says there's more to Xander Feng than has been reported.
It's not real news.
My wife got this for me when she visited there before the revolution.
- It's beautiful.
- Sixteenth century.
It, um, broke when it was being shipped, into a thousand pieces.
It took specialists over a year to restore it.
- Here, I want you to have it.
- I can't accept gifts.
If you're going to threaten me, you don't have to go to the trouble of veiling it.
Usually interested in just finding a way to knock me down a peg.
America can be just as dangerous as Iran, Ms. Sayyad.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Tusk.
Travel safe back to Washington.
Get Remy on the line.
- Remy's on line two.
Best day yet.
That's too much money to be carrying around at night.
I can handle myself.
What the fuck you doin' bringing' that thing in here?
Oh, it's just for protection, man.
I don't know what you doing with it anyway.
What about your parole?
I'm a lot more worried about niggas in my building than some parole officer.
You being all righteous and judging' me and shit.
Maybe nothing' comes of it, but maybe something does.
But that means you gotta be careful.
That means you cannot be sent back inside.
- You gonna get rid of that thing?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Now that's what's being a man.
I'll need you to cut it.
- Do you want this job or not?
And before we go to the studio, I need to see how well-spoken you are.
Why does that matter?
Because you're gonna be on every news channel in America.
Wait, what's this for?
"Freddy Hayes was convicted in 1982 for sticking up a convenience store in Columbia Heights.
During a high-speed pursuit, Hayes lost control and crashed into another vehicle, killing an elderly couple.
- You think it's Tusk?
- Who else?
- Who are you texting?
All I want to do is make a short statement.
Freddy did his time, he's been an upstanding citizen for 20 years.
If the Galloway story wasn't happening, I'd say it's fine.
But it's too risky right now.
There is no way you win, standing up for this guy.
He's about to start a franchise.
I will not have it jeopardized because Tusk decided--
Yes, sir.
I won't leave one of my own bleeding on the field.
If you're gonna have the Washington Redskins, then you're gonna have to have the New York Knickers.
Pops, you ain't even deep like that.
- Darnell, just ignore them.
- You think I'm fucking around?
They can't take our pictures if we don't want them to.
The First fuckin' Amendment.
- Let's go on inside.
Oh, but you can get all up in my face but I can't get up in yours?
I will fuck you up.
Parole!
Can you tell me your name, please?
And this is you in this photo on the right?
- Yes, that's correct.
- We shot this photo yesterday with Ms. Daldry.
So you're suggesting that Mr. Galloway's photo is a fake?
Ultimately, though, it's gonna be your word against his.
My job is to separate fact from fiction, just like yours is, Candy.
But maybe fact and fiction don't matter as much to the artistic sensibility.
Maybe the lines are blurred for him.
This is not a man who stages fictitious scenarios.
But I would hate to think that Mr. Galloway was doing this just for publicity.
You think it's a publicity stunt.
Come on in.
- Sir?
- Is Freddy on his way?
There was an incident with his son.
- What happened?
- I have to go see him.
- That's the projects, sir.
I don't care, you figure it out, and the press can't know.
Yes, sir.
Freddy is dangerous because you care too much.
- When we care too much, it blinds us.
- What Tusk did is cheap.
And you're letting it get to you, which is exactly what he wants.
- If I ignore this, if I do nothing--
- It's not nothing.
Staying focused requires strength.
You should eat.
- These people.
I always knew they were ruthless, but...
We're caged up in here like animals.
They're painting me as some sort of...
They're fucking inhuman.
Getting worked up isn't going to change anything.
Let me.
- Hey, Frank.
- I'm fine.
- Thanks for dropping by.
- How you holdin' up?
I been better.
Ain't never seen you without a suit before.
We didn't want to draw too much attention.
Well, this is it, my castle.
Ain't as big as yours, but it'll do the job.
- Blind Willie.
- Are you a blues fan?
"Dark Was the Night." Gets me every time.
Man, you shoulda told me that years ago.
I'd like some iced tea, thank you.
- How's your son?
- They set the bail at 60 grand.
- Jesus.
- How's your wife doing?
Oh, Claire's got a suit of armor three inches thick.
We'll get through all this garbage.
- Somebody's tryin' to take you out?
- Appears that way.
Whoever it is, they done stepped on the wrong motherfuckin' rattlesnake.
That's why I'm here, Freddy.
I have to distance myself from you.
I need to make sure you're not going to play up what good friends we've been.
That you've been to my office, that you've cooked dinner at my home, or that the president was there.
We can't drag him into anything.
And I won't be coming in for ribs anymore.
With all that's going on, we can't add fuel to the fire.
You couldn't if you wanted to.
I'm selling it.
- Selling the Joint?
- That's right.
- What are you talking about?
- The franchise thing, with the sauce.
My business partner's pullin' out.
Say them white folks down in Silver Spring don't wanna go to no place run by thugs.
- Why do you have to sell yours?
- Darnell's bail.
That, with what little I got saved, I can pay that bond.
I ain't taking' your guilt money.
When I was bangin', we used to clear 60 Gs a month.
Then I got caught.
Darnell was born my first year in.
Never saw him once, not even a picture.
I can't take back the bad I done.
Ain't pride, Frank.
If you change your mind, you let me know.
You was a good customer, that's it.
You ain't gotta pretend to be my friend.
- You take care of yourself, Freddy.
- You too, Frank.
I wouldn't disagree with you.
The road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties.
Never regret.
This way.
Have a seat, Adam.
- And what did you tell your fiancée exactly?
And what will she say if someone checks in on her?
And I explained to you why that was necessary.
You didn't follow my instructions.
Do you know who Remy Danton is?
He approached you?
Inez's father is a human rights activist in Bogotá.
The government has charged him with treason for working with the rebels.
They're going for the death penalty, and Danton said they have the judge in their pocket.
- He's wrong.
- I wasn't gonna take any chances.
He's a journalist documenting atrocities in the Darien Gap.
- I can get the charges dropped.
- Why should I trust you?
- We're not your chess pieces.
And this isn't a game, Mr. Galloway.
That's a fucking joke, Claire.
Do not talk to my wife that way.
Oh, your wife?
What does that even mean to you?
Do not mistake any history you have shared for the slightest understanding of what our marriage is, or how insignificant you are in comparison.
- Can you give us a few minutes?
- I'm gonna go call Cathy.
We're going to make this disappear.
- I'm sorry it's come to this.
Now you're fucking with my life and the life of the woman that I love more than I ever loved you.
You'll be driven back to New York tonight.
In the morning, you'll make a statement saying this was a publicity stunt, and that the value of your work had been stagnating and you wanted to revive--
- How about I tell the press--
- Adam, shut up!
That you wanted the attention, then you got cold feet, denied it, then you changed your mind again.
- I'm not part of this world.
We're giving you an out, Adam.
It's a terrible feeling, isn't it?
- End call.
- Call ended.
Call Raymond Tusk.
No answer at his place.
Is it a matter of more money?
Secretary Durant has already called President Moreno.
So we need to move quickly.
The minister of foreign affairs is involved now.
The judge isn't gonna rush a conviction in less than 12 hours.
Well, who do we know who has the minister's ear?
Nobody who can trump President Moreno, and he's very sensitive to Durant's views on human rights.
- Are you giving up on this?
- I think we need to be prepared for the possibility that we can't follow through with our threat.
- I'll figure something out.
OK, that's good.
You don't have to do this.
Yeah, I do.
The charges are dropped.
Are you disappointed in me?
Let's just get it over with.
OK, go ahead.
I'd like to make a statement.
There will be a little cleanup, some folks who will want to linger on the story, but we're over the hump, I'd say.
So we can leave the house now?
The sooner you get back to normal work, the better.
- I need to push ahead with the assault bill.
- OK, let's get going.
I'll meet you in the car.
- Should we have any more concerns?
- He claims he doesn't have anything else.
- Do you believe him?
I wouldn't go that far.
- Keep an eye on him.
- I plan to.
As for Raymond, we have to strike back hard and fast.
I want him obliterated.
More than that.
Let's make him suffer.
I don't know whether to be proud or terrified.
Perhaps both.
Wish I could do more.
- What you gonna do with her?
- I don't know yet.
Nah.
I ain't one for lookin' back.
Eyes ahead.
Good luck, Freddy.
Four girls were meant to die and be reborn.
Someone jacked that power.
I believe that when you love someone and that person loves you in return, you're uniquely vulnerable.
Celeste.
This blade contains all the power I harvested from the vampires.
It will do things worse than death.
And are you ready for the final offering?
Someone help me.
We gather today for the first public service of our newly reopened church.
St. Anne's can finally once again be the heart of our community, where we can congregate as a people united.
Here, this hour, we come together to praise God and give thanks.
The events that took place at our church were tragic.
Problem?
...And it is that hope in our hearts and with the help of many benefactors that allows us to be here today.
Amen.
Each tomb is well cared for.
Families honor their dead with displays of affection and respect...
Please help me!
And if you look close, these fresh bricks tell us someone in the family has recently fallen.
Let me out!
Hello, Monique.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
It's a miracle.
I wasn't expecting you to join us.
Oh, we were hoping for some word from your human sources on the recent Haitian invasion.
He's called Papa Tunde.
And right now, he's wandering the corridor with the power he absorbed from every soul I had buried in the garden.
So you might want to put your ear a little closer to the ground.
Yes, Diego, what do you have for me?
Uh, we got a special delivery.
Would you care to elaborate?
Either our witch problems are over or they're just getting started.
God be with you.
Can I get you anything, brother?
A magnifying glass, a pipe perhaps?
You have a theory that you'd like to share with us, Niklaus?
Back in the day, the witches wanted to send a threat, they'd just kill a chicken and leave it on your doorstep.
It's rather a large and ominous chicken, wouldn't you say?
If he was supposed to be their prize fighter, why leave him for dead in our front yard?
It was Monique Deveraux.
What?
The tourists thought it was part of the show, but the witches are celebrating like it's some kind of bloody miracle.
I have a theory about who one of them could be...
First Papa Tunde returns to settle old scores.
They're declaring war on us.
It's not too early for scotch, is it, with all the witches' shenanigans and subterfuge afoot.
It is entirely too early if one intends to drive, yes.
She's not safe here.
You have to take Hayley to the plantation house until this is over.
Are you worried about Hayley or whether or not you can trust me?
It's precisely because I trust you that I'm asking you to do this.
Why are you dictating her fate?
You know why.
Then perhaps you should take her yourself.
Well, then that would make me the very hypocrite that you've accused me of being.
Rebekah, I cannot legislate my feelings.
My actions, however...
So would you kindly do this for me?
You know the mama wolf loves to be told what to do.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Listen, everybody's running off, looking for resurrected witches.
What?
But it looked like her.
And you and I both know she would have a reason to want to be back.
A lot of unfinished business, a lot of secrets that you and I don't want getting out.
End it like we did the last time.
Tea, please.
I'm busy.
Cami, just hear me out.
You know, I came to your reopening because I wanted to try and make amends.
And then I see you talking with Klaus out in the open, like it's business as usual in the quarter.
It is business as usual.
For the past 3 centuries, the O'Connells have always tried to keep the peace.
Uncle Kieran, what's wrong?
I'm in trouble.
What happened to your brother Sean is about to start happening to me.
What?
Of course there is.
Tonight's a full moon, Rebekah.
Of course.
Josh isn't dead yet?
Well, good on him.
I love a nice survival story.
Who the bloody hell is that?
Right.
It appears you weren't going to wait for me to grant you permission to throw a kegger.
Listen, you all want me safe, fine.
But tonight's the one night a month that I can meet my family.
Now, you could rat me out, send me to my room, or you could help me throw one hell of a party.
My family needs an ally among the witches, and you've helped us in the past.
Perhaps together we can avoid an unnecessary conflict.
They may be willing to make a deal if it were with the noble Elijah.
But there will never be any peace as long as it involves Klaus.
You have a niece on the way.
It stands to reason you'd be willing to discuss how to run him out of the city.
Let's walk together.
You can take me on one of your famous tours.
You should eat after everything you've been through.
I was dead.
But you're here now.
Aunt Sophie, what happened to mom?
Your mother loved you so much.
She had faith that she could use magic to complete the harvest and get you back.
In the end, she sacrificed herself for the cause, for the witches, for you.
And do you have her faith?
I lost my faith.
Then I realized that if I didn't believe, I would be letting you down.
I'm not here to threaten anyone.
What do you want, Marcel?
There were 3 more girls sacrificed during the harvest.
I want to bring them back.
Who are you kidding?
You don't care about those girls.
You just want Davina back so you can use her power again.
I just want her alive.
He's telling the truth.
How do you know that?
I can feel it.
In the attic resting, praying.
But the lies your Uncle told were meant to protect you.
And he is your family.
As for these witches, their attack on Kieran should be proof enough they're the enemy.
In that we are united.
This is Papa Tunde's blade.
A witch gave it to me.
Said it would cause untold pain and torment, even to an original.
She said if I stuck it in your heart, she would heal Kieran.
And yet you chose to reject their offer.
Maybe if I were more like you, I could do it.
But I'm not...
A monster.
I'm not stupid.
If there's a war going on, I want to be on the winning side.
Let's see what we can do about saving your Uncle, shall we?
Hello again.
I'm looking forward to meeting you soon.
You've got to be kidding me.
A vampire is trying to reverse a witch's hex placed on you, and it's the cup you find sacrilegious.
Are you sure this is going to work?
Not remotely.
Just do what you have to do.
I was expecting someone furrier.
I suppose you'll be wanting Hayley.
Or I could just talk to you.
I'm Rebekah.
Hayley, the party's here!
You got enough power left to find these witches?
I know the harvest was an epic fail, but I can still do a locator spell.
Before I do that, we need to make a deal.
What deal?
If I betray these witches, they're gonna come looking for me.
And if I'm caught, I'm dead.
I said I'd protect you.
If you could do that, you wouldn't need my help in the first place.
No way am I letting Monique get in the middle of that.
In order to get her out, I'm gonna need money.
Do we have a deal?
Find the witches, I'll give you anything you could ever need.
It's to hug our friends, our family, and to dance our asses off.
I seriously doubt you invited us here to wait on us.
It's nice to see you again.
You're the wolf who's been watching me.
But personally, my interest is in you.
You don't even know me.
Our parents knew each other.
They were of the same people but not the same bloodline.
Now, you know how pack hierarchy works, right?
What part was that?
You were supposed to be my wife.
So this next part of town is one of the few areas where any of the original French architecture remains.
Most of the buildings were destroyed in the 1700s, when the city burned for the first time.
Am I putting you to sleep?
As surprising as you might find this, it's not every day that someone asks you to betray your own brother...
How did you know?
And if so, then who?
And then I recalled the lovely Sabine.
You know who I am.
Original vampire, always wears a suit?
Your visions of my brother's child precipitated the death of the last elder within your coven...
Tell them what you saw.
I died because of Klaus.
And even after all his vindictive lies about witches led to my death, you stood by him all because of your vow, "always and forever."
I'm here to teach you the error of your ways.
"Always and forever" was the greatest mistake of your life.
I think you've suffered enough.
All I know is that the vervain is out and I'm at the mercy of this murderous bastard.
What are we going to do?
I'm weaker than I thought.
You want the deal, Soph, you got to hold up your end.
I'm on a clock.
It's working.
That's one.
Or don't.
We may have time for more.
But then that leaves Rebekah, your tragic sister.
She's about to find herself in quite the predicament.
You could save her.
She has no idea how dangerous it is to be loved by you.
You'll recover with just enough time to choose one.
Who will it be?
I can't wait to find out.
What a shame it would be were I forced to send her back to the death she's just escaped.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm opening negotiations.
The stench of witches hangs in the air.
Mark my words.
I will end this girl with the very blade you meant for me.
I know it's a lot to take in.
You think?
I just wanted to meet my family.
I never imagined I'd meet my husband from some weird-ass arranged marriage.
I guess you don't know about any of this because there was never anyone around to teach you.
I guess that makes us kind of like royalty.
The vampires came after us.
And if our families were united, we could have taken them.
So our parents decided to bring the two lines back together.
And you and I were betrothed.
Look, obviously things didn't work out the way anyone thought they would.
You are the last one of your bloodline, Andrea.
Or, Hayley, whatever you call yourself.
These people will follow you.
You can help them... you and what you represent.
And what is that exactly?
A time when things were different, when our people fought back.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
I really do like you, but this is the deal we made.
What's going on?
What?
You know what to do.
We have to get out of here.
On your feet.
Help me.
It's been such a long time, Rebekah.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Missing something?
And Genevieve knows where your sister is.
Bastiana has Klaus tucked away someplace safe.
He's suffering horribly, I might add, and all because you chose to save the little wolf instead of your own blood.
I guess "always" isn't forever after all.
I never thought it would go like this.
I promise.
Klaus, where are you?
Mr. Mikaelson is currently indisposed.
What happened?
What did you do?
You see, dear, you failed to hold up your end of our bargain.
You chose instead to side with evil as your Uncle has done many times before you.
His suffering will purify him.
You'd do well to heed his lesson, girl.
To oppose us is to oppose the natural order.
By choice or by force, the witches of the French quarter will rise again.
Where is my brother?
Klaus threw one of his classic temper tantrums, snapped my neck, tried to take on a coven of witches by himself.
Every one of you will help me to find them.
I'm going to kill them all.
He's gonna kill me as soon as he's recovered.
But you can still have a normal life, one without all this crazy witch nonsense.
I should have known better.
You tried to stop the harvest.
Please don't do this.
Now you want to run when we need to stay and fight.
"Both now and forever, be this your endeavor, when wrong with the right is at strife.
But bright honor and labor and truth to your neighbor will bear you safe over life's seas."
Now commences our sun-kissed summer, ladies and gentlemen.
We sprinkle the sea with gold and the sea gives it back to us 100 fold.
That is the glory of this blessed strand that we call Atlantic City.
Now that's how you get yourself along.
The ceremony concludes and libations await compliments of the corner hotel.
To the wagons, ho!
I hate this.
It sells mojitos.
Where is the goddamn son of a bitch?
He'll show.
Four days late?
You said you liked Cuba.
What makes you think I don't?
This conversation.
I just want the deal to be nailed down.
Trust me or not?
Of course I do.
Then shut up and dance.
My customers are watching.
Unload it.
Get moving, stripeys.
Get your tools and get to work.
Keep moving.
My wife was desperate to come.
Aw, shame she couldn't join you, senator.
Well, it's important to learn the facts on the ground.
The great engineer has backed himself into a corner.
This is all just exploratory, understood?
Constitutional amendments don't get overturned.
You have friends who believe otherwise.
Men like that tend to get what they want.
You said it yourself, good for the country, good for you and me.
He doesn't talk much.
That's what I like about him.
Let's just be clear.
Certain issues regarding your past make moving forward tricky.
I'm not sure what you mean.
Do I have to spell it out?
1923, I bought a pint of old granddad in union station in Washington DC.
Wendell, if America's not about starting over, where's the hope for any of us?
Senator, I hear you're a bit of an expert on foreign trade.
I'm on the senate subcommittee.
Well, that young lady, she is very interested in the subject.
Would you be willing to share some of your experience?
I believe you intended to see a "fillum," Mr. Bennett.
Is it?
No, sir.
Enjoyed it tremendously.
Then you know what I'm talking about.
Gorilla, dancing seals, baby tiger.
At one point, Mickey finds a piano...
Not important.
He sails away on a turtle?
Sails away on a turtle!
Conors Gould is strong.
It is a grand time to make some money.
Fix this?
Cross and cross again.
See?
It's called a reef knot.
You try.
Eli.
Mom might need us.
Close the door.
What were the ladies wearing?
One was in a sort of yellow bonnet and green skirt and green jacket about to here.
It's called a bask.
There's cold bread and molasses.
I had the oysters, ma.
Well, here's something you don't have.
Someone was throwing it away.
It's full of interesting things.
Your man was up to his tricks today, wasn't he?
Sir?
He opened the sea.
Does he own that, too, now?
Just for the city people.
Gold in the water.
All the little fishies biting.
Go on.
So what did you catch, hmm?
You catch some gold, little fish?
No, sir.
Why not?
I wasn't quick enough.
It took your mother three days to birth you.
I was out on the water.
I didn't know if I was a father or a widower.
A boy in her arms.
My boy.
Finish that.
The goddamn hell is this guy?
Nothing happens on time here.
Here, you pick 'em.
I give you the good ones.
What?
- What are they saying?
- Anti-Machado stuff.
Another day in paradise.
Always complaining about something.
Might wind up doing more than that.
Meyer.
Meyer.
One of us is still a bachelor.
What's his story?
Man on vacation.
Just like you.
Morning, folks.
It is still morning, isn't it?
Wendell, where have you been?
Tell the truth, I'm not exactly sure.
I don't have it.
Go look.
You just hide here and pray for wind?
Onward to rustic pleasures!
Don't worry yourself.
Some water maybe?
Bucket.
Well, Hoss, I wasn't but nine and pappy say, "Milton", you know what that is?
That's an ass backwards.
"Ass like that do everything in reverse."
Grab hold of that bushy tail, yell, "geeyup!"
Whoo, and that mule tossed me like a baseball on Sunday.
Ain't none left.
Tie that boot.
Says who?
Did you?
They're not so special.
All they have is money.
Ways to find that, I reckon.
How?
Get yourself there first.
Give me your hand, sue.
Sour.
I like it.
Signore, how may I please you?
Furthest from the door.
How are you feeling?
Sir?
How do you feel?
I... shocked?
And saddened.
What did you do for Mr. Bennett?
I sometimes ran errands for Mrs. Bennett.
Shopping and the like.
Mr. Bennett assured me secretaries were expected to carry out duties of that nature.
Was that improper?
Not married?
No, Mr. Conors.
Family?
Brother and sisters.
Time you found a husband.
Am I to be let go?
Do you know where he kept the key to the file cabinet in his office?
No.
We need to open the file cabinet.
I don't know where he kept it.
Good.
What you doing now?
Fixing up that boot, huh?
Yeah, that's smart.
Rub it all in, keep it real soft.
Don't you never want to say nothing?
What you done in the first place?
Got myself caught.
You sure do weave a tale.
I stove my pappy's head in is what.
I said let's go.
Always the last one sitting.
Fuck every motherfucking one of y'all.
How they fit a body's voice inside that little box?
Electricity.
Money in a house outside Thurmont.
Split it with you.
You handle all the telephones and such.
How did you wind up running the company, Mr. Ronis?
Married the boss's daughter.
Well, lucky girl.
And your market?
Is it so, senator Lloyd?
It was you, me, Sally, and what was the senorita's name?
She was paying particularly close attention.
Speaking privately among friends, the country is ready to move forward.
And that is an opportunity.
Don Maxime, I have a distribution network already in place.
The day repeal passes, I intend to be open for business legally in the thirstiest country on earth with Bacardi rum as my most exclusive offering.
Can the two of us come to an arrangement?
A bodyguard?
So build a plant in Mexico.
Well, it's always wise to have an exit arranged.
A man like yourself would understand that.
I found the key.
I come, 16 year old.
You pulled yourself up, Joe.
Every day a fight.
But one man, one boss.
I don't work no other way.
Maranzano's got the same idea.
_
And me... _
All this time, I stuck with you.
How you take care of it?
Just leave that to me.
What you don't know, you can't get nailed for.
Joe.
How much more you want to lose?
One boss.
We gonna sit here all day?
Where you got to go?
Do what you need to.
- What the fuck took so long?
- Traffic the whole way.
Had to be done, right?
A man needs to get out of town every now and then.
That's just the glory of the whole proposition.
They have beaches in Brooklyn.
Then why don't you do it yourself?
I need the New York money.
Just think, rail line straight down from the Jersey crossing.
I told them no congregating.
Sheriff's meant to be obeyed, boy.
This is his.
Well?
Here you go.
Found my hat, didn't you?
It's too much.
Compared to what?
Did you know that money was there?
Yes, sir.
Then why didn't you take it?
Answer true.
To get myself ahead.
No boys on the porch.
Scram.
Can we talk for a moment?
And I'm not here to get tarred with someone else's brush.
Are you listening to me?
What happened to the ones I already bought?
I've had that seat for 20 years.
Pretenders reach for the throne, but only Caesar can rule.
And the pretenders fade away.
What does it all mean?
And my thoughts are these.
A new friend is here tonight.
We owe him much.
Come forward.
The hero.
Don Salvatore.
_
They want something for nothing.
They steal, they rob.
A rich American on the street, an opportunity.
He says there are formalities concerning the incident.
How much to keep it quiet?
200.
Thank you, young man.
Here you are.
Let's go.
Whose boy are you?
Ethan Thompson's.
Ethan the bay man.
You know him?
Thought you were being clever before, hmm?
Thought you were gonna get something for being honest.
What have you got?
Everything goes through me, understand?
Big and little.
Absecon inlet to great egg harbor.
Anything else is bad for business.
Yes, sir.
You saw what he did with the ear?
Is it still in his pocket?
Ronis doesn't need to hear about any of this.
As far as he's concerned, nothing's happened and Lloyd's still on board.
A man like me?
Where's the sense in looking back?
Never does any good.
"Be honest and true, boys."
Come up to the room.
Sweetie, I'm not alone.
Not all bad news.
Won five pesos.
Mrs. Lansky.
Do you speak English?
I speak, yes.
You have a husband?
We go around the corner, I'll make you feel good.
Don't think life plain sailing, there's danger of failing, though bright the futures seem to be...
But bright honor and labor and truth to your neighbor will bear you safe over life's seas.
Then up and be doing, right only pursuing, and take your fair part in the strife.
Actually, Mandy, it's exactly what it looks like.
What's gonna happen to us?
If you're smart, you'll say nothing.
If Joe were alive, he would have contacted you.
The ones from the subway are still out there.
So you planned these murders to lure Joe out of hiding.
I believe in you, Joe.
I want chocolate milk!
Good morning!
Yes, she does.
Where's Billy?
The man did.
Honey, what man?
The man who talks funny.
Children are such precious gifts, aren't they, Jana?
Joe, you're alive!
Lily Gray is the primary suspect in the murder of two federal agents at her Soho art gallery.
We also are now viewing her as a person of interest in the recent subway slayings.
Tell us about the raid in Burlington.
Have you eaten?
But if she's a part of it, why would she put herself in the subway?
She knows my background, she knows my history with the case, how I get too attached to the victims.
That's so sick.
This woman has no violent history, no record, not even a traffic ticket.
Luring who out?
Joe Carroll because he's still alive.
Well, if that's what's happening, then you need to prove it.
Well, maybe they can, but it will take them 6 months.
I know how to bury it, and pick up some disposable phones--
I'm not gonna lose my job, and so what if I did?
There's no one else.
You know, um, until last year, we hadn't said 5 words to each other since my dad died, and I feel like you and me, dad would have liked this version of us.
So you don't get to decide what I do.
If something happened to you, that would end me.
Now you know how I feel.
Is Emma Hill with Lily Gray?
She was orphaned at a young age.
She inherited all businesses, properties, holdings, all on the up and up.
Now money is not the most interesting thing about this woman.
Hilda Barkov, a Russian housekeeper who maintained her father's estates, she died giving birth to twin boys.
Court order's in the works.
I missed this place.
He'll call.
I'm more concerned we have the proper response when he does.
He's convinced we traded a pawn for a queen.
Mom!
Oh, she's back in town taking care of David since Luke failed to do so at the museum.
Actually, Mark failed to do so, mother.
Really?
Very good.
I'm sure you're a little overwhelmed, but this is my family, and you're so welcome.
It's so big.
What do you want to play now?
Let's play wedding.
Her mom?
Sadly no longer with us.
Joe, I was here, I waited, and you never showed.
I took a detour.
I know what you came for.
Who is Lily Gray?
That is the question authorities are asking this morning as she remains at large.
And if a killer gets away in the meantime, that's okay with you?
FBI know you're there.
Well, they're tailing me, so, yeah, but they didn't invite me here.
What are you doing here, Giselle?
Lily sent me.
Well, I'd like to speak with her.
She needs a lawyer to help clean up this mess.
She should sue them for what they're saying about her.
She appreciates your concern.
You think you're helping your uncle, but you're hurting him, and you're interfering with a federal investigation.
Are you of the opinion that Carroll's alive, as well?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, you do.
Now I have tried, but I can't seem to get through to him.
If you care about him, if you care about your career, you'll stop.
Now he's hurt and traumatized, and he is grieving over Claire, but you and I both know Joe Carroll is dead.
I'm trying to help.
It was good to meet you, Max.
It's beautiful, isn't it, peaceful, scenic?
See that dramatic contrast between shadow and light?
Not really.
Maybe we can change that.
I want you to tell him the truth.
What is the truth exactly?
Ask me anything you want.
Can you tell me anything about Joey?
Your son is deep in Witness Protection with his grandmother.
Someone's reached out to me.
A follower?
The murders in New York.
Only a slight few know how to leave a message for me.
I need to know if it's safe for me to answer.
You have quite a diverse family.
Discards from across the globe, kids whom no one wanted, displaced by violence or neglect.
I used to be one of them.
You?
My father killed my mother, and then he took his own life when I was a child.
My mother was a maid, and he was convinced I was the progeny of her wealthy employer Martin Jansen.
He thought they had an affair.
Was it true?
Maybe.
After they died, Martin took care of me, sent me to the best schools, bought me anything I desired, but he was-- he was never a parent.
I think you know what that's like, to grow up bereft of a parent's love.
You've done your research?
I know your mother didn't love you the way you needed her to.
That's behind me.
I think she didn't see your strength, your intelligence, your beauty.
Why have you been looking for Joe?
That's what Joe did for us.
That's why I feel so connected to him, to you.
It's true.
I've missed you, Emma.
You shouldn't stay on too long.
Tell him the meeting place.
Emma, who is that?
It's safe.
Come back to me, Joe.
New phone?
Nope.
Well, please know I'm smiling on the inside.
Do you understand these rights?
Luke, you'll take Emma to meet Joe.
I should go.
I'm better with Emma, and besides, who's gonna be more welcoming to Joe-- me or Luke?
He's more of a people person.
Can you help me?
I didn't mean to cut you so deeply in the subway.
Scars make us more interesting.
It's sexy, no?
You don't have to do this for us, Jana.
The apples will do just fine.
Jana, tell me about Corbin.
You're very quiet.
I'm okay.
Are you gonna kill Miss Jana?
You got what you came for, right?
Mandy... your mama was a threat to us, and that is why she had to die.
Now Miss Jana wants to help us.
She's our friend.
You do see the difference, don't you?
It can't be given indiscriminately, or it loses its value, and we lose the great privilege of offering it.
Your mama, she gave us no choice.
Here's what I have.
Um... there are several contacts, but I have no idea if they're still valid.
I'm here for you when you need anything.
It looks like she's gone.
Call me back.
Are we keeping you?
Mr. Hardy, what would you do if you were in my position?
Do I slap your wrist again, or do I bring the DA in here and officially book you?
Uh... the first one.
This new cult, this fan club of Joe Carroll's, seeks fame in the worst possible way.
Probably.
Have a nice day.
Director Franklin thinks you're more valuable if we follow you.
She's leaving town.
Not yet she's not.
I'm staring right at her.
Are you sure he's coming?
Please stop asking me that.
Is that him?
I'm almost there.
I'm almost there.
Then hurry.
I see her!
I'm a federal agent!
Roadblocks, aerial search spanning the Tristate Area.
Call them again.
You know the case I'm working on.
Our car broke down.
We gave one of the rooms away.
You'll have to share a room tonight.
Your new country.
Have you been throwing up?
Sure.
- Where were they seen last?
- At the edge of town.
- She's the last one who saw them.
- Model?
- But they were always home by bedtime.
A reputation for being easy.
Give me another ten.
Bad time to pick on the military.
What that fascist said is antidemocratic.
You can't criticize a general and expect a pat on the back.
The military still has power.
Look where it got you.
You'd rather extort money from hookers and bars.
- That's not enough for you?
A bottle of sweet wine and two glasses.
No, one.
Good night.
What are they drinking?
- Gin.
- And for you?
- Another beer.
I'd better not mix anymore.
- What time is it?
Anywhere.
Their father wasn't very happy with them.
Rocio.
Give these gentlemen some wine.
Say when.
When.
- For you?
- No, thank you.
- River crabs.
- Spicy?
May I?
Any idea where they may have gone?
Did you argue about anything?
Notice anything missing?
Do you know why your daughters wanted to leave?
My daughters didn't want to go anywhere.
Did anyone want to hurt them?
- Any money, anything valuable?
- Do you know why you're here?
- To find your daughters.
- No one gives a shit about them.
I found it in the brazier.
- Did you talk to them?
- They were far away.
- We were with them after that.
- Where?
At the bumper cars for a while, then we went home.
- What time was it?
- Midnight.
- I know because we had to go.
- Where did you leave them?
Is it true they wanted to leave town?
- Anywhere is better than this.
It's Quini.
- Her boyfriend is outside.
Can we go now?
You can leave.
He's been working there for two years.
- Can you tell me what you saw?
And the Dyane 6 has them built in.
It was more like this one.
The Dyane 6.
Angelita is psychic, she sees stuff.
She talks to the dead in her sleep.
She asks them what she wants to know and the dead tell her.
Have a seat.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing.
Pedro!
Over here!
What's up?
I'll get the car.
I'll see if I can reach it.
I'm almost touching the water.
Careful!
Are you okay?
I got it, pull me up!
Estrella was wearing hose like those.
Freeze!
Stop!
Why are you running?
- Roebuck.
- Where are you from?
- The town.
Get up.
- What's your name?
- Jesus.
You and I met the other night at the fair, remember?
My head still hurts from the gin.
- How did you get here?
- I walked.
- It's along walk.
- Not if you know the trails.
- How much do you get for Bambi?
- 250 pesetas a kilo.
Don't sell it, you owe us.
So find someone who knows how to cook it.
Son of a bitch!
Get out of here or I'll peg you in the head!
In the well?
Garbage.
Tie up the geese, I need to take a leak.
Abelardo!
Abelardo, come here!
Carmen.
Estrellla.
Go back to the oar, I forgot my notebook.
Then why are you putting it here?
I'll put it back if you want.
First degree burn on the left hand."
Let's move to the other body.
Write down that she has cuts across her neck, abdomen and thorax.
Three fingers cut off on her left hand.
Help me turn her over.
She was forced from behind too.
They have been in the water for two days.
- Where does this road lead?
- What are those photos for?
Weren't you listening?
Get the hell out of here!
I'm leaving, I'm leaving!
Go on.
Handle this discreetly and solve it as soon as possible.
I promise you'll be rewarded.
The harvest begins soon, and we can't lose it.
We already have enough problems with the strike.
Your ticket back to Madrid.
They weren't killed here, there's no blood.
Someone drove them here and dumped them.
The tire tracks double back.
He changed his mind and turned around.
Maybe he saw someone and got nervous.
Someone has to tell the parents.
You're from here, they know you.
I'll do it.
Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
What's wrong?
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
No, you guys aren't cops.
I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?
The Costa del Sol.
She found a job there.
She loved me.
Nobody commits suicide with a suitcase.
- What suitcase?
I don't know.
Late means late.
What do I do if there's no phone, paint one?
I'm working, don't start.
Good morning.
I'm sorry.
The girls' autopsy just came.
Estrella's pantyhose had semen on them.
Blood type AB.
When did you talk to him?
- Early.
- You never sleep?
When you do, that's why you never see me.
The forensic said it was a boat propeller.
Nobody in her family knew she was leaving town to work.
The girls had one just like it.
These places are hard to find.
Almost 500 pesetas.
- Five hundred.
- And the smokes.
For the ride.
Want me to open it?
Looks like they left in a hurry.
They left when they found out their daughter had drowned.
They couldn't set foot in the house after that.
You know them?
The one in the middle is Quini.
His mother disappeared three years ago.
I have something to show you.
Did you notice anything strange before she left?
- My granddaughter was very sad when Quini left her.
These books are hers.
She was going to night school to get her diploma.
- Can we take these?
- Please don't lose them.
Okay, okay!
You, stay put.
- Did you know Carmen and Estrella?
- A little young, no?
- Young for what?
- Did you take photos of her?
- Do I look like a photographer?
Want me to hit you again?
Where were you the night they disappeared?
With a friend.
Blonde, long hair, 16 years old?
- Is that how you like them?
- Motherfucker!
Stop, stop, stop!
Okay, okay.
Where were you?
You already know, I was with Marina the whole time.
How do you know her?
I don't.
- And this one?
Why are you in the photo?
Must have met her that night.
Can I go now?
Get out.
That's my knife.
Take it.
They're all the same age.
Very young.
In '77, '78 and '80.
- People drink more, it takes longer to notice someone missing, more people meet...
Boss.
Give her this and another round.
- It's strange.
Why does he do it?
I'm alone.
Just a moment.
What can you tell me about this?
- That she has nice tits.
- It's Carmen, she's dead.
She had nice tits.
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.
- Where did you get it?
- That's not your concern.
What do you want?
Something I don't know.
They were tortured.
Were they raped?
If you catch me younger, I make you a hero.
It's a very rare film.
I don't think many people around here use a roll like that.
I can find out who does.
Does your family know what you do?
My family thinks I'm the next Truman Capote.
Find out.
I've seen your partner too, but I don't remember where.
Do you know if he ever worked in Vallecas?
I'm sorry.
I found my daughters' bankbook.
My husband had it hidden in the car.
We found this in the glove compartment of your car.
What's going on, Rodrigo?
Pay who?
A loan shark.
Why?
Because I wanted to get my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters in this town anymore.
You borrowed money for your daughters?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Heroin.
You know what that is?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
They took the washing machine, the fridge, the television...
If I don't pay, they'll take the car and the boat.
We'll have to move away.
We have to find whoever owns that heroin.
I'll take the river.
I'll take Quini.
Yes.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Marina's at her house.
Her mother says she's fine.
The Civil Guard is mixed up in all of this.
Someone's tipping them off.
The whole town smokes American tobacco and there's not a single butt on any of the boats.
They have to get by on something between harvests.
Sit there.
- I'm fine standing.
- Sit, damn it.
What were you doing at the hunting lodge earlier?
Yes, I do.
Nobody ever explained it to you?
- Who's the man in the hat?
- What man?
The guy who went in after you, before I got my head bashed in.
You want my blood, is that it?
Call the doctor, I'll wait.
I remind you this is a democracy.
Next time you want to arrest someone, you ask me first.
This country isn't what it was.
The harvest is soon and people are nervous.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
I went to a movie.
With who?
- With some friends.
- What friends?
One moment, I'll be right back.
Who were you with yesterday at the hunting lodge?
Aren't you a little hot in that sweater?
I'm sick.
How did you hurt yourself?
My watch gives me a rash.
- I don't know who you mean.
- Where's Quini?
- Does your mom know what you do at the lodge?
- Honey, what's wrong?
Marina?
- What are you doing?
- Did you believe a word she said?
There are five bedrooms, each with several beds.
I have extra beds if there are more of you.
There's room outside for the dogs.
Do you know the area?
I was here yesterday and I saw three people enter the house.
Nice, very pretty.
I don't know who rents it.
You rent it and you don't know to who?
I rent it to him by the day.
He calls me right before and puts the money in an account.
Lower your voice.
Who's the man in the hat?
What are you doing?
Good afternoon.
- The watchman?
Never seen him in my life.
Take a stroll, Jesus.
Go inside.
Go on.
Have a seat.
Eugenio, give them something to drink, it's hot.
The heroin Rodrigo found was mine, but he didn't find it, he stole it.
But I didn't kill anyone.
What do you want?
Withdraw the Civil Guard from the Point.
Okay or not?
- Tell them, Fermin.
I saw the man who threw the bag in the well.
- What did he look like?
- I didn't see his face, it was too dark.
But he was normal, a normal person.
It was the same day the girls disappeared.
- What kind of car was it?
The car had a sticker on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair and a hat.
- A little shorter.
- What was the hat like?
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
- Anything else, Fermin?
- That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel where he worked in Malaga.
- Is he from around here?
Thank you.
Bye, buddy.
Goodbye.
We need to get them.
The photos of the girls were taken with a roll like that one.
Where are my photos?
- I don't have them yet.
- And what do you have?
Aguila Photography, in Seville.
Someone places a prepaid order every month.
- Who?
- A good-looking guy named Quino or Quini.
They develop them there too, but they wouldn't tell me about them.
But definitely not communion photos.
I think there's someone else there.
Tell me who he is and you'll get your photos.
Would you trust someone like you?
You have my word.
I remembered.
He was in the Social-Political Brigade.
You know, Franco's Gestapo.
He killed a girl at a protest in Vallecas in '71.
Shot her twice.
That's Marina.
She and my daughters were close friends.
Quini took her to the hunting lodge the other day.
After they were together he asked her not to get dressed, and he tied her to the bed.
Then he left the room and came back with another man.
Who was he?
She didn't see his face.
He took photographs of her.
Quini threatened to show them to everyone in town, if she told anyone.
Do you think she'd be able to tell a judge?
She couldn't even tell you.
I have to go.
What problem?
Something weird with a very young girl.
Rovira Galvez, Sebastian.
Sexual assault on a minor?
Whereabouts unknown...
Any friends who know him?
No, he has no family.
Nobody in his town ever saw him again.
He didn't even go to his mother's funeral.
You should know we're going through rough times.
Mr. Alfonso is offering 20% more than last year.
- 150 pesetas more per day.
Anyone who doesn't want to work can stay home.
Sir!
Excuse me.
Alfonso Corrales.
Yes, don't worry.
Of course.
Good night, Manuel, and thanks.
The field boss says there's no Dyane 6 on the Corrales property, neither registered or unregistered.
And Marina's mother says her daughter is at a movie.
I'll call Mr. Corrales tomorrow and have him come in for a blood test.
Right now I'm going to have them check on the girl.
And I also want authorization to question Corrales and Quini together.
I heard you were a troublemaker.
What did you say?
All you have is literature.
That's right.
I won't authorize anything until you bring me something conclusive.
You're protecting him.
What?
You're going to be a father.
You should be more careful about what you do.
Get out.
Why didn't you say anything?
You're just like the rest of them.
Be careful who you get your information from.
Let's go to Marina's house.
Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care.
- It's me.
Hi, Marina.
I wanted to know what's happening with Malaga.
When will they call me?
I have to get out of here.
It's okay.
- Who?
- The watchman.
- Where is Sebastian?
I said stop!
Sit down.
Do you know who Carmen and Estrella were?
Before they killed them, they tortured them.
With a hunting knife and pliers.
They stuck something in their ass and vagina until they bled.
They were awake the whole time.
You can't imagine how much pain a person can bear before fainting.
Look at me.
What's the watchman's name?
Sebastian.
He came looking for work and I hired him.
His mother was my friend.
I don't know.
He had changed a lot.
I hardly recognized him.
Have you ever seen him in this house?
I don't come here when the house is rented out.
Where is Sebastian?
Where?
At the abandoned house at the lodge.
Juan!
A contract in Estrella Blanco's name to work at the Hotel Medio Dia.
And there are more, with other girls' names.
There goes the car!
Come on!
Careful, it's slippery in the rain.
Careful!
There's a shortcut over here!
Freeze!
Who?
To congratulate me?
A telegram?
I can practically walk there.
How are you?
This is Macarena and...
My partner, Pedro.
We're celebrating because they got a raise.
They won the strike.
Long live the working class!
You want another drink?
Come on, my treat.
Let's have a drink.
Pedro, Pedro...
Where is it?
- Where have you got it?
Here, hold onto it.
For your son.
Don't lose it.
Don't lose it, Pedro.
You're a hero now.
Your photos.
To Truman Capote.
A gift.
They called him the Crow.
Take care, Pedro.
Jesus made us some food for the road.
Bambi stew.
We're good, right?
I know I said toasted, Scott.
If you cover it with a paper towel, it'll still be warm when I finish the cavity search.
Off you go.
Cough.
What could I possibly be trying to take out of prison?
Change into these.
Do you understand you will be subjected to a urinalysis upon your return and said test is your own financial responsibility?
Yes.
You may not purchase, sell, possess, use, consume, or administer any narcotic drugs, marijuana, alcohol, or intoxicants of any form or frequent places where such articles are unlawfully sold, dispensed, used, or given away.
Lady Gaga?
You wanna hear?
No, that... that's okay.
Is that your ride?
Pegged you more for a yuppie than a hippie.
See you in 48 hours, inmate.
Come inside the Green Machine!
Just can't believe she's dead.
If it makes you feel any better, you didn't miss much.
She just slept for a few days, and then the sleep stopped being temporary.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I told her for you.
She knew, Piper.
Ready?
Seat belts, please.
Next.
Three Mrs. Dash's Table Blend, four lemon juices, five adobo powders, and two onion powders.
Oh, that's none of your business.
You must have a pretty hefty fund, huh?
Those no-good sons finally doing the right thing?
Dmitri hit it big with a scratcher ticket?
Don't you dare talk about my family.
Maybe your little market turned around in spite of the economy and everything.
Let's keep the line moving, inmates.
It just warms my heart to see you finding your way in here, settling in with the AARP crowd.
Gardening looks like a comfortable little life.
Next.
I need a favor.
Well, that's gonna cost you.
What's your price?
Oatmeal pies.
The Little Debbie ones that leave that oily residue all over your hands, but are still somehow delicious.
Done.
I need you to bring all the girls to the greenhouse tomorrow... at dinnertime.
That'll run you two boxes.
And if you want my opinion, you're going about this all wrong.
This is going to be really special.
You know, another layer of icing on a shit cake doesn't make it taste good.
I don't understand what you...
Didn't your boyfriend teach you how to treat a staff member, Floppy Tits?
Shot!
What the hell is he doing here?
Why, yes, John, it's a beautiful morning.
Peaceful, even.
He endangers the inmates, and you know it, sir.
I mean, it can't even be legal to have him here, can it?
- Would you like to have a seat?
His suspension is up, so we're gonna have to deal with it.
And between you and me, some of the administration feel there's a job to do.
No one else is up to the task.
I'm up to the task.
I will.
Well, it was... suggested to me... by more than one person.
Maybe this was a bad idea.
Well, it's okay to be uncomfortable, Sam.
It's a feeling I would encourage you to embrace.
Embrace it?
I live it.
My whole life is uncomfortable.
All these women, criminals, bureaucratic idiots.
I don't even feel at home in my own home anymore.
And now I'm sitting in an office with some weird painting of frogs, which I'm guessing is supposed to be soothing.
Sam, I'm hearing a lot of stress.
Yeah, well, that doesn't even begin to cover it, okay?
Do you like your job?
I felt useful.
And what changed?
Hell if I know.
I got older.
Maybe I care less.
Maybe I've seen enough to know that I won't make a difference.
That it's all a waste.
You know... sometimes we get stuck seeing things from one perspective, but if we can just shift our perspective even a little bit, makes all the difference.
That's it?
That's your fancy, $75-an-hour advice?
Are you uncomfortable with the amount I charge?
I thought we just established that I'm uncomfortable with everything!
Are you always this quick to anger?
Are you always a condescending cunt?
Well, I think we have our work cut out for us.
My shoes feel tight.
But I'm saying this guy, Heinrich Dreser, deserves to be right up there on the bad-guy shelf.
Uh, heroin is the love of my life, she's my best girlfriend... she's my soul mate, 'cause, you know, she makes me feel better than anything.
So, in closing, uh... fuck the Germans.
Okay, that's it for today, kids.
Strength to accept what you cannot change, magical fairy dust, unicorns, etcetera.
How kind of you to remember.
Did you read this?
It's about kids with cancer.
I got enough depressing shit in my life.
I don't need it in my books, too.
Everybody needs a little bit of help with reality now and then.
The thing about reality... is it's still there waiting for you the next morning.
Oh, yeah.
I was first place Original Oratory two years running.
You know, until I got expelled for breaking my coach's toe.
You got my goods?
You got most of them already.
I'm a woman of my word.
And I'm a woman who gets paid on time in full.
Reznikov, you're out of bounds.
What did you call me?
Get back in bounds right now.
Since when do you care where I am?
That's a shot.
307, refusing to obey an order from a staff member.
He's your bulldog now?
He's off leash, and I don't want to get bitten, either.
I'll see you around.
Don't let me catch you anywhere near the kitchen again.
You know the drill.
Your commissary come through yet?
Haven't brushed my teeth since we came in yesterday.
I gotta take a leak.
You Parker?
Rhonda.
Brought you some stuff, a little welcome basket.
We'll see you at breakfast.
I don't eat breakfast.
It upsets my stomach.
Want some of this?
No, thank you.
Thank you.
Get some toothpaste, too.
You're very kind.
You got assigned a work detail yet?
Kitchen.
That's a plum gig.
Yes, feels like home.
My family, we own a small market, and I serve food there.
I use the same produce people that the kitchen here uses.
They knew to give me the good stuff.
They owed me.
Now they really owe me.
I told them Neptune is for seafood, not fruit.
You know a vendor?
Know them?
They're here because of me.
And I'm here because of them.
Breaking rules got me in here.
Yeah, well, I'm not telling you what to do, you know.
I'm just telling you how to survive.
Next.
It feels glamorous, but like, I'm still not a real smoker, you know?
- Got it.
- All right.
Fuck you.
I didn't wanna just walk right in.
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
No touching!
Too much, too fast can be a shock to the system.
Like when POWs finally get to eat, and then they eat too much and their stomachs explode?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hello, good to see you.
Oh, my God.
You never remember what home smells like until you've been gone for a while.
I remember that I always used to think about that when I got back from camp, that I was smelling what my friends smelled.
What's it like?
You.
Hey, is this all... is this all my stuff?
It's your stuff.
Why do I have so many clothes?
Larry, which one has all my pants in it?
Those are probably over at Polly's already.
Oh, how is she?
- Yeah.
Thanks, Bloomer.
Oh, it's fine.
No, it's not fine.
The one with the cow on its back and its legs were all up in the air?
Uh, under the cow it says, "I'm fine, really. "
What a stupid fuckin' pillow.
You, uh... you could stay here... if you want.
Well, lucky for you, it's in my furlough paperwork that I have to stay with my parents.
I don't know.
Okay, see, that's exactly how I do not wanna spend these next two days.
You know what we're gonna do?
Aren't you not supposed to drink?
Larry Abraham Bloom, I am free for the next 48 hours.
It's great to know that you're still a rule-breaking criminal at heart.
Thank you so much for coming.
She was great, yes.
No, she doesn't have another granddaughter.
It's called furlough.
It's temporary, yeah.
Forty-eight hours.
No, see?
No handcuffs.
How are you holding up, dear?
How much longer do you think this is gonna be?
Funeral's tomorrow at noon, so eat a good breakfast.
Everyone's very excited to visit with you.
So they can all stare at me like a lion in a zoo.
Been a difficult day for everyone, dear.
You know how Grandmother felt about them.
I'm not eating.
I will report you to the administration.
Take that, you tattletale.
I am staging a hunger strike in protest of the reprehensible conditions in this facility!
Can't believe you're wasting your time on lettuce.
I missed you, too, Pipes.
Oh, come on, Larry.
I don't think you're supposed to be drinking, honey.
I believe it's the Federal Department of Corrections in this case.
Fuck 'em.
The last thing anyone needs is you getting your sentence extended for some silly furlough violation.
Really, Dad?
Piper, can we not do this now, please?
My mother has died.
Celeste was so proud of you.
From the moment you were born.
It's hard to imagine that's true anymore.
Like what?
You're my little girl.
That woman in there, that's not who you are.
I'm in here, hello?
- Hey, hey, hey!
Fuck me.
Fuck, I slept with someone.
Please don't tell me anything else.
Yeah, well, it's much worse when you can imagine it in your own head.
I love you.
I love you, too.
You don't have to come to my grandmother's funeral tomorrow.
Oh, thank God.
You ain't gonna get a gold star for showin' up early.
That guard, that awful, awful man.
Which one?
Pornstache.
He's punishing me for believing in something.
Well, people don't like conviction around here.
Well, I'm gonna show them.
Soon, no one will be eating, and then they'll see.
Why ain't we eating?
In protest of the conditions in here.
Well, that's just super stupid.
And, yeah, I said "stupid" twice, only to emphasize how stupid that is.
Hey, leave Mulan alone.
You know, look around this place.
We're criminals, but that don't mean we don't deserve to be treated like normal people.
Exactly.
Since when do you care about the conditions, Leanne?
Since always.
Nobody likes to live like an animal.
So, you wanna join me?
It depends on what they're serving for lunch today, but I'll think on it.
She's Lilo, isn't she?
So, you're saying that I'm Stitch, you friendless freak?
We ain't ready for breakfast yet.
Didn't your mother teach you manners?
Why you old people always gotta be so cranky all the time?
Did you get caught up in your boyfriend's drug game?
You wanna know what I did?
Cut my husband's dick off with a butcher knife, and it wasn't even sharp.
I still dream about it, all the blood, the way it flopped around in my fist.
It's so disappointing being underestimated as you age.
So long, Rhonda.
Something major must've happened for her to be sent down to max, no?
Yeah, well, who knows how stuff works around here?
You hear Anita had a heart attack last night?
Just do it.
Pull.
Holy shit.
Not too bad for a white girl, hmm?
I don't wanna get in over my head.
Shit, you gonna be running things around here in a few months.
But I do thank you for your advice.
Hey, Vee, I'm sorry to bother you, but the one without the eyebrows, she ain't got her money.
Figured you'd wanna deal yourself like you told us.
I'll be right there.
I'm impressed, Red.
Red helped me with Mendez.
Does the entire prison know?
How can you act like everything is fine when he's back here?
And Mendez doesn't even try to talk to me.
Just feels a little weird since, you know, he's in love with me or whatever.
You would think that he'd try to say hi.
But that's a lie.
But didn't he have sex with you?
Are you actually defending him right now?
I just can't believe that you would send an innocent man to prison.
I mean, that's why you fucked him in the first place, was it not?
You know how scary my mom can be.
But I've had time to reflect, and he's innocent.
Well, I need time to think.
Don't you go doing nothing without talking to me.
You hear me?
Now, you want me to finish or what?
Man, you people are like a 3D "Don't do drugs" ad.
Ain't that the code?
Damn, you want that many?
Isn't that what it costs?
What are you talkin' about?
The stuff.
You can say, "cigarette. "
You saying we all look alike?
This one Christmas, I was allowed to help Grandmother make her really famous sugar cookies for the very first time.
I think most of you have probably received a tin of her cookies over the years.
If you didn't, Grandmother didn't like you.
I'm just sayin'.
Anyway, it took less than five minutes for me to mess up, and I poured too much baking soda into the dough and I immediately started crying.
I thought I had completely ruined Christmas.
And then she said to me, "Piper, life is made in the mistakes. "
All these steel plates that ting and sound like, I don't know, like, if an ocean were to suddenly make music.
Lot of ocean imagery here.
But look, the point is that Grandmother was a wonderful woman.
And my sister, Piper, is here, and that is truly incredible because she is technically a ward of the federal government.
Or... just returned from Africa, Aunt Kathy.
Today is a day to celebrate today.
And that is why... that is why I can't think of a better time to do this.
Friends, family...
Our friends are here, Piper's on furlough, our buddy, Sam, got ordained last week just for us.
Thank you, Sam.
P, ain't you bored of havin' the same damn conversation every day?
Shit, I know I am.
Yo, just listen, all right?
Why don't you listen and stop running your mouth?
She's been real good to me, and I am not about to turn away from that.
Vee is my family.
Thought I was your family.
You both are my family, yo, like...
What if we was...
What if we was drownin' in the middle of the ocean, and you could only save one of us?
'Cause there's not enough room in the boat.
It's, like, the world's tiniest boat or some shit?
It's like a little raft for kiddies and shit, all right?
- Can you just play the game with me?
- Listen up, pussy.
I love you, but I am done as a burnt burger talkin' about this shit.
No more talkin' about Vee to me or to anyone.
And, P, that woman don't play around.
Don't get in her way.
Yeah.
What happened, Doggett?
You know I get mad sometimes.
But I was really trying to turn a new leaf.
It is truly awful down there.
Doggett, have you always been quick to anger?
What you mean?
I mean, does it sit right below the surface?
Does it bubble up and surprise you when you're not expecting it?
Do you have a pounding right here?
Like, feels like a vein's gonna explode?
Yeah.
Are you a psychic or something?
No.
How are you in my head, then, right now?
Because I've had anger issues of my own... and what I've found is that a change of perspective can make all the difference.
Do you mean, like, looking left rather than right kind of thing?
Exactly like that.
What would we do?
Talk.
What will we talk about?
I could counsel you through some of these issues.
That's so awfully nice of you, Mr. Healy.
Maybe they're runnin' late.
Man, this took way more convincing than two boxes of oatmeal pies are worth.
You made this?
How the fuck you do this without a kitchen?
I'm a good improviser.
And I had some help from the baddest bitches around.
It smells wonderful, Red.
You're my family.
All of you are very important to me.
Now shut up and eat.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
You know, Red, we've done okay without you.
I know you have, but I want you to do better than okay.
Or burned.
Gina, I don't know that I'll ever have the words to express the regret I feel for what happened to you.
Okay.
I'm willing to make this more of a democracy, if that's what you all want.
I just want my family back.
My dear Norma, you've been by my side for many years.
You stood beside me, listened to me, plucked the hair out of that weird mole on the back of my arm.
You're my best friend, and I miss you so much.
Thank you for giving me another chance.
What about me?
Don't you have a special dedication for me?
Boo, thank you, for always being a pain in my ass.
Hear you have a pretty good system worked out for yourself in here.
Norma... get the nice young woman a form.
Write down what you want, and I'll do my best.
We're a little overwhelmed with orders lately, though.
It's not for sale, sorry.
You don't even wanna hear the offer?
Try me.
You get to stay in cozy minimum security.
Oh, and we don't break your ribs.
You, my dear, have chosen the one fight in here that can't be won.
Go run to your mommy, tell her Red needs to talk to her, then the adults will discuss this.
You know that's a real stupid move, right?
I mean, I'm happy to go get her for you.
Today has been kind of boring, anyhow.
They was really scary.
What is this?
You think you can just get away with this shit in here?
It's time for a good old-fashioned search, ladies.
Oh, what is this?
Illegal contraband?
You scared?
'Cause you fucking should be!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the very first time, the bride and the groom.
It's so wonderful that you could be here, Piper.
How are you doing?
We would be so heartbroken for our Julie if she were in your position.
You know what, we were just talking earlier about what a wonderful kid you were.
Always in the newspaper for something and always achieving.
We just want you to know, dear, we still see you as that person.
Can I help you?
What do you want, man?
How much would it be worth to you to find another route in?
Depends on where the route goes.
Oh, now, you know I can't give you information unless I know what I'm getting for it.
And I'm supposed to be interested in that?
I know how Red's importing contraband.
Interested in that?
'Cause I also know that the guards are hot on your trail.
So you're gonna need a new cover, right?
Yes, ma'am.
10%.
They're always obedient.
Who do you think gave the order, Red?
You're my friend.
I don't remember us exchanging woven bracelets.
Didn't I give you the idea in the first place?
Now all of a sudden, it's yours?
What did you do to Rhonda?
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna keep taking orders and filling them.
My girls will be distributing the goods and collecting the payments.
I'll tell Healy.
Oh, Red.
You do that, and I will make sure that you end up exactly like Rhonda.
You are not taking this from me.
Shit, it's not even my birthday.
When I said prove it, I meant it in a Coach Taylor kind of way.
Not a "terrify all the inmates, get yourself suspended" way.
I don't have time for any more headaches on top of everything else right now, Bennett.
Yes, and your personal crap belongs at home next to your tchotchkes.
What are you trying to tell me?
What?
Must've been Mendez.
Right in here.
Right this way, gentlemen.
Bring him right in here.
What happened to his face?
Ah, he looks healthy enough.
Bed rest and cold compress is my professional prescription.
Are you telling me how to do my job?
For the love of Christ, boss, why don't we take him to the Knick?
Because I don't want to be in debt to that crooked little shit Barrow.
How bad is it?
Not as bad as it might have been.
Well, I suppose we might as well get started.
Whoever the hell this is, go to hell.
Treatment comes with a free shave and a haircut!
Bring your friend back around!
If he lives.
I hate for you to see me this way.
Believe me, Mr. Mendieta, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
Does it cause you a great deal of pain?
It make it difficult to walk.
You can push it all you like, but it won't go back in.
I'm sorry to tell you, you're suffering from an irreducible indirect inguinal hernia.
A weakness in your peritoneum has made it possible for tissue to insinuate its way into your scrotal sac.
Using all your big words while I stand here half-naked.
MY apologies.
Why don't you get dressed and I'll explain what we have to do.
Mendieta.
Is that a Cuban name?
Yes, I come here after the war.
How do you make your living?
I roll cigars.
No, no, I'll save it for later.
And what happens to me if this surgery fails, too?
And now Mendieta will have one, too.
Right this way, gentlemen, please.
It's his brother-in-law, in fact.
Can you save the leg?
What kind of business have you got with Bunky Collier?
Can you save the leg or not?
Edwards, what brings you here so early in the morning?
Just trying to impress you, Dr. Thackery.
- Like hell he will.
- Who else is there?
You want me to save the personage or not?
Very well, gentlemen.
Knuckle dragger.
Excuse me?
I assume you've read Darwin.
You're certainly taking your damn time about it.
The doctors will begin shortly.
In the meantime, I thought we might discuss the matter of compensation for my services.
Fair enough?
Not fair at all, actually.
Five hundred barely covers a few months' interest.
We're understaffed this early in the morning.
I can assure you, Dr. Edwards will only be assisting in the surgery.
That black bastard better not get too familiar with my man if he don't want to find himself hanging from a lamppost.
One thing more.
How's his pulse?
Weak, but steady.
Vacuum.
Christ, the bullet is lodged in the tunica.
It's the only reason he hasn't already bled to death.
Do you really think we'll be able to save this leg?
We need to take the leg off now.
It's already showing signs of necrosis.
Can't get the broken bones to set.
Has anyone else experienced symptoms of typhoid since the boys fell ill?
Not that I know of, Miss Robertson.
Did the boys dine anywhere unusual lately?
How many toilets you got in this joint anyway?
You're welcome to count them.
Are all the staff here today?
All but three who were released last week.
We needed fewer staff at the summer home.
Which three were released?
Do you have their addresses?
If I do, they're in the household accounts.
Do you handle much raw food this time of year?
Some fruits and vegetables, of course.
Mrs. Cooke spent the night at the hospital with the boys and Mr. Cooke left word he was not to be disturbed.
That ain't up to him.
Don't think for a moment he doesn't.
It's all the tall buildings.
They capture the heat.
A pleasure, as always, Doctor.
How's our personage?
He's still bipedal.
I'll take the drain out in 24 hours.
If there's no pus within a week, he should make a complete recovery.
So he will walk again?
Oh, he'll be back to accommodating you at one of Collier's cathouses in no time at all.
Still got a few minutes.
Why don't you get cleaned up?
For what?
You haven't forgotten, have you?
The Edison people are making their presentation at noon.
It gives me great pleasure to present today the Edison X-ray photographic apparatus.
Evelyn, if you'll be so kind.
One places the photographic plate here while the patient's afflicted limb is then placed on top of that.
Those are actually the bones?
They are, specifically of a 35-year-old woman.
And here, where she fractured her second and third metacarpals.
Sewing machine, I believe.
And what does the future cost these days?
$3,000.
Are you insane?
We've just spent the past hour discussing cost-cutting measures.
And now you want to splurge on some sideshow attraction?
You think that saving money by not laundering staff uniforms and charging them for meals, as Mr. Barrow suggests, will suddenly bring back patients with money?
In less than a year, I guarantee that the X-ray will be the new standard in diagnosis.
For once, let us be ahead of the other hospitals.
The only way we're going to be able to afford this machine is if the heavens open up and rain gold down on us.
Short of that, we'll need to consider other options.
What other options?
Moving the Knick uptown to where all the money has gone.
The value of this building is only going down.
The neighborhood continues to be overrun by the poor and unwashed.
Who will be left to care for them?
We've given them more than their fair share.
Even the monsignor won't find it hard to argue that we've held our charitable hand out much too long.
It encourages irresponsibility and reckless use of valuable resources.
Now, I have a prime piece of grassland on 5th Avenue and 80th Street which...
How will moving to the middle of nowhere help except to shorten your commute to these meetings?
And how will living in a fantasy where bills don't need to be paid and expensive resources are tossed out to the impoverished like silver coins from a railroad man's carriage help either?
It's nice in here.
It is with you.
Montreal, a beach in Carolina.
Leave everyone behind.
I'd go anywhere you told me to.
I had the money, Junia.
I tried.
I try every day to get there.
But I've made some mistakes.
What sort of mistakes?
I took money from my employer.
I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.
Then it did.
So I took more money and I tried to get it back.
Then we had the drop of '98 and we all lost.
All except for Harriman and Vanderbilt and his ilk.
They always sail on through, rich as ever.
Do you even know what I'm talking about?
Not really.
Hello, Mr. Barrow.
Officer.
I come looking for a favor.
Well, in here, four bucks will get you any favor you want.
It's of a different nature.
I want to propose a little business with Mr. Collier and I need a proper introducing.
What makes you think I know this man Collier?
Well, I only go in there to get cigarillos for my wife.
That's very accommodating of them, making a 10-cent sale at 2:00 in the morning.
What'd you have in mind?
Freelancers who hook for no one.
I thought if I could convince a few of them to work for Mr. Collier, he protects them, gives them a good place like this to work and...
Give you some money for bringing them in.
It's good for everyone.
It's a service to the girls and to Mr. Collier.
I thought since we knew each other from Mr. Speight and other dealings at your hospital, you might be inclined.
And what would your boss, Big Bill Devery, think of your little scheme?
It's just I got more mouths to feed at home than he's willing to pay.
Can you do me this favor, Mr. Barrow?
Well, you see, Phinny, these things don't come free.
Well, what do you know?
Is that so?
I'll have to remember that, Harry.
Well, we shouldn't keep a paying customer waiting.
And here is the patient herself.
Say hello, Mrs. Sung.
Excuse me, Mr. Cleary.
Please, we change our minds and we must ask you please to leave.
What are you talking about, leave?
God, fucking Methodists.
Would you give over with the nun?
I'm just trying to ease her conscience a bit.
There, look, she's all docile and ready for you.
So, how shall we begin?
You'll be wanting her to strip naked, I suppose.
We'll begin with you leaving the premises at once.
Can't I watch?
Well, you can't object to me sitting in the kitchen.
All right, all right.
Where's Mr. Sung?
You're priceless, you know that?
You didn't think I was really gonna bend an elbow with the yellow menace, did you?
I didn't go through with it.
What the hell are you talking about, you didn't go through with it?
Fuck does that mean?
It means she could feel it kicking.
Stand me one of those.
Not a very auspicious start to our partnership.
I think you made the right choice frog-marching me out of there, though.
No reason both of us should go to Sing Sing if the guard were to catch you red-handed, so to speak.
Oh, you're a real gent, Cleary.
And let no man say otherwise.
Of course the law says that anyone caught aiding or abetting abortion shall be punished in like manner as the principal offender.
Made a study of the law, have you?
So should you, if this is to be your only livelihood after the hospital closes.
The Knick will have to do the same if it doesn't want to be shuttered.
And there's nothing you, nor I, nor even the great John W. Thackery can do about it, no matter the miracles he's had to perform in the operating theater.
And if the hospital moves uptown, will you go with it?
I'll go wherever the Church sends me.
Well, that's just peachy for you, Sister.
But I'll have you know, I'm a man what makes his own fate.
There's nothing stopping Tom Cleary from following the smart money, as you call it, anywhere it may lead, and that includes uptown.
Saddle of lamb à la Colbert.
Astonishing.
I had the great pleasure to sample this very dish only last week.
I believe it is Charles' specialty.
Ranhoefer.
The chef at Delmonico's.
I wouldn't know.
$3,000 for a single machine.
See?
They're already earning a fortune on the immaterial.
We'll discuss it over cigars.
Oh, I thought I might see you here tonight, Robertson.
You wouldn't find a Vanderbilt dead at that place.
It only attracts the riffraff.
You know, I'm sorry to intrude, but I wanted to thank you for arranging the luncheon next week with the governor.
And what have we here?
X-ray.
You can have the machine.
The hernial sac has been cut and the bowel is being reinserted into the peritoneum.
Dr. Edwards, how did a man like you ever get his hands on something as expensive as silver wire?
Pulse is strong and steady.
Another here with an emphasis on the stitching.
Boss, you ain't gonna believe this.
Good evening.
Roundsman Sears of the 19th Precinct, meet Bunky Collier.
What the fuck is this, Barrow?
Some kind of threat?
It's a business proposal.
I do business with coppers all the time.
The hell I need another one for?
Well, Roundsman Sears is particularly well situated to supply you with your stock in trade.
The 19th Precinct is in the Tenderloin, ain't it?
My boys can't walk down the sidewalk there, it's so crowded with whores.
What have you got that they don't have?
A uniform.
You see, every day I arrest pretty young girls who are down on their luck.
One look at a uniform alongside the threat of incarceration is all it requires for the tender young things to agree enthusiastically to any alternative I should happen to propose.
What does this mutt get out of the deal?
First of all, let me put your mind at ease.
I looked in on your brother-in-law this evening and the doctors assure me he will make a full recovery.
Don't think you're dipping your bucket into that well again.
I'll take a flat fee deducted from my debt for every girl that Phinny recruits.
Beginning with the two outside.
Two, you say?
What's your name?
Millicent.
I don't normally keep coons, but you have a nice figure.
If a customer asks, tell him you're an octoroon, understand?
What's your name?
So from now on, you're a redhead.
The cost of the dye to be deducted from your pay.
All right, girls, show me the goods.
You'll be provided with room and board on a weekly basis, which will also be deducted from your pay.
Twice a month you'll be examined by a lady doctor, who will see that you are not sick or pregnant.
Very nice.
Thank you.
My colleague Jimmy here will now test your level of enthusiasm.
Always a pleasure.
Neely, what are you doing here?
It's your mother.
Tell me what happened.
Tonight the pain intensified, so my father asked me to fetch you.
What the hell are you doing here?
I was called here to treat this lady.
Mother, you have a pain in your back?
I think it's probably just a cyst causing a blockage.
I'm going to pop it.
Well, something went.
Thank you, Doctor.
There's probably a little blood in the stream, but there's nothing to worry about.
Doctor.
- Is she gonna be all right?
She just needs a day or two of bed rest.
Her boy can look in on her.
Anyone who views her as a little girl does so at their own peril.
You haven't really answered my question.
You should be proud.
In 10 years, she could be running the whole hospital.
In 10 years, I expect to have a gaggle of grandchildren.
I hope she understands that when she's married, she'll have other responsibilities to her husband.
If you'd be willing to have it with her, I would be forever in your debt.
You're already in my debt.
Nicaragua.
- It's all the buildings.
How long have you been standing there?
I wanted to ask you, Nurse, if you've ever visited the Eden Musée before.
The dime museum on 23rd Street?
No, I haven't.
Well, they have a lovely winter garden that I feel like you would enjoy.
You can have an ice cream and listen to music.
I think I'd like the waxworks at the Chamber of Horrors.
Do you enjoy being frightened?
I think it's delicious, so long as it's not really happening.
Maybe we can go there one afternoon.
Dr. Chickering, I need you.
Since 8:00 this morning.
You're wasting time, Bertie.
Where's Gallinger?
Of course.
Listen to me.
Christiansen was brilliant, but he froze.
How long?
Seventy-two seconds.
I don't think anybody could have done it faster.
We did everything right.
Did you hear about the Gallingers?
Little Lillian's sick.
Her head's at an unusual angle and there's a slight swelling of the forehead.
We think it's meningitis.
How the hell was she exposed to that?
Everett had a patient with multiple rat bites.
Just another Tuesday at the Knick.
It's a beauty, isn't it?
It's called a Rambler.
First thing I did when I moved here, even before I found a place to stay, was to buy it.
Comes in five colors.
I like riding in the city.
Makes me feel like I'm part of it.
You looked free.
I quite envied you that.
Can you ride a bicycle?
Then, no, I can't.
Then let me teach you.
It's harder than it looks at first, but it's the easiest thing in the world.
Hence the saying, it's as easy as falling off a bicycle.
You're thinking too much.
A song?
You know, it would be nice if for just once in my life a lady wasn't disappointed to see me.
Climb in the back.
Is it much further?
We'll be there in no time.
I'd like to know exactly where it is we're going.
I'm not gonna say.
But it wouldn't matter.
I've had more than my fair share of your type needing my services.
With the amount of time you rich ladies spend making yourself pretty, it's no surprise someone wanted to put that to good use.
Men, they want what they want when they want it.
Then you all come to Cleary for the fix.
It's better.
This ain't the place for joking, Cleary.
It ain't no joke, I swear.
She's a paying customer like all the rest.
You don't want this rhinoceros doing it, do you?
We're friends, Harry.
You could have told me.
So could you.
But then neither of us could, could we?
Could have done without him in the middle of this.
Never wanted him there in the first place.
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
You'll be married soon.
You can tell anyone who can count to nine that it happened on your wedding night.
I'll be your midwife and vouch for the baby coming early.
At least talk to Phillip about it.
He may see things differently.
I'll get you through it as quick as I can, little daughter.
A tumor has amassed at the base of the skull which is the cause of the patient's terrible pain.
And now on to the tumor.
Surgical knife.
This is our surgical preparation room.
Good afternoon, doctors.
Curiously, I found our New York brethren much less willing than my previous ones in Chicago.
Well, I think that's changing, thanks to you.
My father and I recently sat in on the pulmonary abscess procedure you did on your last visit to New York Hospital.
Seems they've heard wonderful things from Dr. Zinberg's patron, Mr. Loeb, and wanted us to see for ourselves.
Well, you must remind me to send Mr. Habershorn a note.
Well, you'll be a hard act to follow, Dr. Thackery.
Your choice of leaving the skull open is... intriguing.
I've always been a believer in osteoplasty, but this contradicts that.
Well, time will tell if my contradiction is correct.
Well, naturally, there are foreseeable complications.
No, it's not.
Physicians and other disciplines believe the mind is not a place where sickness can fester, but I assure you it can.
Indeed, we must be aggressive if our patients are to improve.
Of course, Dr. Cotton.
Step in.
I'm grateful for you taking on my wife.
Whatever the cost, our families are willing to pay it.
Please.
Eleanor, you have a visitor.
Hello, sweetheart.
Eleanor, it's me, Everett.
What in the hell happened?
Who has gone mad.
Now, you must see this as a kindness.
Her teeth had to go.
I believe in this treatment so strongly that I have removed my own children's teeth as a preventative measure.
So this is common practice?
It is not generally accepted.
My colleagues thus far choose to remain in the Dark Ages, but I'm confident when my results come in, they'll soon adopt my technique.
Then it's been effective?
That's more than I expected from you, Herm.
But what I got in my pocket is less than I expected from you.
You missed a payment again.
I thought after the favor I did you at the hospital...
You don't miss a payment!
I made that clear, you dim fuck.
And then you come to my place and blow money on whores?
I just wanted to see my girl.
She's my girl.
They're all my girls!
And that was my money you spent to plug my girl.
Seen it kill a fellow once.
Your change purse seems to be holding its own, though, Herm.
I'm tacking on a grand for being late and doubling your rate for it being a repeated offense.
I'll get some ice.
Algie, you come to help your mama?
Oh, I'd only get in the way.
Thought I'd come by a little early for the lunch today.
Girl has the wedding jitters if you ask me.
No one can see in.
They can all see in.
It's done.
Was it terrible?
It was our child.
You understand?
I think we made a mistake.
Yes, our affair was the mistake.
You never have wanted to be realistic.
Please convey my regrets.
In front of you is a man, age 32, suffering from splenic anemia.
Now this is evident in the slight green coloration of the skin.
This disease is rare, insidious, and up until now prognosis was anything but hopeful.
Unfortunately, gentlemen, it is only too true that the entire subject of blood making and blood breaking is as yet very imperfectly understood.
I thought you were at lunch at the Robertsons'.
This seemed more interesting.
Where are the atomizers?
He doesn't use them.
He says they're as modern as dinosaurs.
I am now going to separate the spleen from the splenic artery.
Suction.
More clamps, if you please.
We are through.
The patient still has a long road of convalescing ahead of him.
And we have a long road ahead of us in fully understanding this disease and how our blood behaves.
However, we may not be as far off as we once believed.
The question is why do transfusions fail?
And that is where we'll start unlocking the mystery.
For the purpose of beating Zinberg and not allowing him to bask in another triumph.
He then arrives at our theater acting all innocent when it is clear that his only intention is to spy and to steal.
There is a difference between wishing to learn and collaborate and looking to steal another man's work.
Zinberg is a thief!
He's a fake.
From now on, this will be my main focus.
Beginning today, Dr. Edwards, you will take the lead in all surgeries while I concentrate on this.
Until we win one of those new Nobel Prizes.
You much of a bleeder?
What he's doing, how far along he is in his research.
How?
Well, he's a man who believes in sharing.
Test that theory.
The one they brought in here after you saved his life.
I want him to kill Bunky Collier for me.
What are you talking about?
You have to ask him for me.
I have no choice.
And you want me to ask a favor of Ping Wu?
You're talking about bargaining with the devil, Herman.
You know, Wu is not a man to get involved with.
Ivory?
Yes, it's carved from the tusk of the elephant Frederick shot on safari last year.
Perfectly exquisite.
Oh, they're stunning.
Thank you.
Use them well.
I will.
What is going on here?
He attacked me!
Dr. Gallinger, you are suspended from service until you straighten yourself out.
And if you had to make that choice again, would I still be it?
I didn't think so.
Go home to what?
Don't you look antiseptic.
Perhaps you can complete your task by sneezing into my patient.
Earlier, you spoke of the coagulation problem in transfusion.
Now it's been accepted into fact that normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate.
You are conversing with me about your experiments now?
How much more evidence of your absurd behavior do you need?
I am on to something that cannot wait.
So normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate, but if you administer citric acid, then that time increases.
That could mean that each individual has varying levels of citric acid in their blood which we have yet to discover.
Silk suture, please.
I want blood samples from everyone on the ward.
I'm glad you contacted me, Dr. Chickering.
Well, my father's been after me about it for a while now.
Well, he only wants a good situation for you.
And I have that with Thackery.
Yet here you sit.
I won't take a pupil from his mentor, despite your father's request that I do so.
Well, he doesn't quite understand.
Dr. Thackery must be a good man and an excellent influence for you to have such loyalty.
We could have been excellent partners.
I don't think Thackery believed you were being sincere.
Of course.
The final hurdle is proving harder to negotiate than we imagined.
What's this?
Call it a show of good faith.
I'm not concerned with who figures it out as long as it gets solved.
Why did Thackery not come?
Why did he send you?
Do you mind if we speak alone?
This is not an average request.
What does he want?
To have you make good on your debt to him for saving your life.
He owes a great deal of money to Bunky Collier.
He wants Collier dead.
He said that?
His words?
Are you sure that's what he wants?
Very.
Let me take you home.
Would you fetch me some of my medicine, please?
What?
I don't like what it's doing to you.
I don't care what you like.
You see what it's doing to him?
I do.
It's much worse.
Excuse me.
Neely, I told him.
I told Phillip if he presented San Francisco as a fait accompli, you would feel the way you're feeling now.
- What are you going to do?
How are you?
How's San Francisco?
When I arrived in San Francisco, things were a mess.
I spent most of the last year trying to renegotiate some of the deals he made.
They would have proved fatal to the company if I hadn't.
If that's true, it makes me sad.
Me, too.
Couldn't sleep.
After you, sir.
Everything you could ever want.
You get pianos, headstones, ovens.
- You looking for anything?
Why on Earth would I want a rifle?
Bears.
Pet shop man lost his out of his front yard in Brooklyn last week.
Attacked a granny and the postman before they took it down.
Thank you for your kindly offer, but I'll be fine.
Can you picture me piloting one of them around the city?
Imagine all the escaped bears you could find.
We are all blessed to know her this fine day.
I did.
- You have information for me?
See, I at first thought the answer lay in the blood's coagulability, but Dr. Edwards showed me the error of my thinking.
Come, take a look.
Okay, this one is 60%.
Zinberg was wrong.
Honestly, no.
It's there, damn it.
I know it's a Sunday, but that's no reason to leave your brain in bed.
I doubt even the great Zinberg will have reached that conclusion.
Has he?
So we have won.
I think he's quite sincere in his pledge to collaborate, and if you would just be willing to share...
He's got, you know, people, spies everywhere.
Maybe you're one of them.
Thack, I am no such thing.
And I think you need rest.
All right, you can go.
Did he enlist you in this?
I volunteered.
Can you still do what I asked?
It's all arranged.
She's perfect.
Her anemic condition was brought about by chlorosis.
Maybe we shouldn't interfere.
A transfusion of blood may be just what's needed.
When you wake up, you'll be cured.
Nurse Elkins.
Blood is flowing.
Pulse is rapid.
Pulse is erratic.
Pulse is weakening.
- What's happening?
- It's not working.
I have no pulse.
What have I done?
It's Dr. Thackery.
You think I know what to do with this madness?
Please, Bertie.
Thank you.
Sit him up, please.
How much cocaine have you injected today, doctor?
Twelve grams.
That's quite a tolerance.
You've seen people in his condition before?
In my practice, more than a bit these days.
Women of a certain breeding who have become dependent on the drug.
Can you help him?
In the meantime, keep him comfortable.
Your man is no more.
He wasn't my man, Mr. Ping.
He was causing Thackery the trouble, remember?
I've known Thackery a long time.
He loves my woman, my opium.
He always pays.
But you...
Where did you get that?
From Collier's desk.
A man who owes me $9,000 as long as you owe Collier would be fed to my pigs.
That book is not...
I can read left to right, not just up and down.
This my book now.
What did you just say?
I read Zinberg's papers.
Certain people have one type, others another.
You were off by a mile.
Would you empty your pockets, please?
Is there someone you would like to list as the next of kin?
There's nothing you can do for him now.
There's no use in sitting there worrying about him.
Perhaps you could advance us the drugs and we could pay you once we've charged the patients.
Your patients can't pay.
Why would they advance us anything?
But there is a solution.
The decision has to be made now.
All in favor of shuttering this place and moving the Knick uptown?
Then... it's decided.
Welcome to Cromartie Hospital.
I'm Dr. Hackett.
When Dr. Chickering Sr. Called ahead on your behalf, he asked that you be registered under an alias to protect your privacy.
Is there a name that you prefer?
Crutchfield.
You have been steered to the right place.
As our reputation has grown, we've begun to specialize in treating cocaine madness.
The withdrawal of the drug from your system will be the hardest part.
Well, from the looks of you, you've done enough damage to yourself already.
We here at Cromartie Hospital believe that the pain of detoxification is counterproductive to restoring your health.
Rest assured, these treatments will only be for the first month or two.
Time to start getting better.
The Chickering residence.
He's asleep.
Do you realize the hour, sir?
Hold the wire.
Yes, what is it?
Yes, Dr. Thackery.
I'll be right there.
And what did your esteemed chief want so urgently?
It's just some experiments.
What kind of experiment can't wait until the sun comes up?
Introductions... this is Lin-Lin and this wonderful creature is Delores.
There's no chance in hell that's her real name, but it seems to suit her.
Now, I once met a Thai girl in the profession, swore her name was Colette Bonaparte.
How long have you been working in here?
What day is it?
Strictly speaking, it's Monday morning.
Two days.
All weekend without a break?
We took a few small breaks.
Doctor, I think you need some sleep.
So scrub in, Bertie the Wise, for I have many new secrets to reveal to you.
Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things.
So what did Christiansen do wrong?
Besides blow his brains out.
He believed that the one variable he needed to change was him getting faster, but there was a second variable he never even considered.
Come on, Bertie, you've got to think bigger.
What else could have changed about the surgery?
You know, it is such a shame that your father doesn't share your sort of curiosity.
That man seems to practice medicine in 1885.
But how could that be accomplished, the patient dying more slowly?
Right, but, okay, short of crawling up in there, I'm not sure that could be done.
Lord knows we've all wanted to try that at one time or another.
But in this case, we're just gonna have to rely on pneumatics to do the job for us.
What is that?
This is something that I invented yesterday... or the day before.
It's a sheath that allows the bladder to keep its correct shape for insertion.
You know, if a penis can make the trip one way and a baby the other...
We then add a weight to the tube so that it puts pressure on the wound, slowing the bleeding, giving ourselves more time.
That's why we're gonna spend the rest of the night in here inserting these into our lady friends and testing all variables.
She looks better this morning, more robust.
That's a healthy pink.
She's not responding to light or sound.
Her fontanel's protruding further, telling us she's got enormous brain swelling, and it's increasing.
She's going to get better.
There's really almost nothing...
You brought this into our house.
You admitted so yourself.
You have to fix this.
Do something for her, Everett.
What is it, Everett?
Venesection.
What is that?
I'll take any chance.
So long.
Thank you, ladies.
You've been such a great help.
You know, I think I need to make a few small modifications to the sheath.
I'm gonna have Sister Harriet put out requests at the other hospitals.
Any chance we can give them is better than what they're facing now.
Brilliant.
Bertie, fine work today.
You're making great progress.
Near as we can tell, the typhoid started at Elihu Brown's house eight months ago and moved to the Cooke house on 5th a month later.
You saw the look on her face, Jacob.
Cavorting was the least those two were doing.
How's the young girl doing?
There have been complications and another surgery, but the disease seems to have run its course.
And the woman who prepared it for every one of those people who got sick...
Well, families often hire part-time cooks for a week here or there and then on to the employ of some other home or restaurant.
In this case, to infect more people.
She must be a filthy thing and sick as a cod in a cesspool.
Believe me, no mistress would hire her if she looked the least bit ill.
Mrs. Grover's for the new money and Bigsby's for the old.
If she's working for the wealthy in New York City, she's been through at least one of those doors.
Then we're gonna have to go through them, too.
Where are you, Typhoid Mary?
Where did you say this machine was originally?
Seem to be some nicks and dents.
Well, that's to be expected from a secondhand piece.
If you don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself.
Never had an X-ray made.
My head.
Good.
Now, the trick is to stay as still as possible for the best results.
There.
This should take about an hour.
My condolences, ma'am, sir.
This looks like a very solitary way to spend your lunch.
We think we may have found the source.
Every woman's dream.
You think Phillip will understand?
A gentleman knows when he's been bested and must step aside.
How's my mother feeling?
Well, she's fine.
In fact, she looks better than you.
Are you sleeping at all?
You know all about stamina.
All those contests you, Henry and I used to have.
I think you're tougher than you think you are.
Dedicating yourself to the Knick is no ladies' tea party.
Perhaps.
I should be going.
I feel like I'm looking into my soul.
Let's talk about your price.
But it is not new, which is precisely why I called on you.
The hospital has limited funds.
Well, I could give it to you for 2,500.
I was thinking more in the range of 1,500.
It's not just the machine.
Well... it is still more than I had hoped.
But we've gone long enough without one.
So... 2,000 it is, Mr. Luff.
Wonderful.
- How does it work?
- Allow me.
All right, closer.
All right, here we go.
So it's rest and healing for several weeks until the flap fully attaches.
And no vigorous movement.
Sadly, I haven't had occasion for vigorous movement in quite some time.
So, I'll see you back here soon and we'll finish the job.
Let's get you a cab.
I prefer to walk.
Well, it was looking like rain.
It always looks like rain if you only look at the clouds.
Don't look at the clouds so much, John.
So you will let me know if you receive a previa case?
So what will you be attempting to sell me today?
I have all the surgical supplies I need.
I was actually hoping to interest you in doing a little selling of your own.
Who are the new heroes in America?
No longer.
People now believe passionately in the men who will bring them miracles... doctors, inventors, architects.
Technology and innovation will be the world's salvation and the people know it.
And you mean to exploit that faith.
No, I mean to give them the solutions that they're looking for.
And with your help, we think we can be.
You want me to invent medicines for you?
That's not my field of expertise.
Rub it on your trouble spots thrice daily, your malady will disappear.
Look, that's your picture right there.
Dr. Thackery's Rejuvenation Liniment treats rheumatism, neuralgia, sciatica, crippled back, lumbago, contracted muscles, toothaches, sprains, kidney pain, liver troubles, heart lameness, leg swellings, and cataracts.
Is that all?
Those are very real claims.
Well, then perhaps you won't mind telling me the ingredients that make up this miracle potion.
Let's not be coy with each other, Doctor.
Until hell freezes over.
In the meantime, would you be so kind as to stick your head firmly up your ass?
You've been counting?
Well, the place did get a bit rosier when you arrived.
Do you say that to all the new nurses?
No, of course not.
I was only teasing.
I know you wouldn't do that.
Because I wouldn't.
My mother says the first time you meet someone, in that moment, you can know their soul.
I wish I knew that when we first met.
Don't go getting full of yourself.
I also remember the first time I saw Mr. Pouncey and he was picking at his ear with a twig.
I'm not sure it's true you can know someone from the first moment, but maybe you can get to know them from some other moment.
Even the hardest people can surprise you.
That's where Dr. Thackery lives.
I know.
It's nicer inside than you might think.
Have you been inside?
He had me inside while he readied himself.
That was quite a day.
It certainly was.
I tried to explain it to my father and he just scoffs.
He wants me to join his practice at Columbia.
But why would I do that when I could be watching the man invent the future right in front of me?
It means a lot to me that you understand.
I do.
I just realized I don't even like pretzels.
Best not fix on going toe-to-toe with the Big Nig.
He ain't no free swinger a fella your size can get inside and surprise.
The Big Nig will kill a man like you in that alley and never break a sweat.
What?
My deepest sympathies to you both.
Thank you, Sister.
I can only imagine the tremendous pain in your hearts right now.
God knows your suffering.
I hope you know He's here with you.
She's going to get better.
Who, dear?
Of course.
Dr. Gallinger, may I have a word with you for a moment?
Of course.
She won't accept it.
She even prepared breakfast for Lillian this morning.
It's not uncommon.
Perhaps there might be a solution to help ease your loss.
What is it?
Recently a very young baby, a girl, was found on the doorstep of the orphanage.
I understand my impertinence, but I've seen many a grieving mother.
Death takes not only the soul of the child, but can destroy the souls of those left behind.
If Eleanor can hold a baby, nurture it, you can begin to find your way again to heal.
All I ask is that you consider it.
What are you doing here?
We have business to tend to.
- May I help you?
- Inspector Speight, Department of Health.
- Oh, I don't know any of the help by name.
Of course not, but we'd like to come in ourselves and meet your staff.
Inspector Speight of the Health Department.
What's your business?
We believe, Miss Mallon, that you may have infected those families and others with typhoid fever.
Typhoid?
The one thing they got in common: your filthy mitts.
Now, we need you to come with us to the Knick and give us your urine, saliva, and feces for testing.
I ain't going anywhere with you people.
I'm working and these boys need to eat.
Let's make this easy for all of us.
Get the fuck off of me for fuck's sake!
I never seen a society girl join the fracas that quick.
A teaspoon every four hours.
If she develops any pain in her lower region, have her douche with creolin solution.
I'll make sure and check on her in the next few days.
Bless you.
I don't know what we would do.
That'll be $8 for today, ma'am.
I can look forward to a poor night of rest again.
Perhaps you need a fella by your side.
Stay out of that habit for an hour or two longer, you shall have no delay in finding him.
All right, Harry, what's behind the sleeping trouble?
Half of the time I lay in bed convincing myself that what I'm doing is right by everyone.
Like that girl up there just now, her floor boss forcing himself on her.
I'm guessing it's the other half of the time that's the trouble.
St. Joseph's Orphan Home in Enniskean.
What's that say?
It's chicken scratch.
Compliments of Sister Clarice.
Taught me left-handed were wicked, sinister-like.
She'd whack me, giving it out till I puked myself.
A couple of years of that will turn you against them evil goats, God, the whole thing.
Except for the abortions and all.
And I know you ain't them.
I don't know much, but I would wager that God will put you far ahead of Sister Clarice when it comes to passing through the pearly gates.
How long have you been bleeding?
On and off for the last few months.
Is there a problem?
Your lower uterine wall has thickened.
And that, I'm afraid, is your placenta out of place.
Ready?
Equipment is aseptic and ready for use.
Are you sure we're ready?
Having doubts?
It's to be expected.
Not from me.
How can you be so certain?
Perhaps a few more trials with the... female subjects.
I could help pay for their time.
What you choose to do with them on your own time is entirely up to you.
Dr. Chickering is now inserting the deflated bladder, which is sheathed to keep the shape small while entering the vaginal canal.
Retractors.
The baby is alive.
The patient will live to mother it.
Almost.
I left some of my notes in the lab.
- Should I fetch them?
Have breakfast with your father and tell him all about how you'll soon be a published surgeon.
What the hell is this?
- What are you doing here?
This way.
The unbelievable brass on you to think you can run a clinic for Negroes in my hospital like some goddamn Underground Railroad.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
These people needed help and I needed to do it.
This goes beyond disobedience into outright negligence.
I hope you don't believe that your association with the Robertsons will save you from termination.
What was I supposed to do?
Morality from a man whose own morality allows sick and desperate people to be turned away because he believes them to be less human than he.
Edwards, you are finished.
What is this?
It's for suctioning.
Did you invent this?
Modified it from an existing product.
That's not the only thing I've come up with down here.
My solution for the inguinal hernia.
I then separate the cord from the sac and continue for one-half inch around the inside of the interior ring.
And what happens if you find that the hernia is congenital?
Where'd you find silver suture?
Another item I had modified.
How many hernia patients have you seen?
They're not hard to find considering most of the jobs colored folks can get involve heavy lifting.
Where'd you get the camera?
I bought it, like most of what you see down here.
You endangered your entire career with this stunt.
Right, because you were so charitable when you discovered me.
You know, this is good.
This is better than good.
So where do we go from here?
Well, all of this ends.
But not until these people are fully recovered.
And until then, I should be able to treat my other patients as well.
You just make sure you keep that door locked so that no one else stumbles in here.
What about my findings?
Well, I think we'll be making that the new standard hernia procedure.
Well, if it's the standard here, shouldn't it be the standard everywhere?
Meaning you want this to be published?
Oh, I could never get published in this country on my own.
But if I had a co-author...
Oh, you want me to co-author with you on this?
I don't want you just to get me when you can't find someone else.
Cards.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Is that true, Mr. Showalter?
Is that an incentive for me to keep losing to you?
Just look at me as a conveyer of your wealth to my future daughter-in-law.
If you don't mind, I'd prefer to cut out the middleman for the next few hands.
Oh, Cornelia's been playing a bit of detective alongside a health inspector.
You think she can be bought as easily?
It was exciting, Phillip, to get out into the street and do some good.
What's wonderful is to see such a flush in your cheeks.
Congratulations, Neely.
My wife will always have the best stories to tell her lady friends at lunch.
Well, thank you all.
It's been a long day.
Phillip, it's to you.
Come in, Gertrude.
My dress is ready to be hung.
Mr. Showalter?
Dear, I've known you since you were born.
You're going to be my daughter.
Why don't you start calling me Dad?
I don't think your own father would mind too terribly much, do you?
We lost two in childbirth.
I'm sorry.
But now I have one of my very own.
I suppose that's true.
Phillip has given us a beautiful, beautiful daughter in you.
I've invested a tremendous amount of money with your father.
I believe in the union of our two families.
I know he's grateful...
I don't want his gratitude.
I did it because I believe our coming together is a wonderful thing that will provide rewards and pleasures for all of us.
Do you think it's a wonderful thing, Neely?
Of course, Mr. Showalter.
Dad.
Open or closed?
What?
The door... open or closed?
Closed.
Sleep tight.
I'm not here for that.
Well, what are you skulking around at this hour for, huh?
Point taken.
You take care of yourself too, OK?
Lock your door.
Motherfucker.
Five minutes, maybe... stopping, no.
The guy from the other dream, his name was Robert Dexter.
Fascinating.
Look, I got my own shit to deal with, and so do you, seeing how you were just at my house whining about your mom.
Listen, if you don't give a shit, then why are you here?
Look, I had a fucked-up nightmare about something really bad happening near mobile homes and railroad tracks.
I just want this shit out of my head.
You didn't dream about the sign?
I just don't feel right about running off and abandoning these people.
- You're so good at it, though.
I was ready to move in, get a job, be a father to her kid!
What happened?
Looks like a murder-suicide.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
What the hell are you doing?
- Turning against the moon.
Come on, that was two days ago.
And you've been a dick ever since.
Remember when you were 11, you drew on one of Nicolae's grimoires and he was so pissed he punched you?
Yeah, it's hard to forget since he broke my nose.
- He was just drunk.
- He wasn't drunk.
He turned on the luna rea one too many times.
Every time, it gets harder to turn back.
Your body and your mind don't know what phase they're in.
You fall apart mentally and physically.
Well, there's not a lot I can do about it now.
You can promise that you won't turn on a bad moon again.
We'll see.
Cheers.
Your message last night, it was... so sweet of you.
I had an idea about your, uh, living arrangements.
You've got to leave this place, Olivia.
He's helping me get well.
And I'm supposed to listen to the man who despises Pryce?
You're supposed to listen to the man who's also a doctor.
You're not an invalid.
You're not weak.
You're a beautiful, powerful woman.
Hey, kid.
I hired an assistant to keep out guys like you.
Tell HR to go a little huskier next time.
How much cheaper?
Oh, yes, that is such a relief.
- Sorry, what'd you say?
- Just one sec.
That is what you really need.
You ought to give up this, uh, monk thing.
It's like an hour's drive.
Not like I've got anything better to do.
And the butler here is giving me the creeps.
You're my role model, Andreas.
Holding 300 patents, Godfrey Industries has revolutionized long-distance, even trans-global, surgery.
A Godfrey-Industries-trained surgeon in Pennsylvania performed a laparoscopic stomach surgery on a 35-year-old male in Dublin, Ireland.
The surgeon controlled the incisions by operating an external console.
- What can I do?
- What else?
- Um... th... that video, um...
I watched it.
I want the walkthrough of Pryce's lab.
I'll try his office again.
Element of surprise.
So, is this the first time a customer has ever asked for a ride along?
Yeah, but it's great, 'cause I'm making her pay for lunch.
So, uh, what have you been up to?
Just, oh, sitting around in that house.
You've been hanging out with Roman?
Meaning?
Why are you so interested in him?
I'm not.
Then why are you so not interested in him?
I was just making conversation.
Did you two date the same girl?
Or... each other?
We... were friends, and we had a falling out.
Over what?
Please press 1 to accept the charges.
Just... just give me a sec, OK?
What?
Yeah, and she's the best lawyer in the state.
Wherever you are, I'm with you.
I miss you.
I love you.
Everything OK?
Yeah, it's just some bullshit I had to deal with.
Symphony 39 in E flat.
Written in the summer of 1788, along with No. 40 in G minor and No. 41 in C major.
Took Mozart three months to write one major masterpiece and two minor ones.
I've known Roman all his life.
He is a clinical psychopath.
I'm not gonna take out some kid just on your say-so, especially when you and your order got your own agenda.
What's your deal with the White Tower, anyway?
Why does the Order of the Dragon want to own half of a genetics company?
God is diversifying his portfolio.
I'm going to find and kill... sorry, deal with... whoever's responsible, only when I know for sure.
And when you walk out that door, you lose my protection... both financial... and otherwise.
Are you OK?
That shit was outlaw, yo.
Who knew gypsies could be chemists?
Name me a gypsy chemist, Dom.
No doubt, no doubt.
Dude, shut the fuck up for a second.
You feeling anything?
Does a body good.
- Uh, how do you know my work?
- We are...
See that you do.
I obviously have a lot of anger, but I'm trying to let it go, because it's toxic.
Truth is, Norman and I should have broken up years ago.
It's the right thing to do.
Norman left me for you.
If I had wanted Norman to leave you earlier, trust me, he would have.
Go home, Marie.
Or what?
I already lost everything...
my marriage, my child.
What are you gonna do to me?
I have dead daughters too.
Maybe that's all I have, are memories of my dead daughter.
But what do you have, Olivia?
A boyfriend who's gonna leave you when he realizes what a terrible person you are.
A dead daughter of your own... a sweet girl who always loved you, but you treated her like a freak.
And a disturbed son who hates your fucking guts.
And if no one else has anything else to add, then I' happy to say we're finishing up early for once.
Time machine?
Sidebar.
You're flailing.
If you came up with the votes to get rid of me, I would walk out with the entire research department.
All you'd own is 50% of an empty building in a bullshit town.
Bitchin' loft space.
You sure you want to talk about locked doors?
Hidden rooms with their secret contents?
And this from a man who literally lives in a glass house.
You might want to remember who signed the baby's death certificate.
Now, I'm no lawyer, but that sounds kind of malpractice-y, no?
A not-so-gray area as to its legality.
See you at the proxy fights.
Oh, fuck him!
We'll own him once he realizes how much he needs us.
I was begging in slurred words for her not to kill me.
You and I both have our reasons to keep peace with Olivia.
I am trying the leash.
Some dogs need to be put down.
I have a new project.
I like new.
Research tool.
An enzyme inhibitor to knock out clotting factor nine.
As soon as possible, and off the books.
The effect of this drug on an organism would be to induce acute hemophilia.
Like an atom bomb going off in the bloodstream.
I brought you here because of your hematology expertise.
I am just questioning its application.
Then stop questioning.
Makes life so much easier.
I need it by the end of the week.
Research tool.
Who's Lynda?
It's my mom.
Is she OK?
She's in jail.
What for?
All those years on the road, she did some things that weren't so smart.
But I did too, so...
She doesn't deserve this.
I'm gonna get her out.
Well, it sounds like you're doing everything you can.
You know what we should do when we get back?
What?
What?
Oh, wait, you weren't kidding.
What?
So?
Oh, I wasn't lying.
This isn't some sort of "get the girl back to my place" thing.
Peter, do you really think I came here for a tarot reading?
It doesn't mean anything.
I love this mattress.
My ex had this stupid futon.
It felt like it had dead cats in it.
It's fine.
That bad, huh?
She died.
Oh, God.
I want you to stay.
- Nice try, but no.
You live here, ma'am?
Is everything all right, officer?
It's not illegal to be a fierce and ravishing warrior goddess.
I was born this way, you motherfucking bitches!
You don't find him weird?
Weirder than our last sheriff?
The guy who lost his mind and blew himself up with a bomb he was building in his basement?
I'm just saying, he's making us look bad, staying so late all the time.
I mean, what's he doing in there, anyway?
Uh, the white mask from the dreams.
Yeah, but he's making them look like accidents.
Why?
All of last year, Destiny kept telling me to pay attention to the dreams, and I didn't.
That's why everything went bad.
Well, if you're trying to make up for skipping out on me like a coward, then duly noted.
I was a coward.
You were my only friend.
And I shouldn't have abandoned you, and I'm sorry.
Good luck.
I got you a drink.
Let me.
The things on your hands are dirty.
I can make new ones out of Mom's t-shirt.
I can help.
Look.
I like it anyway.
I named my toe.
We could name your fingers.
This one is Gooey.
These two are Squishy.
You can't text me to drop everything, have me rush over, and then ignore me!
I'm not doing it anymore, not after everything that I have been through!
Baby, what's wrong?
Don't cry.
I'm planning something special.
No rush, no pressure.
I got these open tickets to Buzios.
It's this town in Brazil.
The most beautiful beach in the world.
Well, you know, Marie, she was never much of a traveler.
I've got to pee.
Since I was 15, I haven't eaten anything with a face.
- So...
- ... has been bothering me.
Not the baby per se, more like the entire situation.
I mean, where did you even find those two, open-mic night at the mortuary?
You have reached the office of Dr. Johann Pryce.
- Whose is it?
I mean, well, are you the father?
How complicated can it be?
The father's not in the picture, and the mother's dead.
And you're taking care of this child because...
Look, Miranda, it's really not something you need to worry about, OK?
- Now, I really need to get going.
- Well, I am fucking lactating.
- Who fucking lactates?
- Mammals, mostly.
Who have been pregnant and have had offspring.
I am sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for what you're going through.
- And uncomfortable, and...
- You're not gonna die!
Aunt Margo did, because she carried the death gene, and I bet it means that I do, too.
If you're that worried, we'll get you to a doctor, OK?
One who specializes in spontaneous freak lactation?
Dr. Arnold's been in Hemlock Grove as long as anyone can remember.
- But what if...
- Everything's gonna be OK, Miranda.
Deputy said you needed to talk.
Ready to explain why you're going around making death threats?
They weren't death threats.
There's been a series of accidents where people have died, only they're not accidents.
They're made to look that way so they fly under police radar.
And you know this how?
I see what's gonna happen in dreams before it goes down.
And I have a pet unicorn I bought on the planet Zorknoin.
I told you weren't going to believe it!
And you knew that on account of you being psychic?
I had another dream, here last night.
There was this kid that was in trouble, he was underwater, like on that Nirvana album cover.
And then there was a German shepherd!
Lucky for you, the woman you threatened scrammed out of town.
No one's around to press any charges.
I'm obliged to cut you loose.
I catch you stimulating your too-fertile imagination with weed or whatever you're hopped up on you'll be sitting down for a long time.
Let's have a look under the hood.
I pride myself on my superior bladder control.
Someone's in a buoyant mood.
Roman called.
This is good news.
That he's calling a third party instead of his mother?
It will heal.
Well, you're overdue for lab work anyway.
It's my parents'.
- Where the fuck have you been?
- It's a long story.
- She worked out a plea, and we're supposed to go over it with her before we see Lynda.
- I'm out of juice.
- Let's go!
I'll call you later.
Let's fucking go.
New charges have been filed.
I wear the pair she gave me all the time.
- How is this Lynda's problem?
Mr. Rumancek, I am exploring every remedy available, but you have to understand...
And this is a low-rent, rat-shit hustle!
She's come quite a long way since you saw her last.
But you probably don't remember.
Say hello to Prycilla, the first human being ever to be created in an extra-uterine environment.
But enough about me, let me introduce you to another of my creations, one that will set you free.
Once and for all.
The work product from a wide spectrum of genetic experiments we've been conducting, repurposed here as a nutrient concentrate to satiate the upir appetite.
Takes some getting used to, I know, but for your kind, this is on a par with the development of agriculture 8,000 years ago.
A reliable supply of sustenance that turned the hunter-gatherer into civilized man.
No more foraging in the night to ward off starvation.
No more preying on helpless victims, taking innocent life.
You've come home, Roman, and you have me to thank.
Drink.
Right now, you feel like Jesus's son.
Yeah, the wife and I, we took a trip to Norway once, and we were, you know, we're tooling around the fjords in this rust bucket rental, and, uh, you know, the tranny goes out.
Neither of us drive stick, which I'm sure was a contributing factor, but there we are, you know, marooned in Trondheim, Norway.
Look at my nose.
Now, neither of us speaks Norwegian which is not a crime by the way.
Here, you can lean back.
That you didn't speak Norwegian?
Oh, don't let the reindeer sweaters fool ya.
They are just a loathsome bunch, the Norwegians.
Never ever go there.
Thank you, Pearl.
Hey, I bet you the guy who ran you off the road's a New Yorker.
They tend to drive through here like a bat out of hell.
So how come I'm lactating for no known reason?
I have some samples around here someplace.
He doesn't really talk about that stuff.
Can you blame him for that?
Oh, brother!
Yes, I'm right here, Mrs. Blaylock.
Well, that would rule out appendicitis, Mrs. Blaylock, 'cause you need an appendix.
There's no excuse for what you did.
Frieda what-the-fuck's-her-name stole our money.
You broke her stuff for chrissake.
I told you this would happen on account of...
This has nothing to do with the moon, I'm fine!
I have every reason to be pissed at that shyster.
Disappearing to God knows where, losing your cool all the time...
My mom's rotting away in prison.
Did you do it again?
- What?
- Turn.
I have not turned.
And you haven't been fooling with those dreams?
- That's what worries me.
When we go in there, we need to accentuate the positive.
Um... we just came from the lady lawyer's.
She thinks there's a good chance we can get a lot of these charges tossed out.
No glum faces, this too shall pass.
Well, now Roman wants nothing to do with any of it at all.
This thing about becoming upir can be quite disorienting at first.
I have the results of your blood tests.
There are specific changes taking place in your bloodstream I had not noticed before.
I measured your telomeres as a baseline for my research prior to Roman's attack, then again today.
They've shortened much faster than anticipated.
Clearly one of your lab retards made a mistake.
I double-checked the results myself.
How long does this condition last?
We're in unchartered territory.
There's no clinical data for the effects of upir neurotoxin on another upir.
Are you telling me I only have a couple of hundred years left?
More like a normal human lifespan.
Human lifespan is over like that.
Hardly worth going to the trouble of being born.
And it's also possible it could reverse itself.
- Creeping mother of Christ.
- You know, it's Roman who should be concerned about his longevity if he disrupts my Ouroboros research.
I need to help him get his footing in this new chapter of his life.
- Even after what he did to you?
- He and the baby are all I have left.
Compassion doesn't suit you, Olivia.
I miss that venomous disposition and that heart the size of a caraway seed.
Well, despite what she says, our marriage is not boring.
Well, it's your wife you need to convince, not me.
I hold the record in western Pennsylvania for constructing 37 ships in bottles in a one-year period.
I mean, if that isn't not boring, I don't know what is.
Another thing she doesn't give me enough credit for is pitching in around the house.
Helping me any more would only get you in trouble.
Those are my 'shrooms.
Thanks.
Hand me that spray bottle.
- So who are you trying to assassinate?
Have a nice ride.
How long's the trip to the next squirrel cage?
You two won't mind driving back with the windows down then, huh?
You know Miss Piece-of-Shit back there assaulted one of our colleagues yesterday?
Now, if I'm not mistaken, we were just verbally assaulted while performing our duties as correctional officers.
Requiring us to report the incident to our watch commander when we arrive.
No wonder your hands are sticky, the way you two jerk each other off.
Hot in here all of a sudden.
What's going on, man?
What are you guys doing?
Hang on, Lynda, we'll have you out of there in a second.
I love you guys!
That'd be me.
Grandma Lumilda's psychoactive gypsy brain fog, absorbed transdermally through the hands.
- Poor bastards!
There are specific changes taking place in your blood cells.
You are aging at an accelerated rate.
Like a normal human lifespan.
I am not sitting around waiting for death to find me.
The gentleman would like you to join him at his table for bottle service.
Thank the gentleman and his bottle service, but I'm waiting for a friend.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a spot open for karaoke.
Any takers?
Surviving God knows how.
Now all we have to do is convince her to turn herself in.
You do not want to catch an aiding-and-abetting beef.
You know, at least if she's in custody, Shelley will be safe.
Is there, uh, anything new on Marie?
I spoke to the sheriff, did some poking around in his background, just 'cause I'm nosy, uh...
Michael Chasseur served in the 101st Airborne.
He was involved in a questionable shooting.
- He give you anything?
You know, Marie's not so reckless she's just gonna take off without telling anyone.
I've done enough rooting around this place looking for Shelley to know that whatever Marie's situation is, it isn't benign.
Seven girls were murdered.
Yeah, which my niece had nothing to do with.
- She was the last person who saw her.
- I've already been over this.
Olivia has cooperated in every conceivable way.
I don't want her bothered any more than she already has been.
It's no accident that, you know, Marie, she threatens to sue the White Tower and then she goes missing?
Honey, I'm home.
- How'd it go with the doctor?
Didn't I tell you?
Yeah, and completely hilarious.
He said this is... mostly happening on account of me being around the baby.
"Thou shalt not run your mouth about your patient's business."
But nobody else.
Not a soul outside the walls of this house, understand?
Jesus, Roman, I wish you could hear yourself.
You sound like some kind of paranoid loon.
There's a history of abuse in the baby's family.
I want to keep her as far away from that as I can.
I have to ask, is any of that even remotely true?
A hundred percent.
Her grandmother's dangerous.
And that's why you're keeping this deep dark baby secret?
Pretty selfish, actually.
Jeez, you look like the dog's dinner.
I haven't been feeling too good lately.
Don't worry, it's not contagious.
What's wrong?
Are you OK?
So here's... here's what's up with the baby.
The mother died in childbirth.
So this, um, crazy granny...
She starts screaming as soon as I get close to her.
I guess that's how the universe works.
Or doesn't work... 'cause it's all just smashed to hell and we're just a couple of broken pieces and none of this means anything.
Go take a look in your kid's eyes, and tell me you still believe that.
Because nobody wants to go, including me.
Actually, it's quite beautiful.
Your life is here, Peter.
I know, but the people in Hemlock Grove, they need you.
Man, I mean man.
Drive up here wasn't too bad, but the wait at the border, getting through customs was a nightmare.
No way are we going back home until I'm sure everything's OK.
I mean, Jack almost got run over by a truck.
Some sicko kid tells me it's not safe 'cause people are after me.
More than happy to spend a couple weeks up here with Mom, watching hockey and eating poutines.
Even though my thighs are gonna hate me, eh?
Lets go, let's go!
Asked me to smuggle some Cuban cigars back to the States for him, which I'm not going to do because then he will smell like cigar smoke.
No, I haven't slept with him yet, I'm not a complete slut.
Her GFRs are back to normal, and the creatine composition indicates robust renal sufficiency.
I'm getting an anomalous molecular weight in the purified polypeptide chain.
- So what are you telling me?
- The gel filtration of lysate...
No excuses, I want that inhibitor now.
- I need few days more...
Why or how I choose to use that enzyme is of no concern of yours.
Yes, but it is matter of allocating resources.
Hear me and hear me well, you Bolshevik stool sample.
Unless you want to find yourself on trial in the Hague for war crimes like your asshole buddy, Chemical Ali get me my fucking enzyme.
How about we go raise a glass to new life in the old country?
Not really in a glass-raising mood.
Good evening, Sheriff.
- I need you to come down to the station.
And I'm willing to bet there's a German shepherd in the mix somewhere.
Yeah, well, you're creeping me out.
You shouldn't drink so much coffee.
I should probably feed the baby.
- Roman...
- I gotta live like this.
Take 'em, take 'em, take 'em!
The White Tower, it's yours.
Please, no more.
- Don't let me be like her.
I'll take care of you.
Everything's going to be OK.
Then I killed her.
Listen, DeAngelis, you want Alison Hendrix, you show up tomorrow with my paperwork.
Look, I don't know what kind of game you're running, Vic, but you better call me.
Must've been the pressure of family day.
We want to take you to your children.
You took my babies from inside me.
Hello, Helena.
Take me to my babies.
- You gave me Kira's stem cells?
Rachel.
Hello, father.
How is it the unmonitored tramp was successful?
In her fertility?
It's already over.
Let me know when it's done, yeah?
- Where is Aldous?
- Aldous suffered a fatal heart attack on one of our jets.
I killed Dr. Leekie.
I think those are his brains.
Donnie, grab it.
Well, you're whipping it in my face.
All right, you just hold on to Alexis's hand, there.
She's the midwife.
It's just the catheter, threading through the cervix.
What is cervix?
Well, when the time is right, it'll open, wide enough to let the baby pass.
For the embryos.
I'm going to inject these into your womb and then, they will implant themselves in the lining of your womb and they'll start to grow, just as nature intended.
How is she?
The growths have spread from Cosima's uterus and lungs to her esophagus, all her epithelial tissue, and, now, her kidneys.
We know there's a way.
Yes, but it's Kira.
Only until we can buy the time for Duncan to find a cure.
I've been lied to as well.
She won't believe you.
Well said.
Me?
The chair is vacant.
You understand the human side and the science.
You'd be a wonderful ambassador.
And you need to sway Sarah.
You're uniquely qualified.
We could take this program in an entirely new direction.
So, you're the new Leekie.
Interim.
I didn't ask for it.
Right.
The stem cells had limited effect.
The disease is spreading too rapidly.
What about Duncan?
Even if we pinpoint the genetic cause, a therapy is months away, at best.
But if we can reboot her immune system...
With my kid's bone marrow?
Oh, and you believe her?
I believe that she's as invested in this as any of you.
I don't know if I trust Rachel, but, at least, we could save Cosima.
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't her only chance.
Oh, hey, don't don't don't don't don't do that, please.
Just seeing you guys is making me feel better.
Ask 'em.
We're working through it, you know?
Like officially, he died on a private jet.
That's bullshit.
So, what, no investigation, no body, nothing?
No, he died in your car.
I know what to do.
So we dump him in the lake.
I mean, random scuba divers are finding everything!
We can't risk transporting him, Donnie.
There's plenty more of that to come.
Now, let's get you dressed.
I have something I'd like to show you.
This is our nursery and preschool.
So feel free to spend as much time here as you wish.
You look tired, Mark.
Nightmares again.
They only ever gave me a mission, but, you gave me a purpose.
Well, I thank God, every day, that you went AWOL.
It could work, if it's our own terms, our own security.
I'm not even sure if I want this on the table.
Now, what's going on?
But, it's not without risk.
My sister's dying, Fee.
End of the day, it's not your decision.
It's not any of ours.
Does auntie Cosima need another tooth?
Um, something called "bone marrow".
They take it out of your hip, but they have to use a big needle.
I don't like needles.
You don't have to feel bad, love, if you don't want to do it.
Will auntie Cosima die?
She's not doing too well, so, she might.
You can wait right here until they're ready for you.
He's a virgin, in case you couldn't tell.
Oh, but it did, my good man.
That's the infertility sequence?
God, no wonder we're all screwed up.
It's encoded.
It's a vigenère's cipher and I brought the key with me.
I'll need you to generate a transcription algorithm, Scott, hmm?
This is just killer.
I'm not as perfectly comfortable with manslaughter as you!
At least I had the good sense to leave mine where she dropped.
You!
Donnie, right?
You know, my stuff with Sarah and how you two are related, and the thing you told me about Aynsley.
I don't know.
You get out of my house!
Think he's gone?
So, the doctor sailed north to the arctic, amongst the icebergs, but his creation pursued him with a terrible vengeance because the doctor had never shown his creation any love.
And so, when they finally came face-to-face, they sat down and they had a great, big bowl of iceberg cream.
One day, this room will be full of your children.
It's time to get ready, Gracie.
I just wanted to touch her hair.
Don't talk back to me.
Shall we head back, then?
There was a woman in convent like you.
You touch her again, and I will gut you like a fish.
I'm going to be here the whole time, okay?
And I'll hold your hand, yeah?
This is the last one.
She'll wake up in a few hours, but she should rest here tonight.
This gives her a real chance.
All right, sweetie.
God, I hate this garage.
This is how we take care of this family, from here on.
Beth Childs police business?
How about Art Bell, suspended for doing far less than this.
You don't want to know what we know and, if you come near my home or my family again, I will bury you.
Smile.
You are sad to be pregnant?
Might as well eat.
You will be fat soon, anyway.
I thought you like Mark.
I'm carrying your babies.
My babies in your cervix?
Not really.
Okay, one adapted transcription algorithm.
It was Susan's sterility concept...
Degrade the endometrium, prevent ovarian follicles from maturing.
Why not tweak our hormones or modify our reproductive organs, somehow?
Normal development was the prime directive.
This was the least-invasive solution.
Unfortunately, we didn't, uh, foresee the consequences.
Well, that depends on DYAD's intentions.
Hello, Gracie.
Are you well?
She has no idea.
The women here don't see it that way.
You caught me reminiscing.
A heart attack on one of our jets.
I'm bereft.
Dr. Cormier is an interesting choice for the chair.
How are you, Rachel?
Besides bereft.
You've learned a lot about yourself, lately.
Tell topside that Rachel is fine.
I know what our goals are and I've only just taken charge.
I'm glad to hear it.
But this is a personal call.
Sarah Manning intrigues me.
Doesn't she you?
Biologically, yes.
But it's not just her biology that's gotten her this far, is it?
You were bred into this, given every advantage, but Sarah?
Sarah's a product of chance, yet, here we are, at loggerheads with her.
Thank you, darling.
Dr. Neilan.
Yes, it's Rachel Duncan.
I need your expertise.
You've done it.
Well, not yet.
But we have the marrow processing for transplant.
Good.
What time?
Okay, here you go.
There you go.
What are you doing?
I don't belong here.
But, where will you go?
To my sestra.
You're a good girl, Grace.
If you don't want to have my babies, don't have my babies.
I would never do that.
I'm coming with you.
You disappoint me, daughter.
Go back to your beds.
No, father.
We trusted you to counsel her, to help her embrace her purpose.
I'm not afraid of you.
Mother's gone out west to find more broodmares.
Both of you can go to hell.
She's got a lot of thinkin' to do.
She's your daughter.
You had to put your own child inside of her?
Come on.
I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now.
The bedroom.
The freezer.
They are going to need me when they get older.
Cow baby.
She's outside.
What's going on?
I saw something about that man that works with you.
Tell me.
Rachel may have compromised him.
Shit.
What does she want?
Pleasure to meet you, Felix.
What's wrong?
I made a terrible mistake.
What have you done?
Mummy.
How are you feeling, Kira?
Where's my mum?
Where's Mrs. S?
But, you'll get used to it.
You may even grow to like it here.
I find it hard to believe we could keep it secret.
I'm worried our partners might try to take us out when this is over.
You asked me to let you know if there was anything unusual about Duncan Carlisle's personal or professional life.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Carlisle.
Walk straight ahead.
All right stop.
What the hell is going on?
I apologize for the inconvenience, ma'am.
We're only doing all of this, to make sure you're safe.
Did my husband tell you to do this?
I'm sorry.
We're leaving first thing in the morning.
I got driver's license, passports, keys to the house in Florida.
Maybe we should think about splitting up for a while.
Yeah, but, at some point, we're going to have to accept the risk.
I mean, we can't live apart forever.
I know it's not ideal, but we have to do whatever it takes to make sure the kids are safe, right?
This has nothing to do with our relationship.
It doesn't?
Everything has changed.
We both are.
I'm only going to say this one time.
Release my wife and daughter now!
Your wife was trying to flee the country.
She's a liability to me, to you and to herself.
But rest assured, your wife and daughter will be released the second our friend on Pennsylvania Avenue is dead.
You have my word.
I found what we were looking for.
Sandrine is definitely working for the other side.
How do you want to do it?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Duncan wants us to run an errand.
I just want to make a sandwich.
We'll stop at a diner on the way back.
My treat.
She breaks the law, kills people.
Get her out of your head.
We got more important things to deal with.
- Like what?
- Nina and Sawyer.
I'm not sure.
It's almost impossible to track them down.
Where's the pickup spot?
The warehouse.
You gonna get that?
Sounds like a jealous girlfriend.
I'm single.
Does the chick know that?
Look the phone is making me nervous, either answer it or shut the damn thing off.
I need to use her for something else.
Copy that.
You know, you should pack light.
You're going to be moving around a lot.
Before too long, you're gonna have a new house new friends, new life.
I know it doesn't seem that way now, but... things will be normal again.
It's okay, it's just me.
Tomorrow morning, 5:45, I'll make sure the house is clear.
Just wait for my text, okay?
We just walk out the front door, right?
Everything's going to be all right.
You mind waiting outside?
You mind telling me what's going on?
Archer found the bombs.
You never stop lying, do you?
You're working with Logan.
He gave you three small shaped charges to kill us.
I made a deal with Logan.
Find my wife.
Well, it's game time.
Good luck tomorrow.
I love you, Mom.
Okay, let's go.
It's going to be okay.
What is it?
- Thank you.
- Good luck.
- They left.
- Yeah, I know.
Thank you, for... helping them.
It's not easy, I know.
But they're gonna be fine.
I left a bag on the kitchen counter.
I need you to bring it to work and stick it inside the fire extinguisher case closest to the operating room.
She's going to need to be strong to get through the transplant.
You need to do more than discuss, Ellen.
You need to convince.
Getting the President's bone marrow doesn't mean a damn thing if we can't get it out of the hospital.
You back?
Yeah, traffic was light.
- How'd it go with Collins?
Hates the government more than anyone I ever met.
I guess that's why he's an anarchist.
You answer all his questions?
Hospital specs, security information.
He has no clue he's being set up, either.
What does that mean?
I needed her help.
I know we're friends and all, but you're pushing it, man.
It was supposed to be easy, 24 hours, in and out, nobody gets hurt.
Obviously that didn't work out.
I can't guarantee she's going to come through, which means I can't guarantee you'll get paid.
I thought you said she was all in.
That is not what I was hoping to hear right now.
If we don't succeed, I'll make this right.
I'll pay you out of my own pocket.
I could probably get my hands on 50 grand or so.
I say we dial up the pressure, she's got one kid left, Morgan.
She has to know we will put her down, too, if she doesn't deliver.
They're in the hospital.
No, Kramer's already there.
Like I said, man, I don't know if this thing is gonna work.
But the President's gonna die, so if you want to take off now, before things go sideways, I totally get it.
Hell no.
We're friends, right?
For life.
Logan took the pill bottles.
Now we just need to follow them, see where they end up.
That's okay, Sawyer.
These men are just trying to keep us safe.
From what?
Your medication.
- Who gave you this?
- Doesn't matter.
What the hell is going on?
35 Saratoga Drive.
I don't have to give her anything.
I didn't have a choice.
How long are we going to be gone?
I'm not sure.
I agree.
But we may have to split up for a while, just to make it harder for them to find us.
You and I will stay together and Jake and Mom will be together.
Sounds like Mom found out about the affair, then.
What are you talking about?
Dad, I've known for a long time.
I just didn't say anything.
The man next to us is staring at me.
I think I might have seen his car earlier, when we were at the gas station, do you think that he's following us?
Yeah, you're probably right.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Where are you guys goin'?
Uh, I need to discuss a few things with my contact at the Secret Service.
I thought he was at the hospital.
Tough to know who to believe these days.
Then again, I spend most of my time hangin' out with criminals.
All right, uh, water, some protein bars, anything else?
Sounds good.
Is someone following us?
I don't know, it seems like somebody's trailing us.
I'm at a rest stop off I-95.
You took back roads all the way to the highway?
It's impossible to say...
I really can't tell you, but, just be careful.
Hey, uh, get back in the car.
I can't believe you shot him!
All right, get in.
- Is he dead?
- We get the hell out of here.
Copy that.
Looks good.
- No...
So, I just have a few more questions for you.
Have you taken any medication in the past week?
Uh, just the usual, I take a pill every day for my cholesterol.
I hired you for political reasons.
It was a shameless publicity stunt.
No, but, uh, you would wanna make sure he doesn't take one this evening.
I'll notify his mistress.
Please, his infidelity is the worst kept secret in DC.
May I ask, have you given any more thought to the conversation we had yesterday?
About the genetic marker for dementia?
And why didn't you?
Because, as I said, I imagined it something you would wanna keep off the record.
Would you like some tea?
All right, look, let's just relax.
I don't know if you guys know this, but, uh, we're all on the same side.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
I saw the pill bottles in the bedroom, but that's it.
Now, what?
Any idea where your friends might have taken them?
Look, I could go back and talk to Logan again, but my guess is that he'll put a bullet in my head.
Someone found the chip.
He already knows I set him up.
Thanks for helping out.
I didn't do it for you.
Which means alerting the White House physician.
Well, when the surgery is over, I'll have someone bring you into the operating room, and I'll hand it to you.
My husband's a good man.
The safe house is owned by the V.E. Moore Family Trust.
Vanessa Moore.
I know we've never officially met, but...
Excuse me?
I'm Special Agent Duncan Carlisle.
How can I help you, Agent Carlisle?
I want my wife and daughter back.
What are you talking about?
I want my wife and daughter back, tonight.
Calm down, okay?
You need to call Blair right now and tell him to release my wife and daughter.
He won't do it.
Blair doesn't trust me anymore.
We had a falling out.
What does that mean?
He's gonna kill you, and extort me.
He is not an easy man to kill.
That's why you need my help.
And that I care about you.
Logan is threatening my son.
He said if I played ball, he would help us escape.
I believe you.
I know.
Hold up.
I know we said we were even, but, I still need your help.
With what?
Killing Blair.
Who's that?
The man in charge.
This is it.
How come you never said anything about my relationship?
It didn't bother me.
I mean, I love Mom... but I also know that... things happen and people grow apart.
I feel horrible about it every day.
I let you guys down.
You made a mistake.
Thank you.
Oh, there he is.
Hey, Jake!
Hate to spoil the party, but you guys aren't goin' anywhere until the President's dead.
What the hell is going on?
I apologize for the inconvenience, ma'am.
Call Blair right now and tell him to release my wife and daughter.
She's the President's daughter, isn't she?
You'll need to kill him.
You remember Dr. Evans, my personal physician?
I'm told you have a plan already in place.
We can take down the President of the United States.
Eventually you'll meet up with your family.
There's no reason to keep us hostage.
Duncan lied to you.
I don't believe you.
How else do you explain Jake still being alive?
All I know is there's something else going on.
Duncan wouldn't change the plan.
Still not too late.
There is no payday.
He'll know who we are.
I demand to speak to my husband.
I know he's the one behind all of this.
What promise?
They're both fine.
You have one minute as agreed.
What did you get us involved in?
Nina, I'm so sorry.
I just need you to be strong a little longer.
Let me talk to Sawyer.
You can talk to them both after our business is concluded.
And then you can all live happily ever after.
You don't really think that son of a bitch intends to let them go, do you?
What time will Blair arrive at the event?
About an hour or so.
I've done some further reading, Dr. Sanders.
We're with the blue team.
Glad you could make it.
Nervous?
See you in there.
Uh, I just found out something... important.
We're in position.
Excuse me?
Do you work for that guy?
- Who is he?
There was a guy taking video of him.
Who was the guy?
It was one of the waiters, but I've never seen him at work before.
Retractor.
Scalpel.
Forceps, please.
Nicely done, Dr. Sanders.
Where are we going?
Colonel.
This is all a misunderstanding.
You really expect me to believe you?
He wants to sit down with you before he gives his speech.
Now?
I suggested that you might have some policy ideas for him.
There's a shortcut through the kitchen.
I want my wife and daughter back.
I'm sorry.
You are making a mistake.
I have no reason to hurt your family and I will release them.
As soon as the job is complete.
Well, I don't feel like waiting.
Take out your phone, and make the call.
Otherwise, I'll put a bullet in your head.
More retraction, please.
What is that?
He could bleed out.
That's the signal.
Keep the suction in there.
What the hell was that?
Shut down hospital power immediately.
Get the gauze in there.
Glow sticks.
The President is bleeding out.
Let's go.
We're on frequency alpha, go ahead.
Identify yourselves.
What's the password?
Password?
What's the password?
What password?
Everyone out this way, go.
Protect these doors at all costs.
Let nobody in this room, you understand?
Don't you die on me.
You can do this.
An unknown number of terrorists have attacked the hospital where President Kincaid is undergoing surgery.
Sounds to me like it's going down.
There has been no direct contact with the President's security detail since the shooting started.
So, can I go now?
Your wife and daughter are safe.
We're not finished.
I hold no grudge about the back and forth between us.
You have no reason to hold a grudge against me.
Except for the fact that you planned to eliminate me all along.
That is not true.
You picked the wrong side.
We're not going to spend the rest of our lives, looking over our shoulders.
I'm afraid you've left me with no choice, Colonel.
Is the President going to die because of me?
No.
I don't believe you.
That's not going to happen.
I promise.
Can't see a thing...
You don't have to do this.
There is an alternative.
If anything happens to either one of us, release the tape.
You can't trust him.
The tape is the guarantee that neither one of us will ever speak or come after the other one.
There's been enough killing.
Get him out of here and let's do this.
All right, move.
Check the President.
The President is stable.
You saved him.
Air is clear.
- Is he all right?
Dr. Sanders, I want to thank you.
He was barricaded in the operating room during the siege.
All we want is our lives back.
Duncan agreed to set you free.
I can't believe you pulled it off, Ellen.
I'll meet you at Burton's.
Let's just talk about this.
Stop here.
Get down on your knees.
Close your eyes.
- Why are you doing this?
- Do as you're told!
- This It Archer, leave a message.
Where's my money?
And you chose to betray me.
You should've told me the truth, D.
I'm sorry.
All I ever gave you was my loyalty.
I'm sorry.
You can beat this disease, Nina.
You don't owe me an apology.
You didn't ask for any of this.
What he did was wrong.
And I don't know if I can accept this.
You need to do what's right for you.
You should get out of the country tonight.
- Burton, I'm not running.
Give us a minute.
I am.
How bad is it?
You'll survive.
Blair is dead.
I don't think anybody's going to be looking for you.
This is it.
We made it.
No, you made it.
That's the difference between us.
You got through this entire thing without ever losing yourself.
I wish I could say the same.
Goodbye, Ellen.
How're you feeling, Paul?
A little weak, but happy to be alive.
We'll see about that.
There is no justification for what you did.
I understand.
But I'm going back to the hospital tomorrow with the bone marrow.
I want to live.
- Thank you.
- I'm not doing it for you.
She thinks you walk on water.
What am I supposed to tell her, Duncan?
The truth.
I love you.
What happened to your eye?
I want to tell you something.
- Daddy has to go away.
- For how long?
It might be a while.
But what about my birthday?
Thank you, Daddy.
I love you.
I love you, too.
More than anything.
Dr. Sanders told me what happened with you and Kate Renner.
Kate Renner?
How could she know about...
Suddenly, it's all clear to me.
You had Peter killed, didn't you?
My own brother.
Who put that idea in your head?
I did.
I've defended you for too long.
You're going to have to pay for your crimes, Paul.
What are you doing here?
Could I catch a ride?
You don't even know where I'm going.
Where are you going?
I'm going to see my son.
Then I guess I'll keep moving after that.
Works for me.
You're a good person, Kramer.
A lot better than me.
I'm not sure we belong together.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
- You're crazy, you know that?
Besides, I need you to look after Nina and Sawyer.
- She won't forgive me.
We wanted to go as a family.
Sounds like a plan.
Let me rephrase that.
Well, that's the third customer that didn't stop because of that rap car.
To be fair, this place wasn't Walmart on Black Friday before the car showed up.
Stupid, but brave.
At least take this pan, and cover the part you wanna get shot in the least.
I need to see your head at all times.
Have I been shot?
It wasn't the blue one with the tinted windows, aka, the murder car?
Aka, the murder car?
Tell me that's the name of the make and model, like, "The Toyota murder".
Are you sure you're not thinking of the Honda stabbing?
Caroline, some guy stopped by asking for you with a festive bandana and a teardrop tattoo.
A festive bandana and a teardrop tattoo... are you sure it wasn't my mother?
I don't have friends with tattoos.
I don't even have friends with split ends.
You gave a stranger my number.
Your number, your email, and your address.
Max, am I in trouble?
Pick-up, dead meat.
What does that mean?
It means it's never a good idea to have a car with tinted windows towed.
That's rule number one.
I thought rule number one was, "Always wipe front to back."
- Max, I'm worried.
What's up, Nat King Cool?
Hey, my brother from a Jewish mother.
Hey, my daddy that just smoked a fatty.
Oh, look, Max, it's your boyfriend.
I made out with a guy in the diner last week.
They're natural, and they hurt my back.
I also wanted to know if you want to hang tomorrow night.
Ooh, so like a date.
I'm willing to throw $10, $15 at this thing.
You want to throw $15 at my thing?
Great.
I usually charge $5.
You came all the way here to ask me out?
Okay, dummy.
Okay, Han, I can't hold you up anymore.
Max, I think I just saw the murder car go by, out the bathroom window.
- What exactly did you see?
No, seriously, I think it followed me home.
Well, three years ago, you followed me home, so we're even.
There you go, Nancy.
That was me, to that girl scout.
If you tell someone you're carrying thin mints, you best be carrying thin mints.
Max, you're coming back tonight, right?
If you don't want to be alone, why don't you call Han?
Very funny.
Don't you have to have a first life to have a second life?
Max, please stay.
Call Deke and cancel, or else you might come home to find me in a pool of blood.
Oh, I always wanted a pool.
Oh, no, it's them, here to kill me.
Oh, hi, girls.
You know, I just came from the dentist's office.
Did you know that Michael Jackson died?
Well, since you're here, do you want to stay and have a girls' night?
Oh, that's sounds like fun.
And Caroline's afraid to be alone.
Well, if you don't want to be alone, then why do you act the way you do?
I got to go meet Deke.
We are going out to get wasted, hopefully to the point of blowing chunks on each other's shoes.
But imagine it a little less romantic than it sounds.
- Well, we tried.
Good night.
You know, in Poland, when the Cossacks came, we would boil water and then throw it in their faces, and then make soup.
Hello?
Well, Nancy, looks like it's just you and me.
No offense, Nancy, but we really need a dog in this situation.
Brown chicken what?
You know, "Bowm chicka bowm bowm," but I made it... ♪ Brown chicken, brown cow ♪
So you thought of that in your head, and your brain was like, "That's okay to say"?
No, my brain was like "don't say it, don't say it, don't say it, don't say it".
Well, this is me.
All I see is a dumpster.
- Yeah, it's my apartment.
Oh, you're not kidding.
So do you have to go?
And if you think it's cool now, watch this.
My dumpster's a grower, not a show-er.
Yes, but there's also solar panels on the roof and a microwave and a bathroom right here.
You have a microwave next to your toilet?
I think of everything.
And if you don't like your neighbors, you push your house to a new street.
Or you could just kill them and throw their bodies in here.
Free delivery, yo.
I'll take it.
All right, but it comes with a very handsome stuffed animal of a man with hair that gets him followed by security at Macy's.
So what was your first time having sex in a dumpster like?
Next time I won't be wearing this hat.
- This is really nice.
I got to go.
Plus, I got to pull these boots on.
Chinese restaurant just delivered.
And also, you are a grown lady.
Why is your outgoing message a fart?
And I am sure you're in the middle of having very silly sex, but it is a nightmare around here.
Chestnut, Nancy, and I are all convinced that the murder car is still circling and about to take us all out.
So self-involved.
That'd be funny if you got jokes.
Okay, guys, here's the plan.
If they come in that door, we go out this door.
If they come in that door, Chestnut, you block them, and, Nancy, you go for their eyes.
No time!
My legs!
If it helps, your toes do look bigger.
Thank God I have these flip-flops I used to wear in your shower before I gave up.
- Insurance provider?
Come right in.
What is the problem?
I'll need more information than that.
You're not gonna answer it?
No, right now, I am very concerned about your legs.
Why did you even come home tonight?
Was the sex bad?
- So...?
Oh, that's what this feeling is.
Caroline, sorry I didn't text you back.
I would've come over last night, but my second life wife had a baby.
I just can't believe you had fake sex nine months ago and didn't tell anyone.
No!
So can I take you out sometime?
Uh... uh, very sweet, and you seem great, but I'm already in a relationship with a guy in a red bandana.
What did you just do?
You never say no to a guy with tinted windows.
That's rule number two.
Max, why'd you leave last night?
What about the scratches on my back?
Oh, track one, "Make It Nasty."
And it was worse when we did it the second time.
And that third time was a disaster.
I mean, I only lasted 47 minutes, and you screamed.
You wouldn't be the first guy to do that tonight.
Nor will he be the last.
Okay, what do you wanna show me?
Is that your dumpster?
Look, you said you couldn't stay over because you lived all the way over by the diner, so I moved it here to figure out what your next excuse would be.
Um, I'm racist.
You have a bird on your shirt.
You love it.
I do.
What else?
- I got nothin'.
Duct tape my wrists, throw a bag over my head, and toss me in.
- Awful, huh?
- So bad.
Want to do it again later, and then sleep over tonight, and then do it again?
Sure.
Are we ever gonna do it naked?
Then why do you have that big smile on your face?
I'm faking it.
Why is it shaking?
Are we still having sex?
He lives in a dumpster?
Yeah, but on purpose.
But you're coming home tonight, right?
Han, what are you doing tonight?
"This is the greatest book anyone's ever written in any genre."
I can see your whole future.
You are gonna be so hungover tomorrow.
Kids... the story behind that vow took place the morning of Barney and Robin's wedding.
You see, after drinking way too much the night before, this is all your Uncle Barney remembers from the first two hours of his wedding day.
And that's it.
You know, he looks better than I thought he would.
There's a gas leak!
The building's on fire!
Okay, I think my fiancé peed himself a little.
Oh, tomorrow I'm gonna be able to say my husband peed himself a little.
I didn't really spill some iced tea on him.
He can't take a bad photo.
And I will not break that vow as sure as I will always have a full head of hair!
It was supposed to be a victory party.
You ran a great campaign, baby.
Yeah, but it was the most stressful three weeks of my life!
As your next commissioner...
State Supreme Court judge.
Like, uh, shoveling snow.
Or, like, uh, if a police horse dumps out in the park.
You're clearly ripping off the story of the Manhattan Project, which was run by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.
So I'm gonna guess it was your distant relative Barnert Stinsonheimer?
Somebody's read their history books.
The Too Many Manhattans Project hit a few snags at first.
Like, way better.
Okay, we somehow have to get this leaky barf bag back on his feet before the wedding pictures.
Well, we know what Barney would want us to do.
Marshall, you and Ted go gather the ingredients we do know.
Robin, you wake up Barney long enough to find out the secret ingredient.
Okay, let's start simple.
I'll get the elevator.
Okay, so... accidentally throwing Barney down the stairs did not wake him up.
Nor did banging his head on each step as we dragged him back up here.
So, how do we wake him up long enough to tell us the final ingredient?
You know, when my sister and I had trouble getting up for school, my dad a few cute little tricks.
Your dad used to do this to you?
My baby boy's in college.
From-from binge studying.
But every story from your 20s starts in a bar.
Listen to your mother.
Ginger, bananas, Funyuns.
I cannot believe that minimart sold Tantrum.
It's been discontinued for years.
Okay, there's only one more item on the list and... it's an odd one.
Grease?
Our menu is organic.
Point is, it tastes really good.
Also, uh, we need it to help a friend recover from a hangover.
Wait a second.
I'm a Columbia-educated lawyer, poised to become a judge before age 35.
And remind me, how did you celebrate getting accepted into Columbia?
I'm out, okay?
You eat the bacon.
I have seen the face of God.
Okay, there is one thing we haven't tried yet.
Making out with each other.
Look at this soggy bag of snot.
That's it, I am joining Marshall's vow.
I am never, ever getting that drunk again.
Kids, you see where this is going.
Did last night really happen?
I think so.
Every time.
You want me to get her?
No, I got her.
You know what, Ted, you've been going at it real hard.
Well, congratulations.
Here's your grease.
I finally found the one, Marshall.
Her name is Bacon.
You know, this would go great on one of my mom's LT sandwiches.
And that's the first and last time I ever ate bacon.
Not everything.
You're beautiful.
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
That's the secret.
So, Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie?
I knew those shrooms tasted like Sea-Monkeys.
How do you know what Sea-Monkeys taste like?
He loves us?
No, I can't do it.
Your kindergarten field trip to the jackhammer and siren museum today is gonna be legendary.
I-I'm never gonna recover from this.
I'm now a guy who got left at the altar.
There's no coming back from that.
Drink this.
You're gonna be okay.
Barney made up the Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir so we would all believe that we could rally.
I mean, even though it's fake, it-it worked.
I wish we could help him out the way he helped us.
But the wedding photos are in 20 minutes.
You've earned my respect today, son.
That's what the bride wants to hear.
Well, he bought it.
And the best part is your dad has no idea.
And, look, some good came out of all this.
Seeing you like that, we all vowed never to get that drunk again.
And in those moments, we all need someone who loves us to help us rally.
Even if that means lying once in a while.
It's normal, it's totally normal.
So, where should we go?
So stupid.
Oh, God, maybe we should get you to the emergency room.
Wrong leg, wrong leg, wrong leg!
- I got this.
- All right, fine.
Guess it stopped.
Wait.
Nope, just gas.
You'll have plenty of time to spend with that baby after Violet dumps it on you.
- Thanks, Mom.
- It's funny... 'cause it's true.
It was so smart to keep this walking boot.
How'd you hurt your ankle the last time?
- You're serious?
This thing is filled with bacteria.
She watched a very scary exposé on the 6:00 news about how your kitchen can kill you and everyone you love.
Somebody really needs to get laid.
- I can hear you, Mom.
- You were meant to.
By the way, it's gonna rain again in a couple of days.
What do you want to do about the leak?
I don't know.
If I could figure out where the hole was, I'd probably jab a tampon in it.
Nice.
That way, the house can do archery and ride a horse.
I guess I'll just climb up there and throw a big tarp over everything.
You don't even know to microwave a sponge.
How's that not gonna end in tears?
Well, I'm calling him.
- Maybe you should get laid.
Might want to microwave your sheets.
Just cover as much of the roof as you can, and I'll get a roofer out here next week.
Can you find the leak, cover it with hot tar, and then reshingle?
There's a couple of steps I didn't know about, but yeah.
- That's where you went wrong.
- I got weed.
- Forgiven.
- Need any help?
- That makes two of us.
Here, let's just rip up shingles, and if we see the living room, we've gone too far.
Apparently, you gotta take the water out first.
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- The Capital of Ethiopia is Addis Ababa.
What?
- It's starting to kick.
I just don't want to turn into my father.
I hope so.
They're getting ready to order pizza.
I'm nine.
Nothing to brag about.
I knew I should've handled this myself.
We... are not... getting high!
She knows, dude.
It was so smart to save this.
- Your ankle's the size of a grapefruit.
You just fell off a freaking ladder.
It's a miracle you're not driving a wheelchair with your tongue.
- Soup's up.
Son of a bitch.
I'm done.
Thank you. [sniffs]
How do you feel about some hot soup?
You'll understand that soon enough.
- Ah, it was nothing.
No, man, it was a big help.
I would give you a "world's greatest dad" T-shirt unironically.
I'm just so tired.
That's because you don't let anybody help you.
And you don't know how to fluff a pillow.
Oh, go fluff yourself.
- You seriously don't?
If I didn't cook dinner, I didn't eat.
At least the fridge was filled with food.
Do I have to remind you that I raised myself?
What's that got to do with you being a bitter, angry, resentful woman right now?
I said this is not a conversation!
Awesome.
Do you honestly believe you have to remind me how much I screwed up?
The actual amount of time is not important.
All you need to know is I am trying to be here for you right now, and you can stop beating me up for who I used to be, because I've got that covered.
But I like beating you up.
I'll punish myself the rest of the week.
- Well, it is Monday.
It would've been better if you cried.
I'll work on it.
I'm so sorry, baby.
Purple's such a pretty color.
I do love taking care of you.
I love it, too, Mom.
- I didn't.
And you will be missed.
- I'm helping!
- What is wrong with you?
- Get out of my way.
Christy, stop!
I have been sleeping on this medieval rack for a month and you never told me it folds out into a bed?
Didn't I?
I meant to.
You're a pathetic excuse for a daughter.
Just so you know, I won't be here when you get home.
- Mom, stop.
You are very welcome.
I can't forgive you.
But I will stay.
I can do this myself.
Yeah, no kidding.
I just hope you understand I'm gonna need some time to rebuild my trust in you, which, frankly, has been shattered.
- You told me you were broke!
- Emotionally!
I took you in because you couldn't pay your own rent.
Well, there's "couldn't" and-and "didn't want to."
- So you lied to me.
- Uh... this couch folds out.
$4,000?
I only had $3,000 when I moved in!
Uh, honey?
Don't make Mommy kill you.
I don't have a mother.
So.. we're good?
Sure.
Let's just call it even and move on.
- Yes, I want to do this.
- I'll give you $4,000 if you go first.
She and I were, you know...
Oh, my God.
You were gay?
That's what she said.
- Amnesty.
- There was a gun to my head.
They made me dig my own grave!
Ooh, that's too bad.
I was voted queen of the prom.
Okay, here's a biggie.
Your father.
What?
You always said you didn't know who he was.
It could have been a dozen guys.
I lied, I always knew it was Alvin.
Oh, my God.
- What's amnesty?
- Uh, it's when you can't remember stuff.
What's going on?
Nothing, we have to run some errands.
Very nice, lie to your daughter.
How'd you find him?
Sounds like you have a little unfinished business with him.
Yeah, if I finish it, I'll have to go to jail.
Roscoe, it's your turn to take out the garbage.
- I'll do it later.
- Pause the video game and do it now.
No, he has to learn to respect his elders.
His elders?
Five minutes ago you were making armpit farts.
- You want to get spanked?
Who is this kid?
- So, what's he do?
- He owns a body shop.
- Really, and he has a pool?
- Ah, relax, it's above ground.
- He's Chinese?
- Oh, sorry, that's just a fella I, you know, keep company with.
What the hell was that?
I don't look anything like him.
He's five-five.
Oh, Daddy.
Is the little jerk not eating?
He's not a jerk, and he won't come out of his room because he thinks you're a jerk.
Hey, this ass got swatted plenty and it's a better ass for it.
- Well, then we have a problem.
What's the problem?
I intend to raise our child with patience and understanding.
Why don't we start now?
Go talk to Roscoe, make peace.
He threatened my nuts!
For me.
Thanks for making that decision for me.
I'm about to go over there and hear his side of the story.
May have been related to a Trinitron TV that went missing.
Anyway, I, uh, met your father shortly thereafter.
We were in love.
He made you a crib out of leather.
It all sounds great.
- He just left you there?
- Oh, damn.
I hate it when you become a real person with feelings.
Okay, miss, what can I do you for?
- I'm Christy.
- All right.
Oh, look, we're the same height.
It's that '91 Jetta over there.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
All right, well, thanks for your time.
Yeah, my oldest son there is just back from Afghanistan, and the younger one is a DJ or something.
But I'm sure I did dumber things when I was his age.
Like what?
Well, like... none of your business.
Amnesty!
You can go on a long walk with a person.
Oh, we just walk around.
She gets antsy if she doesn't get outside enough.
And then it's just yap, yap, yap, all day long.
(charles) hey, what's kelly's favorite food?
Peanut butter.
She'll eat it right out of the jar.
How old is kelly again?
Oh, that's so awful.
Was she chasing something into the street, or...
How can you ask me that?
I borrowed them to do an impression of you.
Peralta, give me my glasses.
Peralta, give me back my glasses.
All right, lay out the steroids case.
He did seven years at rikers for assault.
Sergeant jeffords is just getting back in the field.
Why is everyone so worried about the sarge?
I mean, he saved your life at the rail yard.
Trust me, the sergeant will be fine.
Damn straight.
'cause you're a sucker for a high five.
Damn straight I am.
Gina, you work in a police precinct.
You think these buffoons can help?
They're buffoons.
They are not buffoons.
Try the heel.
Some of them are buffoons.
But I'll find the non-buffoons to investigate.
Could you ask scully to return my thumbtacks?
You ready, sarge?
Let's talk strategy later tonight at my house.
My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.
But you're ready for this, right?
I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.
The ebony falcon needs to read go, dog, go.
Yeah, he does.
The adrenaline is gonna carry me through.
Sorry I'm not rich like you, miss 1%.
Because I'm civilized.
Less talky-talk, more solvey-solve.
We need an itemized list of everything that was stolen.
I already gave it to captain holt.
One knockoff designer clutch...
Can't you just buy another knockoff?
No, I can't, silly sue.
Can you estimate the value of everything that was taken?
Emotionally, $700 million.
Sorry about the mess.
Hey, your kids like the same kind of cereal as me.
All right, time for night-night, girls.
He is so strong but so gentle.
He's like an enormous, muscular ellen degeneres.
You know, daddy will never leave you, right, girls?
I'm worried about terry.
We can't let anything bad happen to him.
Jake, where are you?
In here.
We have to get terry off this case.
Or his wife or other family or his more mature friends,
If you have concerns, maybe you should talk to terry about it.
Yeah, that's why I've never tried to develop an edge.
International taxes and tariffs.
Work.
But I promise you I am.
No, it's not even that, you know, it's just...
Do you have a bone there somehow?
They both like to snuggle against his head.
Crime tech report from your apartment came back.
I bought a lock of his hair at an auction.
That's cool it's real.
What'd they say about the prints?
Should I buy a handgun?
Should I buy a shotgun?
Should I buy an uzi?
Look, gina, we've done all we can.
An official civilian complaint with the captain.
"procedure" is just a fancy word for proper order to do things.
Yes, that is it's definition.
This is a miscarriage of justice.
Also brandon jacoby should be here soon.
How was that not one of your two things?
It was an interesting interaction.
I spent 40 minutes making that water bottle pyramid display.
This guy is a psycho.
The longer we wait the more likely our cover gets blown.
I'll make contact.
Trainer and known hemophiliac, so be careful.
Trent is also a quaker who avoids violence at all costs.
You trent?
Okay.
I mean, what do you need leg muscles for anyway?
Socially acceptable for you to roll around on a scooter.
I lost the count.
I've heard about this in the news!
Damn it.
His children could be orphans already.
Fatherless, mother-having orphans.
I'm sure he's fine.
Nothing happened.
Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside.
You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress.
He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no,
Okay, but let's build up that relationship slowly, okay?
We don't want to jump the gun and spook him.
What'd you say your regular gym was?
Or did I save your life?
I'm sensing from your tone it's that one.
Gina came by my house last night to go over the case.
I will say she makes a wonderful rye.
So dense, yet so moist.
Hello, ladies.
Say hello to leo sporm.
How do you know if your husband's a murderer?
You don't.
(male announcer) call leo now.
Leo sporm.
The picasso of hucksters.
I like that.
Point to your delts, jake.
I can handle this.
The ebony falcon.
And what does the ebony falcon do?
Hell yeah, he does.
How's it going?
I'm not talking.
We gotta solve the case before he does.
I've been waiting so long to hear you say those words.
Experience the future of cloud-based scheduling.
I feel a little uncomfortable leaving him out of this.
Just headed out to close the steroid case.
Isn't sergeant jeffries interrogating the suspect now?
She's scared.
She's not scared.
With all due respect, sir, gina has no feelings.
Well, think about how she's been acting.
Gina came by my house last night.
I asked for a police officer to escort me to work,
Her home doesn't feel safe anymore.
Do I still have my knife?
It was a hypothetical question.
I know, but I want to play it out.
Do I still have my throwing stars?
We're on it.
What kind of woman doesn't have an axe?
All right, we're all set for the sting.
Said that I was filling in for jacoby.
You lied to me!
I took three years of tap.
Again, sarge, it's so good to see you.
Just out of curiosity, how did you find out about this?
I'm a detective sergeant in the nypd.
You gonna talk to me now?
And I don't want it to happen to them.
Why didn't you just say something to me?
It's been a rough year.
I love it when you say "bogeys."
We good.
Classic.
I can imagine how frightening this must be.
Really?
That makes me feel so much better.
Thank you, guys.
These are right there with you.
You hit me in the arms so hard they no longer work.
It's good to be back.
He's the ebony antelope now.
Why is everyone so worried about the sarge?
He made the buy, took out the suppliers,
That does make me happy.
Guess we're being candid today.
I'm not scared for you at all.
Of you a lot.
Thanks, jake.
Oh, peralta, I almost forgot.
I just told them my aunt was too sick, I couldn't leave.
I'm looking for the phone number and address for Helen Leavis.
We're taking the kids to the rides at the park on Saturday.
P-Paige and Henry-- go.
It's the one chance to get in there and read the settings on the machine.
Mr. Dameran.
Look, I put my life on the line to get here.
I never worried about Paige and Henry being safe.
How are we gonna live like this?
He shits a lot.
How is Emmett handling it?
The "Revolver" album is the best.
When do you think?
Um, I'm not sure.
I wouldn't tell the Centre that.
Looks good.
How long have you been watching?
Not long enough.
Any word?
Do you feel better?
It's not gonna work.
Let me see.
See, what you're supposed to do is rotate the wheel to the time you want, and then match it with the real stars.
And if we're not, there's Salisbury steak in the freezer.
You know Salisbury steak is technically a hamburger in the shape of a steak.
They said it just transformed their lives.
Uh, so, how was your night?
I watched a guy do laundry all night.
What single guy does four loads of laundry?
What married guy does four loads of laundry?
That's a good point.
Matthew's in the shower, so...
Hey, Henry, after school, a few of the girls are going into Georgetown to buy jeans.
Cobbler said General Westmoreland's gonna ask for 100,000 more troops.
It was worth it in the situation.
The Centre heard there's a new assessment at the Pentagon.
They know two people who have access to it, and they want you to try one of them tomorrow night.
I'm ready.
Are you sure?
You'll make a good father.
You all right?
I made a few phone calls.
He's been taken in by a family.
Jared?
You want a soda?
I'm serious, Philip.
We don't have any real friends.
I hate it when they have to rush these things.
Whoever knew there was so much corn this close to DC?
To see my dad.
He lives up here?
He and my mom can't live in the same state.
Seriously?
I mean, they can legally.
But they won't.
Shattered his pelvis.
I was in the FBI at the time.
So was I. But I volunteered anyway.
Dameran was top of his high-school class.
Did a year at Purdue before he lost a deferment.
Maybe he gets out of Walter Reed, tries to restart the life he dreamed about in college, but it's tough.
He gets a dead-end desk at the Department Of Agriculture, ends up pushing pencils at the World Bank.
Not a bad KGB target.
What the hell's going on with the debris pickup?
We've got a new facility up there, courtesy of the Reagan military budget.
Thank God, because this place is falling apart.
But still, moving's a bitch.
Well, we're here to help, so I'll go check on the north dock.
They split up for a while, like a few months ago.
Th-they're pretty private about stuff like that.
I mean, I thought maybe one of them was having an affair or something.
I'd just really love to, like, know.
Oh, this is me.
Thanks for making this trip fly by.
It always feels better to have someone to talk to, doesn't it?
Yeah, totally.
You know, if you want to hang out with other people who get it.
Can I help you?
I'm Jackie, with the moving company.
I need to find the CNC cylindrical grinder.
They want extra padding in the crate.
It's in Annapolis.
It was moved yesterday by the DOD.
Yeah, I mean, I don't think we need to bother your supervisor.
Is there another CNC on site here that maybe I could measure, or...?
Not that exact one.
I mean, there are other machines.
Which way is the dry dock?
This way.
You know, the new plant is gonna be closer to my house.
And I'm gonna get to see my kids more.
T-this is them.
That's Lucas... and Ryan... and that's Danny.
They expect me home for supper.
I can't see any reason why you'd miss it, can you?
Let's go.
Aunt Helen?
I gave you what you wanted.
Please.
Can I see your pictures again?
I'm Paige.
Elizabeth's daughter.
I don't understand.
We need to initiate a covert investigation into one of your employees.
Uh, no, w-we have an event today with our new chief executive.
Is Mr. Dameran in trouble?
At this juncture, we're just... gathering information.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Is he on a group or a team you can call upstairs for a meeting?
Dameran called in sick today.
He'll stay quiet.
Better than having him disappear.
Where are you going?
You know where.
Why don't you put that rifle down?
We can talk.
Why don't you tell me about it?
I saw the real enemy... and it's right here.
What was the favor you wanted to ask?
Emmett and I wrote a letter to our son in case anything ever happens to us.
Who we are, and... where we come from.
You can understand that, right?
I'm glad you're safe.
And if it weren't for you, he would have killed a lot of people.
If it weren't for you, not me.
No, I'm just doing my job.
They say they want to give me a medal.
All my life, they tell us terrible things about you.
Then I meet you.
I'm proud of you, Stan.
I love you, Nina.
Here, dad!
Hey, I'm just gonna find Polaris tonight.
The North Star.
Yeah, I have heard of it.
It stays in the same place all year no matter what time, and all the other stars rotate around it.
She had to stay late at school.
Is that right?
Yeah, but don't be mad.
- About what?
Road Track says the Z/28 is front-runner for car of the year.
- Good evening, Philip.
It's Aunt Helen.
I just wanted to tell you Paige came to visit today.
She should be on her way home by now.
Thank you for letting me know.
Come in, please.
The state mandates these visits.
It's the only way to know how he's acclimating.
It's so soon.
A child's adjustment starts on day one, especially for trauma victims.
Oh, we adore him.
What is it about him?
He's amazing with the kids.
Gets my son to do his homework.
I didn't know that.
We had to do something to help.
Even if it's only a year until he goes to college.
The thing he needs most now is to feel safe.
That's all kids really want.
Would it be okay if I had a few minutes alone with him?
Well, it's super-competitive.
You have to prepare a subject to debate, and I'm doing the ethical ramifications of test-tube babies.
Good luck with that.
Aunt Helen called to say her daughter came to visit.
I'm sorry.
This is the most... irresponsible thing you have ever done.
I-I don't even know what to say.
Watch it, young lady.
I am sorry we don't have more of a family, but your mother and I have worked hard to create this one.
Good.
I love you, Nina.
I love you, Nina.
Are you sleeping?
The Advocacy Center is committed to giving you anything that you need.
You know, you're entitled to a leave of absence from school.
No, I'll go.
No one expects you to.
My parents would.
This is gonna be a process, Jared.
Healing takes time.
Especially when there are no answers.
I've had this ear infection.
Yeah.
None of this is your fault.
When he gets in there, he feeds, off chaos, strife, and pain.
I don't care.
My girl back home loves them.
What has a neck, but no head?
Your mother.
A bottle.
What the hell.
What has a neck but no head?
Her little knives.
Daggers.
I know what they are.
Physical representation of her tails.
However the hell that works.
Maybe you'd like to do some reading on it.
I know it's the strongest.
Unfortunately, I don't know what you're referring to.
You'll talk.
They always talk.
This looks just like me.
The same backwards five that the oni put on us was on the wall.
- What is it?
- My dad.
Kira, did you bring it?
You going to tell me what it is?
Are you okay?
Stiles did this?
He wanted the last kaiken.
I've kept this near me ever since your friend disappeared.
Mom, you need to talk to us, about everything.
Where did you get this?
Is it Grandma?
Hayes, a little help here.
Five crates apples.
There's only three left here.
Okay, four crates apples.
Hayes, come on!
If that's you, then you'd have to be like 90 years old.
The blade was shattered the last time it was used.
When was that?
1943.
Where did it come from?
Allison's family has a certain history of violence.
I didn't know if she could be trusted.
When I was a grad student, my passion project, actually more like an obsession, was trying to dig up the truth on Oak Creek.
It's how I met your mother, Kira.
So, where did the nogitsune come from?
Isn't it obvious yet?
It came from me.
Guys, keep your voices down.
Michio.
A baseball, Noshiko?
I can feel your glare on the back of my head, Satomi.
Should I give some back?
I know you get migraines at least once a month.
I prefer to suffer.
You think rules are for the obedience of fools and cowards.
The young fox always knows the rules so she can break them.
The older, wiser animal learns the exceptions to the rules.
Listen, you two, all we have to do is stay quiet.
Michio, get back.
What the hell was that?
The MPs are coming.
Somebody lose something?
There were supplies stolen off the truck last night.
Anybody here got any ideas what happened?
I want that window fixed.
We're not gonna look now?
Inspection in the morning, Private.
Or as the Americans say, you reap what you sow.
Kira, I need your help on this.
There isn't much time.
And this is something that needs to be done in the daylight.
Not until you tell us everything.
Wolves and foxes tend not to get along.
Not just in fables and stories.
But allies, however unlikely, should be welcomed.
Especially in times of war.
Sorry, but I can't let you walk out with this.
It's way above the legal voltage limit.
I only use it for hunting.
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure you could use it to jump-start a 747.
This property belongs to me and the charges were dropped.
I said I'll take care of it.
The specialist I saw in LA told me the thing that every doctor says when he's trying to avoid a lawsuit.
I knew they were similar.
And I'm guessing this isn't possible?
But why this trick?
You don't look like a man who gives up hope easily.
But Stiles might.
And others severely dead.
That's why I need the two of you.
I need people who are experienced in this kind of thing.
I need you to help me stop him.
And by stop him, you mean trap him.
Why do I like you when you're acting tough?
Maybe because you want me to be a fighter.
No, I like my handsome medic.
Don't like him too much.
Your handsome medic is getting worried.
I think you need to ease up on all the stuff you're taking off the truck, Noshiko.
Especially medical supplies.
People are starting to notice.
So what if they notice?
You're quoting Japanese proverbs to me?
The stake that sticks out gets hammered down.
They'll punish everyone and get them to turn you in.
That's how they do it in the Army.
Okay, I get it.
I can be pretty sly myself.
I thought you liked it when I'm tough.
I like chocolate more.
I'm trying to tell you.
You're trying to stall.
When the sun goes down, the oni are gonna come after him again, aren't they?
Your friend's gone, Scott.
I don't think you know that for sure.
But he is nogitsune now.
He is void.
Can you call them off?
When you hear the rest of the story, you won't want me to.
This is everything non-lethal I could find.
Take all of it.
What's the plan here?
Where else has Stiles been showing up?
School, the hospital.
He's getting us to repeat the same moves.
So, what do we do?
Scott's working on them right now, with Kira.
It wouldn't be the first wolf to run from a fox.
Apparently I'm carrying the lightsaber.
Dad, you and Derek hit Eichen House.
Making sure you have a few lethal options just in case?
I like to prepare for the worst.
Rhys and I found ways to see each other.
He was being transferred to North Africa in a few weeks.
I was teaching him some French.
Coup de foudre.
But the literal translation is "bolt of lightning."
Embrasse-moi.
I don't remember teaching you that.
That one's self-taught.
I figured it might come in handy.
So, embrasse-moi.
Kiss me.
We watched Merrick and Hayes talking with the camp doctor.
They were whispering, talking quickly.
Mom, what are you doing?
How did you do that?
It's one of our talents.
Something as bad as the flu.
Or something like...
I saw those boxes.
I know I took a bunch of stuff off that truck, but I didn't take any M B.
Dr. Liston was using Merrick and Hayes to sell medicine on the black market.
You want to talk to them?
I know how you feel...
They won't listen to us.
Why should they?
I have a way to make them listen.
We want the doctor!
And maybe they'll be polite enough to ask me if I have any last words.
You know what those last words are gonna be?
"I had help."
So maybe we throw you out there now and provide a little distraction, huh?
They've got a few pipes, some rocks and sticks.
I yelled for them to stop.
I'd never seen anger like that.
It was a living, breathing thing.
Now I knew why Satomi was always trying to keep quiet.
Why she got migraines once a month, and why she was always at the game of Go.
It kept her calm.
She was bitten.
Bitten werewolves have a harder time suppressing their anger.
One unexpected flare-up and they could lose all control.
You know what, I don't know how you guys do it.
You're all so strong.
You're fearless.
Hell, you even manage to keep your grades up.
I am failing Econ.
Is that Coach's class?
Well, I'll have a talk with him.
I don't know if Isaac is dying right now.
I don't know if I made a mistake with Scott.
I don't know what my dad is thinking.
You know what's funny?
You sound just like a cop.
You're gonna be okay.
What's that?
Someone's breaking into my house.
The gunfire nearly killed me.
I don't know how many bullets made their way into my body, but I fought every one of them.
It left my body so weak, my heartbeat so slow it appeared as though I was dead.
His screams could be heard throughout Eichen House, echoing through every room, every hallway.
He died in agony.
The doctor, it seems, had also sold the morphine.
Merrick and Hayes were given the task of getting rid of all the bodies, both American and Japanese-American.
They were transferring Dr. Liston out as well, stationing him somewhere else.
They were covering it up.
I wanted the soldiers and the administration of the camp to be punished for their crime.
They were going to burn me with the others.
I couldn't fight back with my body weakened and still healing.
I could barely move.
I was going to die.
But I could not die knowing they would get away.
So I called out to our ancestors for kitsune-tsuki.
Possession by a fox spirit.
But calling on a trickster spirit is a dangerous thing.
They can have a very dark sense of humor.
Because while the nogitsune did come to possess someone, it wasn't me.
What the hell.
But it was too late.
Rhys!
What did it do?
It brought chaos, strife and more pain than you can imagine.
Coup de foudre.
The literal translation is "a bolt of lightning."
In French, it can also mean "love at first sight."
But a bolt of lightning happens to be exactly what we need right now.
For what?
Excising the nogitsune from Rhys' body shattered the katana.
But you can put it back together.
Do you trust me?
What is all this?
You think there's any reason my name's on the king?
It's not a message from Stiles.
This couldn't sound any more like a trap.
All we need to do is come up with a new punch line.
The sun is setting, Sheriff.
What do you have in mind?
Go ahead.
What if I don't want it?
You need it.
You see?
It gives you balance.
And maybe seek out a wolf to help you.
You didn't tell us anything.
You agree with this?
Sometimes, history does repeat itself, Scott.
Only if you don't learn.
But sometimes even then, fate conspires against you.
I'll take it somewhere safe.
That's not what I'm worried about.
History has not done well with making children into killers.
These children played their part in it long before we came back to Beacon Hills.
I buried the jar deep within the roots of the Nemeton.
It was their sacrifice that brought its power back.
They let the demon out of its cage.
Hi, Dad.
Why are you whispering?
This is my real hair, Bonnie.
- There's not much to tell.
- I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Oh, honey, it's great that you're concerned about your mother, but you can't make this decision based on how she might feel.
May I help you?
No, that's okay.
I'll come back when you're not pissed off.
What can I do you for?
Well, when last here, I failed to mention, um, certain facts...
- So do I. It's weird, huh?
- Oh, my God.
- I'm your daughter.
Yeah, yeah, I got that.
- You're the reason I'm short.
- My Mom actually found you.
- So she's alive?
- Yeah, of course.
Well, if you knew her when I knew her, that is not a given.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, stupid question.
Listen, I don't want anything.
I was just thinking that maybe we could... get to know each other.
Yeah, that-that's not gonna happen.
- It's not?
- I can't do it, honey.
Just so you know, I turned out to be a wonderful person!
Got my temper.
Mom, please, can I just have five minutes where we make it about me?
- All I'm saying is...
I'm officially an orphan.
Little Orphan Christy.
- I get nothing from him!
Do you know where my Mother is?
Because I really need to talk to her about something important!
We were tossing the football, I told him to go long and... neither one of us saw the tree.
- I am?
- You're here, aren't you?
Just go with it.
Thank you.
How's everything going here?
- Yeah, I love it.
If I wasn't so busy, I'd do it every week.
Every week?
Okay.
They do it every month!
Whatever.
Wow, my granddaughter's a joy.
Hang on.
I want you to buy me an ice cream cone.
Two scoops.
- How about a pony?
Is it good?
Really?
No, I was just trying to make a connection.
Listen, Christy, I'm really sorry about how I acted back at the garage.
Geez, I-I don't know what to say.
What kind of a man abandons his newborn baby on Christmas Eve?
Well, in my defense, God did that to Jesus.
- Good-bye.
- No, no, I'm sorry, I'm...
The answer to your question is that I was a very stupid... very selfish, very frightened young man, and I'm not that man anymore.
And then after a few years, I had to stop.
I don't know... it was too painful.
And by painful, I mean shameful.
- So... now what?
- Why not?
- You really did a number on my Mom.
I don't see you and I having any kind of relationship until you make things right with her.
She's living on my couch.
So chemo's kind of like talking to you?
Oh, I'm sorry if you find my desperate fight for life boring.
Apology accepted.
What are you talking about?
I want to cut the son of a bitch from throat to scroat!
Oh, Bonnie, you have to let that go.
Oh, Marjorie, I most certainly do not.
Well, it's your choice, but holding on to anger is like drinking poison and expecting it to kill the other person.
Why do I even talk to you?
You finally have a good relationship with your daughter.
If you stay angry at her father, it could ruin that.
I hate you.
- Stop that.
Love you, love you, love you.
Seriously, I will wring whatever life you have left out of you!
Coming!
Gee, I was starting to think you'd never come back.
- You're losing your hair.
It's not lost, it's just in my ears.
Can I, uh, get you something to drink?
- Needed a little liquid courage, did you?
If you like, I could tie it in a knot for you.
- I know what happened was...
You left me with a one-day-old baby and 18 bucks in my jeans.
- Believe me, when we broke up...
- There was no breaking up!
Breaking up is fighting and splitting up your albums and maybe one hot, angry good-bye bang!
What you did was abandon me when I was the most vulnerable I've ever been in my entire life!
- I'm-I'm not defending it...
- Yeah, because you can't!
- Shut up!
But if you hurt that little girl, I will hunt you down and I will kill you and everything you love.
I think I just peed a little.
Well, I think I found what the problem is.
What is it?
Your engine has like, uh, 800,000 miles on it.
I'll keep working on it.
- This is nice, spending time with you.
- Yeah, it is.
- Is it okay if I call you Dad?
- I don't see why not.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I just rang the bell a little.
- What are you waiting for?
- You got to give me some time.
I gave you 35 years!
Call me Papa.
God, this is so sad.
It scares me, the way your mind works.
- You expecting anybody?
What do you think?
- What do I think of what?
- Hey, sis.
- Where's your wife?
- She's still processing the information.
At her sister's in Albuquerque.
How about we take it for a ride and you get to know your brothers better?
Let go of the anger, 'cause it's poisoning you.
Another round, doubles, straight up.
Table six is still waiting on their dessert.
I got a table full of firemen drinking bourbon like it's coming out of a hose.
- Firemen?
They should've let you burn.
Thank you for bringing the medicine that alleviates my pain.
- No.
- You guys have fun.
- Hey, wait, don't go.
- Feel it?
- No.
Feel it!
All right, then.
I'm the one helping you.
At the restaurant!
- Do you remember which restaurant?
- I do not.
I'll, uh... write it down for you.
I'm gonna go.
- You already ran that line on me.
Actually, quite well.
Just... please, stay for a little while.
- Five minutes.
I was making out with you by the dumpsters.
You're charming enough.
Waitress by day, detective by night!
Can't really masturbate to Socrates.
Do the other firemen make fun of you?
- They call me the professor.
What?
I do.
Okay, you get two more minutes.
Explain how you go from that to fireman.
I had no choice.
After the mortgage meltdown, the philosophy business went right to hell.
Can I kiss you?
Look, I think I gave you the wrong impression in the parking lot.
I'm really not that kind of girl, so...
Slut.
Oh... we got a tip the health department is gonna inspect the restaurant tomorrow.
- Took forever.
- Almost as long as this lie.
Because your panties are in your purse.
- An incredible guy.
'Cause I met him at 9:00 and had my feet behind my ears at midnight.
And...?
- Tell me about him.
- Ooh... where do I start?
- He's a fireman.
And when his pants came down, oh, Mom, you could play horseshoes on that thing.
Back to like.
- So when are you seeing him again?
Did you steal something from his apartment?
Who does that?
No one.
- Continue.
It was a one-night stand, end of story.
You know, you're being sarcastic, but my probation officer says the same thing!
The French call the orgasm "la petite mort."
Well, then you're a serial killer.
- This is nice.
- You know what would be nicer?
I told you I'm not gonna do that.
So, you don't drink, you don't get high... are you, like, a Mormon or something?
- Don't take this the wrong way, but bourbon and weed is for babies.
Oh, my heart is filling with love.
Really?
Good for you.
I admire that.
Facing life on life's terms is a warrior's path.
Well, I don't think I'm a warrior.
You don't say.
A hummingbird doesn't regret yesterday or worry about tomorrow 'cause that doesn't actually exist, except in our minds.
You know, a small TV in here wouldn't be the worst idea in the world.
- I like you.
- I think you like everything right now.
Be right back.
After the meeting, I'll be over by the cookies to answer your questions.
- Oh, where did you get certified?
- Not that question.
Oh, you know, I'm good.
What about the drunk fireman?
- My name is Mary...
- Yeah, yeah, we know your name!
You-you sure you don't want to tell everybody you spent last night staring down the business end of a bong?
- Where he belongs, Mary!
Christy, you need to be honest with this group.
You were the one who encouraged me to see him.
And the Aryan nation guys really don't like him.
And I just wanted you to get laid.
Oh,mygod!
Top o' the morning to you!
And who's this enchantress in flaid plannel?
- Plaid flannel?
- This is my Mom, Bonnie.
You can't just say Bonnie?
What the hell are you doing with a fire truck?
Come inside.
Everybody go back to bed!
There's no a fire.
I'll just give him a flier.
What's going on?
He looks drunk.
Violet, please take your brother back to bed.
Come on, Roscoe.
Remember when Mom was drunk and we drew mustaches on her?
- Mom, you're sleeping with me.
- I knew that.
Okay, help me out here.
Keeps it in his shoe?
- You think?
And I know that it's not good for me, but I don't want to go back to being alone.
She is the strongest person I know.
If I had a guy like this, I'd be robbing banks and shooting heroin into my eyeballs to keep our love alive.
- It's a red light.
- You're in a fire truck!
I'm waiting for him to get out of the shower.
You think he's using my loofah?
Mom.
- I know.
- No, there won't.
- Yeah, probably not.
Keep walking, Mom!
Hey, uh, got some coffee here for you.
Thanks for bringing the truck back.
- Christy, I might have a problem.
Oh, believe me, you're a huge problem, it's just, uh...
I'm sorry, I don't think I can do this anymore.
I could lose everything.
What if I cleaned up my act?
- Are you willing to do that?
- I'm willing to lie about it.
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
You're still my hummingbird warrior.
If you ever change your mind, you've got my number.
Yeah. 911.
With each breath you take you release the bond of the past.
Good, Sabrina.
Very nice, Nadia.
Namaste, Guru Dutta.
How long?
Eric.
Can you repeat the question?
How long have you been sick?
Saw the first signs last month.
When you were in St. Petersburg.
St. fucking Petersburg, Eric?
You know how I hate the Russian people.
But only because I'm not well.
Tara met the true death.
I felt it last night when I was in Morocco.
I like the bucket game.
What is wrong with you?
You are Eric fucking Northman.
You don't give up, you fight.
Fight's over, Pam.
This can't all be about Sylvie.
Bravo, Mr. Northman.
- Who the fuck are you?
What size shoe do you wear?
Could have been friends.
Circumstances are what they are.
Then get a room with a window and let the moon shine in.
I take it you've both heard of the Yakonomo Corporation?
The Authority and Yakonomo Corp. have joined forces in the development and bringing to market of a synthetic human blood substitute drink.
Sounds delicious.
I've tasted it and you would be correct.
It's no Sylvie, but it gets the job done.
With Tru Blood, mainstreaming is going to become a reality.
And everyone lived bored and suicidally ever after.
Stop being cute.
Many might appreciate your smile but I can assure you the Yakonomo Corporation will not.
Nor will the Authority.
It is my job to make sure you understand this.
I understand.
Eric.
Mr. Northman.
Go fuck yourself.
Very well.
I'll make sure all the interested parties are aware of your answer.
That woman was Authority, Eric, and you just told her to go fuck herself.
Bring her with if you have to, but let's go.
I am as big a fan of the French vagina as you are, Eric, but come back to Earth.
She's just a human.
You do not fall in line with Miss Flanagan or the Authority.
You fall in line with me.
Shit.
Goddamn it, Sookie.
I know she came here.
I can fucking smell her.
Werewolves are the best trackers on the planet.
I covered our tracks, Sookie.
Is it too late for me to talk you out of this?
How come you can't feel me anymore?
I thought once I'd had your blood, it was forever.
At that camp where I fed all those vampires I was completely drained, Sookie.
Jessica and James may have saved my life by transfusing me but the Bill Compton that I am today has nothing to do with the Bill Compton whose blood flows through your veins.
So you're saying you get a clean slate then?
I have to live with the memories of what I've done to you forever.
I can't acquit myself of any of it.
Good.
If we're gonna go through with this plan then you're gonna have to take my blood or I won't be able to help you.
I have a boyfriend.
Do you think Rocky's okay?
Yes, Wade, I do.
Do you think my mom's okay?
I really hope so.
Do you think we're gonna be okay?
Do you wanna know a secret?
You and me we made out once.
Really?
We really made out?
This is the best news I've heard in a while.
- Don't tell him we were just about to--
Don't worry, I won't.
Who did this to you?
- I don't know, everyone, the whole town.
- Even Rocky was part of it.
- Don't get him in trouble.
Son, we're all in trouble.
Who are they after?
They're after anyone and anything that's different than they are.
And what if that was the last thing you were ever gonna do?
Because life is supposed to add up to something not be some half-eaten slice of pizza.
Reverend, they had Jesuses everywhere.
What good did it do them?
What good would not having had it done them?
I don't know.
At least they wouldn't have been blind to the fact that death was coming.
Now, look here, this ain't the kind of thing I say in front of a congregation but since it's just you and me right now death is a dark and blinding motherfucker whether you see it coming or you don't.
Reverend, I am so sorry to interrupt, but she's freaking out again.
- Well, that was awkward.
- Yeah, it was.
The reverend's got his hands full.
You're awful douchey for a vampire, aren't you?
Just trying to make conversation.
Well, ain't this fucking perfect?
What are you all doing out here?
Taking our town back.
You are, huh?
- You told them?
- Damn right he told us.
I knew there was something off about you.
Now I know what it is.
You're a cop, Kenya, I'm your mayor.
Translation, you black, he's white.
- Yeah, we're safer, all right.
The people have spoken.
I'm sorry, y'all but I belong here.
Yeah, I've been thinking.
We ever make it through this would you ever consider maybe having a baby with me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
I know you can't make babies, but we could adopt.
I just feel, with everything going on a man ain't nothing without a family.
What?
You were when I met you.
Fuck being modern.
Jason and I are in the middle of a fight, so fuck off.
Vince and all his yahoos broke into the station, stole all our guns.
Oh, shit.
Do you wanna tell him, or should I?
Tell me what?
It's Pollyanna shit like that that makes me hate you.
But I'll bust out the pharmacy if you wanna join.
Now, I know what I was escaping from but what's on your mind that you want off?
Just Jessica's shit, I guess.
Any particular kind of Jessica's shit?
Well. there's a longer version of this conversation but I'm not really in the mood.
Remember what it was the last pill you took?
And lets your consciousness ride that wave.
You can't make a Tuinal.
Sure you can.
Before you know it, you're gonna be riding that wave like you did back in your lovechild days.
- They've got vampires protecting them.
I have to eat every hour on the hour.
What happens if we don't find anybody?
We'll bring one of them hunting with us.
What, like trail mix?
Now, which one of you thinks she's Harry Potter?
I'm all ears if you got a better one.
I didn't mean it literally.
I know you didn't, but when we say stuff we can't decide how people are gonna take it.
All I'm doing tonight is fulfilling my purpose.
Let's just hope the bad guys take the bait.
If everything goes as planned and they take you to where they're holding the others want me to bring Alcide when I come find you?
Hell, yeah, bring Alcide.
Bring anybody who's willing to help.
There's a whole lot of us who are gonna need rescuing.
You love him?
That would be none of your business, William Compton.
If we're to be friends, Sookie, we should be able to talk about things like this.
He wants kids.
Ain't that what you want?
I really do.
But there's something deep down and I've never said this before, even to myself.
I'm afraid that I don't love him as much as he loves me.
And I know I should because Alcide is decent and handsome and grounded and he's good, you know?
But when we tell each other "I love you" I can hear it in his voice, and I can hear it in his thoughts.
He means it more than I do.
I know and it makes me feel so effing rotten inside. I don't know how much longer I can take it.
Well, love isn't always equal, Sookie.
I'd take him loving me a little less just the same.
Hey, this is Sookie.
Listen, we went over to your house and the door was open, and no one was home.
Now I'm really starting to worry, so when you get this, would you please call me?
Where's the mayor, y'all?
Well, he flew away.
What can I do you for?
Which one's it gonna be?
Enough of this shit.
Shut up, the both of you.
You made Hoyt leave me.
You drove him away from his mama.
Rocky!
Come on.
Food.
Making the water all choppy.
Molly making waves.
Fuck the past.
Especially since you don't know if you got a future.
Now is all that matters.
Where the hell are they?
If I didn't know better, I would say that you were looking forward to this.
It's just them not taking the bait is a little insulting, is all.
I thought I smelled special.
Have you ever been to Six Flags?
I cannot say that I've had the pleasure.
- Didn't they close that down?
You knew they were gonna drop you, you just didn't know when.
That's exactly what this feels like.
You should try going to war.
Yeah, I suppose it is.
- What of, the camera?
Darling, we discussed this.
Yes, of course I am, darling.
Then why do you need the photograph?
So that I can look at you, and your mother and your brother when I'm feeling lonesome for you.
But it'll be a lot better than not being able to see you at all.
- May I ask your name?
Well, I have only so many tins, you see, and they're quite expensive.
Well, I will gladly pay the cost.
- This one's for you to keep.
- In three, two, one, freeze.
Lovely.
Thank you, sir.
ls she asleep?
Finally, yes.
- I'm so sorry about before.
When the good Lord made us, Willa, he gave us reflexes for a reason.
Even water knows to jump off a griddle when it's hot.
You hungry?
- I can wait until tomorrow.
Are you sure?
I moved to this town after the worst period of my life.
Neighbors and congregates, they'd come by with casseroles or pies, or just to check up on me.
But you see, I would pretend I wasn't there.
L'd have the curtains drawn or the television off.
And I'd be cowering in a corner trying to hold my breath for fear that someone would talk to me.
I was low.
This church right next door.
But what no one seems to understand is that that woman saved me every bit as much as I saved her.
You done?
You know that there's no liquor in this house.
But to Lettie Mae, all you look like now is a bottle of Captain Morgan.
I can't have you around here no more.
She manipulated you once and she'll do it again.
Okay, I understand.
Good luck.
Hey, man.
Lafayette?
Let me fix your neck, and then I have to go.
Okay, I'm stopping.
- Look, I-- - l'm sorry.
I must've misread you or something.
No, no, you didn't misread anything.
It's just you know, I'm with Jessica.
All right.
I gets it.
Good night.
Nighty-night, lover.
Eric?
Jesus fucking Christ, Pam.
- Now what?
- I wouldn't, Mr. Northman.
You're more outnumbered than you're aware.
So very pretty.
Who sent you?
We are here at the Yakonomo Corporation's behest.
Well, then, tell them I understand.
They made their point.
I will be more careful in the future, I promise.
You have a choice to make, Mr. Northman.
One of them has to die.
Okay, what do you want?
Money?
I got money.
I'm so sorry, Eric.
Kill me.
The Authority wants you alive, I'm afraid.
Pam.
Pam lives.
Did you contract the virus on purpose?
On purpose, no.
But did I go about my dealings with a devil-may-care attitude?
Absolutely.
You can't give up, Eric.
With an ample blood supply vampires are living longer and longer with this disease.
Please.
I will help keep you well until--
Why?
Do you regret the choice you made that night?
I made the only choice I could.
Then don't make me watch this.
Goddamn you.
For more than a thousand years, the world has been my oyster.
And it still can be.
I'll do anything.
I've lost my taste for oysters, Pam.
You should go.
Sarah Newlin.
What about her?
What if I told you Jason Steakhouse let her live?
I have to imagine she's in hiding somewhere.
Hold your breath with me, Naomi.
We breathe together we climax together.
Namaste.
Oh, Naomi, Noemi, Noemi.
I have made it my life's work to steer lost souls onto the path.
Not once did it occur to me that along would come a student who could so wholly and completely set me free.
You make me whole and free too, guru.
I walked into this institute five months ago a clueless Christian woman named Naomi who believed that life on Earth was just an audition to get into heaven.
I never knew that life on Earth could be heaven.
There is no heaven, Noemi.
There is only the now.
And now, be a doll and go pick out a nice bottle of red from the cellar while I draw us an Ayurvedic foaming bath, will you?
Yes, guru.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Do you know this woman?
Her name is Sarah Newlin.
We have reason to believe she is here.
Where is she?
This I will not tell you.
How very unhelpful of you.
Sarah Newlin!
Sookie, human.
Fuck you!
- That all of them?
Do not fucking talk, all right?
You swallow any blood?
Tell me I ain't good enough to protect her, and this is what you come up with?
It was her idea, Alcide.
I've known her long enough not to change her mind.
Andy, behind the tree.
No, no, no!
You sure, Sook?
I've been down that road before.
Ambulance.
You pulled the trigger, Lou.
I told you life wasn't gonna be the same.
I was up for re-election as social chair of our local realtors group.
The vote was tonight.
Why did I beg Mitchell to introduce me to this developer?
Hello?
Um, so, you hear anything, or...
What's going o-- what's going on?
Sorry to have to tell you that in private.
Never met Art Wagner.
They took away his realtor's license after Gategate.
Okay, enough history, "done-for."
Fork over the hardware.
Gil, as my predecessor told me, respect the office, respect the medallion.
Ooh, shiny.
How often do you clean this thing?
Every time I shower.
That is not respecting the medall-- So, after we pick up my allergy medication, you drop Manny and I at the museum.
Why do you even have to go?
Ay, other mothers are going to the field trip, too.
Don't talk like that.
I hate crowded elevators.
Only one thing worse -- when they stop and you get trapped.
Actually, there's one thing even worse than that.
Getting trapped with him.
But for whatever reason, he has the knack for showing up when I'm at my absolute worst.
Be right back.
Here, let me help you.
Maybe we should help someone else.
Who's next?
A D.P.
So he can only meet with us this morning.
Is -- is there any way you could pick Lily up from school?
Do you remember when we used to call you "little rusty"?
I was 8, and I can still cancel this meeting.
What is this?
I'm sweating off weight for my wrestling match.
I slept in this.
Does this have anything to do with why we're out of plastic wrap?
Ooh, got any pointers for him?
Do you girls have to move that now?
Ugh, your daughter's a parakeet.
Careful.
Okay, let's just put this down for a second.
You know, you'll just be a little late for school.
Just got real, didn't it?
What's happening?
We should probably cancel our meeting and pick Lily up ourselves, huh?
Probably?
Yeah, it's the right thing to do... even though it's like a 1% chance of her actually catching anything and a 100% chance of us freaking her out.
Well, now, wait.
Are we being selfish here, Cam?
Thank you.
Nope, she does not need the stress, Cam.
No!
Hey, buddy!
Starting to sound natural, right?
No matter what happens, I couldn't be prouder.
Thanks, dad.
That may be the best part about being a parent.
Whatever's going on in your personal life, when your kid's happy, you're happy.
A happy kid is like an antidepressant, but a natural one, not the kind your husband has to find in your jewelry drawer.
Enough said about that!
Hey, Gil.
Our kids are wrestling each other.
- Are you kidding?
- Nope!
There's my little bra-snapper right there.
He's a beast, man.
Hey, did you ever hear about those illegal baby-fighting rings they got in the border?
That's not a real thing.
That never happened!
Wish me luck.
Thanks, dad.
Also, I'd like to revise what I said to you in the car about biting.
Manny, they have everything here-- the rainforest experience, the hurricane booth, discovering the body -- we have that one in Colombia, too, but -- but a different kind.
Then walk softer.
Hand them this, it'll stick with me forever.
That's what happened to Mumbles.
Hey, Manny, come with us.
Let's go, Mumbles.
One time!
Let's go.
What -- forever?
What happened to him?
He didn't used to be that self-conscious before High School.
He used to go around in his poncho, play the pan flute.
Ay, I miss my little old Manny.
Manny, you care too much about what other people think!
I know that some of the mothers here want to make fun of me because of my accent and my bouncy bosom.
Okay, she's not leaving.
Why do you keep calling it a "she"?
Well, because "he"s don't look at me like that.
My God, is she gonna sleep all day long?
Okay, that, coming from you?
Playing...?
Playing... what?
And you ate our only power bar.
Well, that's probably what attracted it!
Oh, no!
The -- the director of photography we met with this morning -- he's turning us down.
Who is your wedding photographer -- Mr. Peanut?
It's a director of --
Jim Perlowe, this is my sister, Claire Dunphy.
Listen, I went by the construction site this morning, and those condos are gonna be fantastic -- assuming, of course, you get the right closets and blinds.
Appears the meeting has already started, so, okay!
- Shall we?
Hey, sleepy!
Yeah.
Do you want to lie down with me, daddy?
Oh, honey, the day I answer no to that question is today.
Where are you going?
I got to call daddy.
You start with measurements, maybe.
Hey, Cam, what's up?
You have to warn Claire.
Daddy, this game is mean.
Yeah, I think I know.
What is going on with you?
Okay, so, you know how you've been scratching your head?
Um, so, Lily brought home lice from school.
What?
Yeah, and, actually, I would've told you, but Cam thought that maybe --
You let me walk around with insects gnawing on my skull, and you said nothing?
No, listen, you -- what kind of monster puts their self-interest ahead of telling another human being that they are going to get a parasite infestation?
Oh, I think we're way past handshakes, huh?
Manny, stop disrespecting your ancestors.
No, don't give me that attitude.
No, I -- why is your face red?
What?
Manny, where have you been all day?
She was just there.
I think she's hiding.
Uh yeah, maybe.
But the important thing is that I have fun out there, right?
Okay, let's go over this again, 'cause I feel like you're not listening.
I need you to win.
Hey, Jay.
Hey, Luke.
All right.
What the hell was that?
The guy that took your necklace, right?
I'm just glad I don't have to help you with the clasp again.
Jay, are you crying?
You see that little Petunia he's wrestling?
You know Gil's dad?
I know he always sees me at my worst.
I really want this win, Phil.
It's emasculating, you know?
I mean, it's not a feeling a man should have.
Lily got it at school.
- What?
- Nothing.
Lily got lice from someone.
But who wants to pretend to be a dog and ride in the car?
And remember -- we're gonna keep our head outside the window.
All right, the match is starting.
I feel that metal now in my mouth, like you were saying.
What if he loses?
The kid needs to know we support him no matter what.
Mom, you're unbelievable.
Ay, that's sweet, but I know I look terrible.
You come down on me for being self-conscious, then you run and hide because your face is red.
You're right.
I keep blaming the high-school boys for making you self-conscious, and you're taking after me.
We can assign blame when we're safely behind our tinted windows.
It was the bravest thing my mom had ever done.
Hey, everybody!
Aww, it's so pretty.
Hey, Manny, nice top.
Uh, but my shoes!
What about 'em, Pink Top?
It was the bravest thing he has ever done.
They call me "Pink Top."
My hero.
Pink top.
How could I do that?
My dad never missed an opportunity to let me know when I disappointed him, and I do it to my grandkid.
That was wrong.
Forget about those jerks.
We couldn't be anything but proud of you, just like I'm super proud of your mom.
Let's repair this one first.
We just don't want you to beat yourself up because you lost.
He's burying his feelings.
It's all in the DNA, Phil.
It's how men work.
Or used to work.
Maybe those thuggish Pritchett genes got mixed with more evolved Dunphy genes, resulting in a more elevated human being.
Would it kill you to call me your kid, Jay?
I have an idea.
Give it a second to warm up.
You just attacked him, didn't you?
I'll get it.
Honey, I take back everything I ever said about this stupid invention.
Well, come on in.
Just want to say I'm sorry, "Doofy."
And yet you're still call-- what your kid did today was amazing.
No hard feelings, right?
Hey, Cam, hold off on that thing for a second.
Lily, honey?
Only my niece.
If there's one thing she loves, it's piggy-back.
Who's this man?
You can call me Uncle Gil!
Uncle Gil!
You two look great together!
It no longer matters, I have your beautiful brain.
The next time your lips touch Emma Swan's, all of her magic will be taken.
Would you mind holding on to this for a bit longer?
- I will get your heart!
A gift.
From sister to sister.
What are you doing here?
I saw your tree, and I thought you could use something better.
Red apples are so sickly sweet, don't you think?
That's not yours.
Right, because I got everything, and you have nothing.
If you want your superpower to be envy, go right ahead.
With every advantage, you still turn your back on every opportunity for happiness.
She gave you away.
You have no idea what really happened.
That's exactly what's going to hurt you.
You didn't come here to give me sisterly advice.
He's taking your heart.
Stop right there.
You know this arrow never misses its mark.
If I could stand down, I would.
And who is this?
Please.
Daddy!
And stop.
Daddy, help!
Go to friar tuck.
What happened?
Was anyone hurt?
Gold's taken it for her, and since she hasn't crushed it and killed me, that means she needs it for something far worse.
That's why I need your help.
What do you have here?
Why on earth or any realm would I help you?
She has your Rumple, and unless you help me, you may never see him again.
So, I've been trying to match the ingredients that Zelena's been collecting to whatever spell she intends to cast.
It would really help if I knew what is so special about your heart.
Here?
I'm so sorry.
Sit down, Cora.
Thank you.
You know, I've watched you this whole week that I've been here.
You work in a tavern, but you move like a lady.
Someone once told me to act like what you plan to be, so I try to be a little better than what I am.
And you are wrong pretty often.
This isn't how it's supposed to go, but I hoped to only ask this question once in my life, but I'm going to ask it twice...
But I will come back in two weeks and turn this ring into gold.
Well, I'll bring you a gold one.
And I'll whisk you away to the castle as Princess Cora.
Will you marry me?
Very early tomorrow, I'm afraid.
It left when the witch arrived.
I don't know how well that'll work with a boy.
It might not be a boy.
Zelena came by this morning.
While the dark one was stealing my heart, she was here gloating.
She said that my weakness was that I don't know enough about her past, so I've decided to summon someone who does.
We have to talk to my mother.
Yes, I know it looks battered, but that's the point.
This will do perfectly.
Oh, don't be jealous.
I've got Regina's heart, Charming's courage, and right in here, ready to be plucked, your lovely brains.
We've got everything we need.
It's a good time to celebrate, don't you think?
You don't have everything.
I'm not your doll.
A certain baby could be here at any minute, so I'm going to give you a choice on how you want to live out the rest of this time.
One choice is screaming agony, the other is much more pleasant.
It's a fairly simple ritual but not often performed.
If it's easy to talk to the dead, why not do it more?
Well, because to do it, you need the murder weapon and... the murderer.
What do we need to do?
Focus on Cora.
Welcoming thoughts?
Whatever you got.
Mother, can you hear us?
Cora, give us a sign.
Guess whatever secrets lie in her past, she wants to keep buried there.
You are a stubborn one, aren't you?
Well, I'm not Prince Jonathan.
Of course, there is no Prince Jonathan.
You lied to me.
You practically forced it into my hands when you thought that I was a prince.
A harlot is a harlot.
I'm with child.
I'm going to have a baby.
There may be no prince Jonathan, but there is a prince, and how will he feel when I tell him what you've done?
Give me enough to support this child.
Good luck finding me.
He got away.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
There's nothing you can do for me.
Allow me to try.
I'm Prince Leopold.
Thank you, your highness.
Make... sure you are.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not sure that's physically possible right now.
You can help with the tea cups.
There it was, my oldest night dress.
Did you ever get revenge for that?
That's a long-term plan.
You see, there aren't that many young people in my village, and, odds are, one of them will end up married to me.
That should do it.
You're wonderful.
And... cold.
It's a bit frosty, but I'm okay.
Uh, why, I'd build a fire for you, but I'm embarrassed to say I don't know how.
I do.
I'm going to be king.
I gather that happens when you're prince.
And I want to do right by that gift.
I keep telling myself I want to be a man of the people, and then I realize I can't even build a fire, a task any peasant can do.
Well, this peasant can fix that.
When the throne becomes mine, I'll need to provide an heir of my own.
You'll have to marry.
And start a family immediately.
That actually sounds nice.
Anyone in mind?
I'll let you know after I meet her.
That's tonight.
You don't sound very excited.
What's the use of having power if you can't choose whom to wed?
So do I.
So I'll admit that it's complicated.
Thank you.
I'm sure you had some things you wanted to say to her.
A sister.
Why would she give her up?
Why would she make us strangers to one another?
What was that?
I have no idea.
It's upstairs.
It's in there.
Okay, seriously, what is up with you?
I apologize for my rudeness.
We have to tell Regina and the others.
You should have a woman dress you more often.
Please, do have a seat.
I wonder how much civility I'll be asked to endure before this evening's true purpose is revealed.
Oh, how lucky for me.
Well, coercion takes many forms, my dear, but I can assure you, I'm not here for the boiled peas.
Why courage?
Why a brain?
Why this particular baby?
And more to the point, why is it of any interest to me?
Because my secret will reunite you with your long-lost son.
My son is not lost.
He's dead.
You watched him die.
This isn't idle cruelty.
I promise you, he's alive and waiting for you to find him.
It's against the fundamental laws of magic.
Magic doesn't fail.
People fail.
You've deciphered the laws of time travel.
To find my boy.
Perhaps never give him up.
This can't be.
The spell opened a limited portal for talking.
She sensed my presence and found a way to bleed through into our world.
But I can't hold her forever.
Well, low and behold, it turned into gold after all.
In two days, I will be a princess, and you will bow down and count yourself lucky to pull the weeds at my feet.
Been practicing in front of the mirror, eh?
You're as much of a fraud as I ever was.
My love for Prince Leopold is true, as is his for me.
But does he know how much of you there is to love?
Enough for me to live happily for the rest of my days, just like you wanted from me.
Bring it here tomorrow night and your secret shall remain just that.
Princess Eva, your carriage awaits.
I'm coming.
I don't know how much longer I can hold her off.
But if she wants to kill you, she's gonna have to go through me!
It's time for answers, mother.
My love, you frightened me.
What are you doing in the great hall at this hour?
Well, a wedding won't plan itself, and there's endless amounts of work to be done.
My love, I am so sorry for the terrible trouble that this lie has brought upon you.
Gossip means nothing to me.
There is no baby.
Only my love for you.
You only love yourself.
What is she doing here?
Princess Eva is here because she overheard your rendezvous in the garden yesterday.
And just as I said, the Miller's daughter is a worthless liar.
Whatever else Eva has told you is the invention of a jealous brat who would say anything to marry you.
Check her pockets.
Don't let me go!
Today your heart aches, your highness, but I promise a more worthy wife will give you the child that you deserve...
One that will be pure.
Pure as snow.
No one's ever been able to cast a spell to go back in time.
Well, clearly, she thinks she can succeed.
Why go back in time, I mean, we have no idea what she's trying to accomplish.
I do.
Life is too messy for it to ever be that simple.
All if it weren't for this Princess Eva?
You'll have never been born.
I'm guessing this is where your help ends.
And on this different path, Regina, you may not be, either.
It's a good thing no one has ever succeeded with this time-travel nonsense.
Somehow, some way, our baby is the key.
- What is she going to do to with...?
Just not very much of it.
Push!
As long as I have you, I can never be anything more than a Miller's daughter.
Thank you.
For what?
For showing me something I should have seen long ago.
Until then, a gentleman always makes amends for his failings.
Never on the first date, eh, dearie?
You just wanted the knife.
I hope you enjoyed the taste, because you just squandered your only chance to have your son!
My son gave his life so I could stop you, and I can see only one way to honor that sacrifice, and that's by killing you.
Celebration's over.
Need a hand?
You want to talk about it?
What's there to talk about?
You officially have a lessdamaging relationship with my mother than I do.
And you killed her.
I know how much you looked up to eva.
I'm sorry you had to learn she had such darkness in her past.
That wasn't the woman I knew.
It makes me wonder what happened that changed her.
If we had, I probably wouldn't have spent so much time trying to kill you.
Your mother's child.
I think we've wasted our last day being haunted by the past.
Now we can focus on being haunted by our impending lack of a future.
That could be another one of her tricks, too.
Sooner or later, your heart will find its way to happiness.
I know you, and you feel things deeply.
With or without it, you feel things with your whole soul.
Don't let anything hold you back.
My lady.
Look, there are its little fingers.
One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five.
I can't wait till you're born!
Hey, we might still be able to go to Senior Prom.
These two are gonna make great parents.
I've seen worse.
Actually, that's the umbilical cord.
We don't really need to know right now.
Okay, I'll see you again in ten days.
We've got a lot to do to get the house ready for our new guest.
Well, a girl can hope.
Thanks for helping out, Baxter.
Uno momento, por favor.
What's going on?
Your grandmother and I got you a crib.
Was I that grumpy when I was pregnant?
I do not want to see that.
I'd laugh if I didn't think it was a real possibility.
Uh, hey, Chef Rudy, you got a minute?
Wait, when did you start eating from the other side of the buffet?
But, um, how does a-- ah-- a shrimp platter, carpaccio, and, uh-- ah-- creme brulee sound?
I have to go ride a 300-pound Frenchman.
Wow, you scored.
Yeah, Rudy really came through.
Did you know that he swung both ways?
No, but when we slept together, he did ask me to do a few things that were a little suspect.
It does make me nervous, having to beg food for a baby shower.
Or maybe you could get a first one.
Oh, please, you've had two clients.
One paid you with used luggage and the other one stepped in front of a train.
That did teach me to get paid in advance.
You're not a lawyer!
Well, I wasn't a health inspector either, but restaurants paid me a lot of money to look the other way.
The computer program called Excel.
How about a 52-line PBX system with direct inward calling?
Oh, that doesn't sound very encouraging.
They sit in that box until I bring them home to Mother so she can do her sudoku on the back.
Well, maybe the problem is...
Wait, you live with your mother?
I have my own entrance.
Uh, let me ask you... this employment agency deal, this isn't what you really wanted to do with your life, is it?
God, no.
I wanted to write a Broadway musical.
Well, Mother tries, but ever since the stroke, she's got her own problems.
I can help.
You can?
I didn't want to say anything because it's intimidating to people, but I'm a certified life coach.
The Katzenjammer Life Coaching Institute in Geneva, Switzerland.
I don't want to give you false hope, but I've had a tremendous amount of success with composers.
Amazing.
So... so... so how do we do this?
Ooh, Wednesdays Mother and I watch Idol.
All you're doing is watching them.
Sometimes I vote.
I'll see you Wednesday.
Um... do I get some kind of discount if I pre-pay for a bunch of sessions?
And that's how it's done.
What you got going on there?
I'm making a little princess tiara for Violet to wear at her baby shower.
Aw, it's so precious when you overcompensate for being a drunken loser when she was a kid.
I just want to give my daughter the best day ever.
Well, how about I give my daughter the best day ever?
I just got a paying client.
I think his mother might actually be stuffed.
Honey, look, I'm making you a tiara.
What are you talking about?
I don't need it.
Sweetheart, I'm stealing food from the restaurant.
I decided to give the baby up for adoption.
I feel like someone just punched me in the heart.
Did not see that coming.
- Damn it, this is ridiculous!
That's my business.
No, it's not!
You're talking to your mother, right?
I'm talking to both of you.
You think I wasted my life?
Mom, you're a 35-year-old ex-alcoholic, you're all alone, and you're waiting tables.
Hey, first of all, I happen to like my life and I love my children and I love my job.
- What about me?
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
And I want this baby to have a chance at all of that, too.
I am doing the right thing.
I did not say a word.
Well, will you please talk to her?
Of course.
What does Luke say about this?
He doesn't know yet.
Really?
You have any advice?
Maybe I'm not a life coach.
I really want a drink right now.
"Violet, honey, please pass the peas to your sister-daughter."
You don't understand.
This was supposed to be our... do-over baby.
Do-over baby?
What about all the mistakes you made?
I made them because of you!
I was abandoned by my mother and thrown into the foster system.
Who do I get to blame?
Oh, get honest.
15, 20 years from now, how's it really gonna look?
Sorry.
Things did not go well in there.
Mom, let's go!
We're gonna be late for our AA meeting.
I don't want to go!
I want to get a quart of vodka, an eight ball, take out my teeth, and gum a couple of sailors.
Come on, angel, we're leaving!
You sure you didn't just wet yourself?
'Cause the Crypt-Keeper over here does it all the time.
All right, let's go to the hospital.
Is this one gonna be the do-over baby?
Come on!
Roscoe, we're leaving!
I got to go talk to my daughter.
I like where you're going.
And I was excited for the new baby, you know?
That is so messed up.
Violet, you're breaking the cycle.
You're gonna have a better life than me, and you're making sure that this baby has one, too.
I've been doing some research online, and there's a lot of great couples that really want to start a family but can't.
- You already found people?
Mike's a hedge fund trader and Andre's a choreographer.
Oh, my God, look at their house.
Think they'd adopt a 35-year-old waitress?
I love you, too.
Okay, we've made some real progress tonight.
Well, it's like you said, write what you know.
Next session, I expect to hear a verse and chorus for "Spooning Mama".
Without her, I wouldn't be a waitress.
Dumb-ass crackers!
Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt.
Sheldon didn't heckle him?
No, I don't feel so...
I'm leaving.
Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
What do you think I was gonna do at home?
Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?
Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.
Great, everyone's a Byomkesh Bakshi.
Now... here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer.
Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?
Thank you for my bobble head.
Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
Despite what her Bible says, recent archeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.
Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.
You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.
Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.
Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn't have any friends.
Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that... that I would play those games with them.
That is so sweet.
No, I was svelte as a gazelle.
A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.
Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?
I'm gonna need another clue.
Okay... give me the flowers and pie.
But if we show up and you're holding them, she'll think they're only from you.
They are only from me.
You said the gift of you was enough.
Yes... but now that I've seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there's no going back.
Boy, I can't wait to see the look on her face...
I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
You ready to talk about it?
I'm not nearly drunk enough.
Do you have any idea what it's like to see your mother ravaging someone?
Does a brisket count?
What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
I have to.
How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don't tell her how disappointed I am, and that I'll never forgive her?
Well, don't do it on the phone.
No, I'm just going to tell her I'm coming so she can give that Good Time Charlie the heave-ho.
Maybe this is none of your business.
I beg to differ.
I used to live in those genitals.
And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.
You're all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time.
And welcome to 20 years in the future.
Hey, can I go to the bathroom?
Fine, just try not to look too alive.
That's my jam.
So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?
But why?
Perhaps this will help.
Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
Not the worst idea.
Hey, I'm a famous actress living in London.
Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.
Of course not.
If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.
Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn't need the money.
Well, you don't go into science for the money.
Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.
He started it.
Okay, okay, guys-- new back stories.
Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York.
Uh, you're an actress, you're a professor and you have three beautiful kids.
Okay, let's do this.
While you confront your mother about her sex life?
I'd rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.
Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry.
Come in.
Can you recommend a surface you haven't had coitus on?
That's not funny.
Maybe we should sit at the table.
Well, I'm sure that, uh, you... have a lot of questions.
Who was he?
How long have you been involved with him?
A few months.
And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?
That is no way to speak to your mother.
Perhaps not.
But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas.
I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.
Or what?
Or I will send you to your room.
That's ridiculous.
Go to your room.
But I occupy the moral high ground.
Go to your room.
But I'm a professional scientist.
Go... to your room!
I'm a grown man.
Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world.
I'm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
In 20 years, who knows what'll happen with any of us?
I think you and Leonard will be together.
So, why do you think that?
Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better.
Hey, can I come in?
I thought you were waiting in the car.
I take it things didn't go smoothly with your mom.
Howard, we've all seen your mother naked.
That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.
I'm talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple years after my dad left.
I didn't know she did.
Well, let's just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El.
Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.
All I'm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom's happiness.
You may have a point.
And the healing begins.
I am.
Shelly, I'm sorry that you saw what you saw.
I know that this is hard for you.
I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy.
Doesn't this contradict all the religious rules you've been espousing your whole life?
You're right, it does, and it's something that I'm struggling with these days.
Then why are you doing it?
Because I'm not perfect, Shelly.
And that man's booty is.
Well, this is confusing for me.
But I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness.
That is very Christian of you.
Mother, if you're going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman.
You know, it's not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.
How old do you think I am?
My point is that you're going to need to be careful.
You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you're going to need a stronger friend named latex.
Are you having the sex talk with me?
Oh, come on, don't pout.
I'm sorry I ruined your game.
I'm not pouting, I'm brooding.
Which is how sexy men pout.
I liked the time travel element.
Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.
My phone doesn't have a calendar.
It's all right, I'll just write it on my hand.
And it's done.
Yup, we're all in.
All right, I'll see you guys in 20 years.
Tetanus shot?
Higher standards?
No, a condom.
I'm about to have sex, and I want it to feel bad.
Oh, here's one next to this movie ticket stub from Precious.
I wish I knew a guy with a condom.
A man, any man.
Max, I laid out the little cups, so all you have to do is fill them with cole slaw.
Said the girl who was on the Forbes "top ten to watch" list.
No!
Why would you spit in the face of God?
I got some cooling patches to soothe her muscles.
That is delicious.
Max, since you guys are getting serious, why not go on the pill, so every night you won't have to play "What can we turn into a condom?"
Great, now I'm a white trash mom.
Pretty much the filet mignon of corn chips.
Oh, no, I never wanted you to see me wearing this.
Yeah, so be a gentleman and take a step back, 'cause as bad as it looks, it smells worse.
I think you look beautiful.
Your wife looks beautiful.
That's because it's not beef, it's not made today, and it's not special.
Dinner at your home, just you and me?
How do you think your wife would feel about that?
We have an open relationship.
Did you think I'm the type of man who would have sex with another woman without asking my wife?
That is so American.
Yes, I thought you wouldn't believe me, so I set up a Skype call with her from France on Friday.
Hey, everybody.
Excuse me, beefcake has been on the menu since I started working here.
Oh, come on!
I'm sorry, I was in the middle of a conversation with Caroline.
I'm gonna give you two days' head start, and then he's mine!
Why do you care what his wife thinks about your hair?
You're not gonna be sleeping with her.
Although you'd be a lot more interesting if you did.
I'm not gonna be sleeping with him either.
You realize talking about math in a hair salon is my worst nightmare, right?
At least tell me they're gay.
Just have a seat over there.
So weird, 'cause I majored in head. [chuckles]
Dan.
Dan.
What makes you think he's straight?
Max, I need you to give me your gay.
Dan, Dan, Dan!
That's what I asked for!
Now my outside matches my inside, because I've always been an old drag queen trapped inside the body of a young black girl.
I even bought myself a flat French hat to make me more French.
Yeah, I got me the hat 'cause I didn't have time to grow out my pits.
Fine, but if I get too close to the bulb, my hair might blow up.
Okay, take a deep breath, and remember, this is ridiculous.
Bonjour, Caroline.
It is nice to meet you.
And you as well, Juliette.
I just want to set the record straight about Nicolas and I.
What more is there to say?
Thanks for coming.
I promise, just one drink at Nicolas's, and then we'll go to the movies.
And, Max, I can't believe you went out with that hair in public.
The only thing this hair and my mother have in common is they're both high.
Nicolas, I'm not staying.
I know you went to a lot of trouble with dinner, so I didn't want to be rude, but we can only stay for one drink.
Yeah, we should not stay more often.
I like your loft, man.
It's the perfect place to live if you like to commit really sexy crimes.
He's not married to his dessert, Max, and it's just one piece.
We're here, so he doesn't get a piece.
You got a pretty sweet setup for a married man who's single.
Creme caramel au coconut cake.
And then again that morning.
Is it your heart?
No, a pill-pill.
The pill-pill-pill?
Speaking of sluts...
Honestly, I prefer if you kill us.
Okay, well, we gotta go, Esther.
Oh, maybe you cannot dance, Caroline?
Can't dance?
One summer, I taught ballroom dance to homeless teens.
I promise.
Come in, come in, come in, come in, come in.
There is no coke.
No, I was just gonna talk to you.
Is that where he puts it in but doesn't move it around?
That's what I do when you're passed out.
That's what I do when you're passed out.
What is this, "previously on Caroline"?
Here are some blankets for you, Max and Deke.
You can take the couch.
I am so sorry about this.
Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs have sex with you.
Either that or I didn't take my pill.
Wow, Max, this is a big step that you may or may not have taken today.
You know if it's too much trouble, we don't have to go off condoms.
So you're the one guy in the world who wants to still wear a condom?
Do you have something?
Oh, so do you not want to take this step?
Hold that thought.
Uh, go fish, Max.
- Max, what are you doing?
[scoffs] I'm not getting in bed with you.
Max, get in the bed.
Uh, not anymore.
- Hey, Deke.
- Hey, Earl.
Best conversation I had today.
Max, last night I got the idea that maybe you thought that I didn't want to take our relationship to the next level.
What is this, "previously on Deke"?
Even though I thought I'd be the first one to get engaged.
I think we all thought that.
Deke, I don't know what you're gonna pull out of your pocket, but it better be a gun.
I can't wait to try it on.
Well, I am not throwing you a shower for that.
You're damn right I won't.
I'm dating this sweet, smart, smokin' hot guy who's just a train wreck.
Are sober people allowed to do coke?
You know how I told you people trust me with their money?
I embezzled from my clients.
So what happens next?
Maybe they'll send you to one of those swanky country club jails.
My lawyer said it might help if I had some character witnesses.
Well, it wouldn't be the first time I've lied under oath.
Thanks, but I was kind of hoping for someone a little less... sketchy.
What about you, Christy?
I'm not allowed to travel abroad.
It's not a competition, Mom.
Open your mouth a little, so you look like you're about to cry.
Tell me that doesn't look like house arrest to you.
Come on, I can do that.
Come on, we're gonna be late for the meeting.
Oh, actually, I can't make it.
Catch you later.
All I saw was the big eyes.
She's gonna be great on the stand.
You ready to go?
Let me just use the ladies' room.
If I tell you something, you promise you won't freak out?
Traditionally, this is where you say you're falling in love with me.
Oh, God.
But I have to go to work.
I-I think I got that thing that's going around.
All right, I'm all yours.
Hey, where you been?
What are you doing?
Frosting cupcakes.
What's the occasion?
It's You Signed Up to be Snack Mom and Forgot Day.
Nope, forgetful mothers do not get snacks.
You know... cupcakes aren't a very healthy choice.
Neither is criticizing me for doing your freakin' job.
I'm really thinking about going back to school.
I cannot wait tables my entire life.
You sure you don't mean on your back?
So what are you thinking about studying in school?
All right, fine.
I blew off work and spent the night with David.
Is that where you were when you missed your daughter's Lamaze class yesterday?
Oh, no, was that yesterday?
You are the best grandmother.
Yeah, only because you're the worst mother.
I thought you weren't gonna tell me how to live my life?
You're not the only liar in this room.
It just so happens that that guy told me he loves me tonight.
Oh, well, love.
That changes everything.
You deserve a cupcake.
Not bad.
Oh, I can't promise anything, but I'll try.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
Oh, hey, didn't see you there.
Cold people don't haggle.
So, would you like to hear the specials?
No, just the Kush.
No, just a couple of joints.
Look, paul handles the nickel-and-dime crap.
W-Wait, wait, uh, this stays just between you and me, right?
Oh, what are you looking at?
Yes, I'm banging the little blonde.
What the hell am I doing?
Oh, so you decided to give me a heart attack in the parking lot?
What's in it?
I don't think that concerns you.
Oh, my God, is this some of the money you stole?
How'd you earn it?
Selling Mary Kay cosmetics.
Just... tell the judge how I've turned my life around and that I'm a fine, upstanding citizen.
Got it.
If I had a real emergency, do you think I could... you know... dip into it?
Define "Real emergency."
I don't know, my kid needs an operation... 'cause his mom doesn't have... satellite TV.
Hello, Christy.
What are you doing here?
I'm concerned about you.
Apparently, Violet is going first.
I spent too many years making sure you ate, putting you to bed, and cleaning vomit off of you.
I am not going through it again.
You do realize you're having a baby, right?
Christy, you're lying about where you are, you're calling in sick to work, and now Gabriel says you're buying pot?
I saw you go in the walk-in with Rudy.
You ratted me out to my mother?
Okay, so it's eighth grade.
How long before you start buying them for yourself?
I know what I'm doing.
Christy... this David's just gonna drag you down with him.
I see what's going on here.
David and I are happy, and you guys can't handle it.
I'm happy... ish.
And I've had a few!
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
Maybe I should... go.
Yeah, maybe you should go.
Just waiting for the elevator.
Let's go inside.
You rat bastard!
And in my defense, I was very high.
Well, I was falling in love with you... and I was stone-cold sober.
That's so bad, it's almost good.
My feelings for you are so intense that it scares me.
Oh, for God's sakes, take the stairs.
I am going away for a long time.
Regina, I can't delay this anymore.
Now it's too late to run.
Sketchy... will you be my character witness?
I would be honored.
I got this.
I've bought drugs, sold drugs, a little gun smuggling, might have dabbled in some human trafficking.
But that doesn't mean I'm not a good person today.
Doesn't mean she's a good character witness, either.
I've sat where Regina Thompkins is sitting.
I know the regret she's feeling, the shame, because she hurt innocent people.
But what are we here for, Your Honor... punishment or redemption?
Which is why I recommend release with probation, so Regina can find honest employment and pay back the money she stole.
You do realize we're talking about $3 million.
Well, they may not get it tomorrow... but doesn't she deserve a chance?
I don't think so.
So you're just gonna be a douche about this.
I'm here, I'm here.
No, no, just state your name and tell us about the defendant.
I'm... here to speak on behalf of Regina Thompkins.
Sure, she's made some mistakes, but she's really turned her life around.
She's been sober for six months, and... let me tell you, that is not an easy thing to do.
Because... when you get sober, you... think the fun's over.
Unless you get lucky and meet a guy who actually makes you feel good, and then you think, "All right, I'm back!"
But you're not.
Because... you open your heart up... to this jerk... and he turns out to be a big, drunken, cheating idiot.
Yeah, the sex was great, Your Honor.
A leopard cannot change its spots.
Unless, of course, the leopard is Regina Thompkins.
Is it too late to give back some of that money?
Aw, with good behavior, you'll be out in two.
You could do two years standing on your head.
Or sitting on someone else's.
Here's what you do-- first day in there, you find the biggest badass in the yard, hit her with a sock full of nickels and show everybody there's a new queen bitch in town.
But doesn't that mean sooner or later someone's gonna whack the crap out of me?
Well, uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.
You need any help?
I got it.
I am done feeling bad about this.
I am!
Across the room?
Maybe it was ringing too much.
You're gonna need wire strippers.
Looks like it, don't it?
I'd better run out to my truck.
Use mine.
You know, phone company's always hiring.
Okay, so just leave them on the desk when you're done.
This computer y'all built, what's it say on the outside?
Cardiff Electric.
Whose name is that?
I closed ComputerLand at 100,000 units.
I'm 65 years old.
Why would I want $40 million when I can settle for five and just kick back, Jack?
My phone's been ringing, too, people wanting to buy this company outright.
They've been offering me a lot of change to close her down.
This office... what does it say outside?
The sign in the lobby, what does it say?
I heard he ran the factory floor himself.
You both run it.
As equals... because you are a rattlesnake, and you... you're a little bunny rabbit, but you're the brains behind this thing.
Eight percent of the company, fully diluted, four-year vesting, cliff at one year for each of us.
Good luck with that.
You gonna manufacture locally or in Taiwan to save some coin?
Japan has better output facilities, but the tariffs are tricky.
You might be able to do a deal with Intel in bulk if you know who to talk to, but it's the same guy who manages IBM's bulk deal, so it'll take some massaging.
Megahertz, minimum bucks.
All right, this is the first test shipment from the manufacturer.
We got 100 machines here, so I need all hands on deck QA-ing these boxes.
Hardware, software, failed pixels, I/O ports...
Check every millimeter of this machine.
Oh, Gordon, I don't know how to test a computer.
Oh, thank you.
Have you seen Joe?
I wondered how long it'd take till you took the corner office.
I just needed the TV.
Tell me that wasn't the best piece of marketing you've ever seen in this industry.
They're telling the world that they're going to topple IBM.
Okay, well, I also didn't see a computer anywhere in sight.
You want a computer, you buy one of ours.
People will buy the Giant, but will they remember it?
If we delay shipping just a few months...
- Don't you want it to be great?
- Joe, we keep futzing with this thing, it's gonna end up vaporware.
You need to sell your computer, okay?
She really did look like Cameron.
And again, this is strictly to get a sense of the department I'm inheriting.
How would you rate the quality of your work overall?
"Falling behind."
Care to clarify?
But then he left to start a company based on ideas he stole from my husband, so...
Because, honestly, I don't see one.
I suppose we could give you two weeks.
Actually, I would really prefer if today were my last day.
Can I take you to lunch, ma'am?
I financed it.
They were practically giving them away.
Graphics compression program is amazing.
So is phase modulation.
We're stable at 2400 baud.
How's my firmware holding up?
You know how many connections we can carry on the 3B5?
We can play "Zork" on this.
We can make our own "Zork," "Wizard, Warrior, Rogue."
God, everything is "Dungeons and Dragons" with you guys.
Well, then we don't get to be the phone company anymore.
It's causing the machine to turn off spontaneously.
Oh, will it delay shipment?
Well, we'll have to check every test unit.
Maybe this is an opportunity.
Maybe we delay a month or two to fix the bug and make some improvements.
This is bigger than plane fares and party costs.
We got software just sitting around while we figure out what's wrong.
Now that's something to celebrate.
Okay, listen up.
We've had a little hiccup with shipping, which means we've got some extra time, and because we're who we are, we're not gonna spend it playing "Pong" and twiddling our thumbs.
We're gonna capitalize.
I know you've been chomping at the bit to write something that's not a peripheral driver.
Good, because today, Cardiff Electric has entered the software application business, and in 60 days, I want a killer app ready to ship with the Giant.
And then I want us to make them.
You guys up for a challenge like that?
You bet.
Good, good, good.
Do you wanna have one of our own?
It's definitely gonna delay shipping.
I think Joe did it on purpose.
I-I don't understand the benefit.
He can't live in reality.
He's always chasing some fantasy, you know?
It doesn't matter.
The truth is that I can't trust him.
What are you saying?
I think you know what I'm saying.
I've got three teams running diagnostics on the 3B5, checking to see if you've corrupted it in any way.
You know the network can transmit way faster than we're letting it.
We can phase shift, modulate amplitude, insert error correction... basically whatever we want.
Who do you really work for?
All right, what do we got?
You, let's hear it.
Um, um, it's a moon phase calendar.
So you type in the date and it gives you the upcoming phases of the moon for the next 25 years.
So, like, on my birthday in 1997, it's going to be a waxing gibbous.
You.
Careful, you're gonna love this.
A simulator... beekeeping.
Full-on "zimulation." Hardcore.
Think bigger.
What, so Cameron was the only one of you that had any real ideas?
Well, what are your ideas, man?
Lay it on me.
What is Joe's Achilles' heel?
He's in love with her, you know?
I'm just gonna threaten to.
Donna, this is a print driver.
Joe doesn't know that.
I can't do this without you.
Do what, Joe?
Cameron... come back to Cardiff.
Oh, God, you're pathetic.
We can start from scratch.
That sounds nice.
We could build something together, a partnership.
Make our own future.
You're a footnote.
You want to know the truth?
Just a sad little boy... with a lot of wasted potential.
Come here, you're gonna want to see this.
They all went to work for Mutiny.
Well, that's the best part.
Okay, I need you guys to buy as many XTs for the shelves as you can until these max out.
So, I can't pay you, but I can offer you a percentage of the company.
Why me?
- Well, what's the idea?
- Connecting people.
I've got a phase-shifting and amplitude modulation protocol that breaks 9600 baud.
Wait, what is this really?
Is this some sort of revenge hire?
You got me.
A thousand machines out of a hundred thousand, one percent?
Return rate will be less.
We won't even feel it in the profit margin.
Ah, I don't know.
Can you guys excuse me for just one moment?
Busy bee.
So, what do you do?
Oh, I... uh, I'm not working presently.
Well, you sold your first computer.
Mm-hmm... mm, which reminds me.
Gordon?
Give me your hand.
It's just like the original one with the same polyalphabetic cipher.
I "darf" you very "gerp."
I'll "darf" you to the day I "zof."
Gordon, they're asking for you.
All right, everyone, listen up.
I'd like to invite you all out to the parking lot where the first shipment of Cardiff Giants is waiting to be christened for its maiden voyage.
All right, first off, I'd like to start by saying that I wouldn't be standing here tonight in front of all of you if it weren't for Joe MacMillan.
None of us would be.
Sometimes you had to drag us forward kicking and screaming, but in the end, you were right.
And to my wife... where's Donna?
To my other partner, without whom I'd be completely lost.
I love you, honey.
Watch your head.
Hey, just give me a minute.
I can't believe it.
Thanks.
For everything.
Remember when Joe followed us to "Return of the Jedi"?
Do you think he even watched the movie?
I know he didn't.
Then why did he have popcorn?
I think he just wanted to look more normal.
You just hit a Porsche, buddy.
Hope you got great insurance.
My wife!
Oh, shit.
I really hate creamy.
Hey, girls, why don't you go out to the van?
All right, I'll be home by 5:00 as usual and Rose will pick up the kids.
I can't lose you, but more than that, you can't just sit here and stew.
You should do whatever it is that you want to do.
Come work at Cardiff.
Donna, it... it needs you.
Thank you.
But I don't think that Cardiff is the best place for me right now.
Okay, well, you know, you should work wherever it is that you want to work, okay?
Uh, I just want you guys to keep a few things in mind.
For me, it's everything.
Uh, and just one last thing.
Hello, welcome to Mutiny.
Bullshit.
What did he do, take it to the beach?
That's good, right?
If Joe MacMillan were here, he'd have us building a damn spaceship.
Uh, no, thanks.
That's 'cause they just built it two years ago.
It's that way, though, right?
Sure, a couple dozen miles.
You know there's an access road about an hour away coming in from the south.
Thought I'd take the scenic route.
Is it all right if I leave my truck here?
Hmm, some kind of stargazer, huh?
I'll watch your truck for you.
Thanks.
You know there ain't nobody up at Fiske, save the one.
Don't get yourself shot.
I'll be careful.
What do you want to see up there?
Uh, Richard, happy birthday.
Now, you're only saying that because you heard her say that.
Uh... guilty.
Owen, you shouldn't have.
Sorry, I'm just, uh, extremely excited.
Well, you're not gonna be printing anything just yet.
Until you've read every scrap of data on every test we've run, you touch nothing.
There are the research binders, so you should probably just go ahead and dig in.
If you're chosen for the study.
I'm only looking at the hearts... trying to keep my judgment unsullied.
Doesn't really make for regular coverage.
Oh, there's definitely a mass here.
What happened to my surgery?
Is it?
- Page Dr. Webber.
Yes, and you are...
That stupid nurse of whatever she was said I didn't qualify.
No more talk about my birthday.
I mean, there are fine surgeons working well into their 70s, and I am nowhere near 70.
He did.
Happy birthday.
Like we have to vow to the hospital gods?
Or rather enveloped it.
I just found out I have a brother.
You don't have a case.
Listen, before anyone resorts to litigation, let me just take this before the other board members.
But I know why you're here, mom, and I could have saved you a trip.
I already called Mike Farris.
Um, are you suggesting that I'm after your money?
I have no idea what you're after, dear.
All right, that's enough.
You're not gonna march in here and start questioning my wife's character.
You want to talk about her character?
She left a man at the altar.
Wonderful.
What's inappropriate is the engagement was 15 minutes at a rest stop on the turnpike.
I'll sign the stupid paper.
But it will calm her down.
I'm part of her family now.
I don't think an olive branch is the worst thing in the world to offer.
Yeah, well, you're a better person than I am.
Oh, come on!
That... how would it work?
I'm deadly serious.
These kids want to learn.
I mean, please, tell me this is pressing...
There is this internet-dating site.
Just tell her it's just a stupid piece of paper.
Yeah, if she runs, I'm blaming you.
Owen said not to talk about it.
- I don't know!
I'm coming with you.
Now that it's coming, I really want to live.
I want the chance to be her mom.
So, can you please bring Dr. Yang in here so I can talk to her, please?
Well, I'm heading into the fundoplication, and you'd be there, too, if you were in peds.
Okay, look, I thought it was nuts when Mer gave it to me, and I knew you'd hate it, too.
What is your problem?
In my experience, you sign papers, and it's a kiss of death.
Okay, then just listen.
We want to understand how all those neurons interact, so we're gonna start with a smaller group like everybody here in the hospital.
You're just saying that your thing is more important than mine.
I'm saying my thing feeds your thing.
This is you.
Also, it looks like a butthole.
Either way, it works.
You have a slight murmur, but, besides that, you are well.
Your O.B. will monitor your cardiac function, and page me if there are any complications.
And they've got their stories and lives and family...
It was inside of me all along.
We've talked about this.
Actually, I'm on Greg's side here.
They throw out people just like that.
They're done with you, and then they throw you out with the trash.
I'll throw it in a jar, and you can take it home.
The sensors were an answer to a question that I asked you.
Oh, why, 'cause you have government lawyers now?
I'm sorry.
I feel terrible.
Down to seven... that's fast.
I know what I want.
"A busy professional seeks"... what?
Um... someone who doesn't care to cook or get out of bed when it's not a work day.
Good.
Now, let's talk about the children.
Will you have children?
In what religious tradition will they be raised?
We don't know.
We haven't talked about what religious tradition we will or won't raise our theoretical children in yet.
That's a conversation you might want to have.
Avery children become Avery foundation board members.
The foundation controls $480 million in charitable funds for the advancement of medicine.
Will your children be taught that people who are pro-choice go to hell or their pro-choice father is going to hell or their grandmother?
Will they stop supporting medical institutions that perform abortions or provide information about abortions like, for example, this hospital?
Will they vote to stop supporting stem-cell research?
And I don't get the impression that either of you has given a moment's thought to what that means!
Hello, little brother.
I see a finger.
No, two... three fingers.
I still want to know what you said to get him to consent.
He promised him a doggy bag.
- No, you don't have to apologize to her.
And I am so sorry.
Apologize to your mom.
She's the one.
Yeah, we're working on that.
Lloyd, our work to map the brain is like the brain itself.
It's dependent upon connections, our innovation and inspiration of scientists like Dr. Torres and millions of others.
If we have a policy that thwarts innovation, then we're stopping before we even start.
The president himself...
You can tell that to the president.
We will... have to... figure out... a... way to share.
In the meantime, you can send us the plans for your sensors, and, uh, Dr. Torres, of course, uh, should continue her work.
And mine is sitting in a basement, and we need to change that.
You're telling me she's gonna have to grow up without a mother?
There are other options.
I... that's scary.
And you told him where to stick it, right?
Happy birthday, sir.
You've had over 20 responses.
Transition is movement from one part of a life to a whole new one.
A-a-and board meetings at 15?
Or cows.
You.
Because what's been waiting there...
Might be glorious.
Who or what did you do to get this $20 tip?
Because I wheeled a customer home the other night, and all I got was a 5.
And that was after we made out and I gave him a bath.
I pull that out whenever I need a manicure.
Well, it's that time of year again.
He also complimented these moccasins, which are also controversial around here.
Well, they do have the word "mock", "ass" and "sin."
This is why I never wear overalls, 'cause you two would be...
Precisely.
Okay, well, we have to talk about our taxes, and what we're gonna claim, and, no, you cannot claim I'm ruining your life.
I did that last year and got $10 back.
It's only 12:30.
Whoa, good, you're still open.
My fiancee wants a cupcake, and she always gets what she wants.
I'm nothing like that sounded.
He hates this neighborhood.
Tim put my ring in one when he proposed.
I gave him a 20 to move to that Mini Cooper instead of our car.
Remind me to start calling Han "Mini Cooper."
- Yes.
I told you I didn't want any more white girls in the shop.
And since when do we do wedding cakes?
I also went to high school, but I can't tell you which president Rock Hudson was.
Oh, it's not about Deke.
If you remember, I'm the one who sent his 'fro out the door.
Weddings are just stupid.
This whole idea of celebrating love?
I mean, love works out less than Chris Christie.
I'll take whatever I can get.
Okay, we're done.
I love their menorah-nge juice.
Yeah, you know, it was always my dream to have a dress shop.
Yeah, good thing you downloaded the "Find Your Drunk Roommate" app.
Don't you have boyfriends?
You're so calm.
Yeah, well, I was in the plane that crashed in the Hudson, so after that everything's just kind of been "meh."
So you want an obnoxious cake on a trust fund wearing an ironic t-shirt with HPV?
Wow, she changes her mind more than I change my underwear.
So twice?
Sophie, on your tax form here, you listed your occupation as "Sophie."
Do you have any legitimate anything that we can use for anything?
You can't write off liquor.
No, Irina Stolichnaya.
Yeah, well, I do work out of it.
Not the good stuff on the top shelf!
I'm on the phone with Claire.
You mean un-Claire?
She wants to make a couple changes.
Max, I beg you. $1,300.
(Claire) Max, I've been thinking, and I know I said I didn't want the fondant frosting, but now I just saw a photo of another wedding cake that was so gorge.
Yes, definitely fondant.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility that has nothing to do with that couple and may be more about you and a certain groom that didn't happen.
What, you can't light a couple's head on fire without it being about your ex-boyfriend?
Well, someone was crying.
Max, I need a break.
To the left, sir.
[both screaming] Other left!
Oh, what, is everybody blind now?
[hip-hop music] Who are you even dancing for?
Everyone's blind.
Don't got it.
You think 'cause I'm fake smiling I won't throw you down a flight of stairs?
You do that?
I spent the whole morning making 17 turkeys look like 17 hams for that crazy bitch.
The bride has cold feet.
That crazy bitch.
There's gonna be popsicles?
She's not that crazy.
We also really need a toilet that flushes everything the first time.
Man, why does every uncle I know try to screw me?
So what are we gonna do?
Okay, I feel like you guys are forcing me into this dress.
Listen, I'm thinking that maybe I bailed out of my shop too soon.
I mean, I left after only a year.
Well, everybody's afraid of failure.
No, not failure.
Well, I mean, it wasn't easy for you guys, right?
I mean, none of us do.
Not even Han?
Claire, who knows you better than us?
You know what she's not?
Now, remember, don't lift this veil until the party planner hands me that check.
Why don't you have to wear the dress?
You're practically a virgin.
Max, somebody has to walk down the aisle, and I can't do it.
Marriage means something to me, and I only plan to walk down that aisle once.
You also said that about the yeast infection aisle at CVS, but there you were last Saturday pretending to buy children's cough syrup.
Let's go.
People are like, "Who's that?"
If you think they're like, "Who's that?" now, wait a few minutes till that veil gets lifted.
You look stunning, babe.
Babe, if you're there, who is...
'Sup?
Babe, you should have said that before the vasectomy.
You can always reverse it.
Again.
So you're the father, huh?
And you stuck around.
That's an interesting way to play it.
May I cut in?
Oh, no, with her.
Oh, I thought you were just happy to see me.
I did, which is the worst, because it made me feel almost like a person.
And I was watching you guys dance together, and now I'm thinking I might be into girls.
That's our cue.
It's gluten-free.
Here's a churro.
So, you find anyone else you like?
Wow, all these people trying so hard to have a kid and they can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm just hoping once I find the perfect couple, he'll realize that this is for the best.
- Passeroo.
"We may be barren, but we're really caring'."
- No, thank you.
- I'm kind of liking these people.
I had to go through the whole thing with her.
You know, a little picture of a baby with a line through it.
Anyway, my daughter's being strong, and I'm trying to be strong for her.
And my Mom's around.
Thank you.
We'll take a ten-minute break.
Help yourself to coffee and cookies.
Uh, hey... actually, just coffee.
Ooh, I know that you're two weeks sober and were touched inappropriately by your babysitter, but I don't remember your name.
Ooh, you don't want to do that.
- What do you care about?
- How much do you charge?
- Welcome to the team.
We, um recently heard him speak at a social event.
Oh, God, he's a drunk?
- He's not a drunk.
- And he's free.
- Anyway, he says that you have to get Luke to sign his rights away before the adoption can go forward.
- Hey, Luke.
Okay, I'll order something.
How's the fried fish sandwich?
It's a lightly-breaded seafood treat.
- Okay, then, I'll take a cheeseburger.
Yeah, I don't want to talk about that.
- Would you like fries and a drink?
I struggled to make ends meet, and I'm still struggling.
Anyway, Violet found this wonderful couple who really want to adopt a baby, and they're coming by the house tomorrow.
That's $4.28.
Why don't you just drop by and meet them and see what you think?
- I already know what I think.
- What's going on, Counselor?
- No, I can't do it.
- We good here?
You seemed fine at the meeting.
I was high as a kite at the meeting!
- Luke.
How'd you even know?
Your mother showed up at my job and told me.
I was in the mood for a Happy Slappy Meal.
Thanks.
So you're okay with all this?
- I'm Jeff.
Me, too.
And, uh, this is our attorney, Steve Curtis.
We can discuss my fee later.
Please, come, sit down.
- You have a lovely home.
- Not really, but thank you.
Yes, we do.
Quiet time.
I read a lot of profiles, and yours really stuck out.
She wanted to go with the Helvetica font, uh, but I insisted on Courier to make it easier to read.
We compromised with Times New Roman.
I like fonts.
Wingdings are my favorite.
Do you have any questions you would like to ask us?
Please go back to fonts.
Yes, I design video games.
- Is that still too much?
You have to get the monkey through the China shop without breaking anything.
But he's so clumsy.
- Try swinging from the chandelier.
Anyway, we just want you to know that if you do choose us, we will do everything we can to give your baby a great life and love him or her with all of our hearts.
Hey, you're making the rest of us look pretty bad here, sister.
- What do you think?
- I think you're really nice people, and I hope you have your baby someday, but not this one.
HowamIdoing?
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.
We've been through this before.
We had an adoption fall through last year.
We walked the birth mother through the whole pregnancy, decorated a nursery, were at the hospital for the birth, and then the mother changed her mind.
I actually tried using alcohol to numb my pain.
Well, we certainly understand that.
- I just did not like how it made me feel.
I think that if you give Luke a little more time, he'll come around.
I'm sorry, but we already drove home once with an empty baby seat in the back of the car.
- It was really nice to meet you.
I better go check on Violet.
Why don't you get rid of him.
- What you doing?
I'll keep the baby, and maybe when it's 16, 17 years old and hates my guts, then I'll look at college.
Oh, they hate you sooner than that.
And just because we lost the Taylors doesn't mean there's not another great couple out there.
I wanted them.
Yeah, but he's cool weird.
And she's, like, the best mom you could ever ask for.
Okay, I'm just gonna let that go.
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's better this way.
Sorry to break this up, but we've got a lawyer on the roof.
He's my daughter's boyfriend.
- Now you know how it feels.
Okay, what do you want?
I need some advice, and you're the smartest person I know.
Oh, well, thanks, and I'm sorry you don't know more people.
The reason I don't want to give the baby up is 'cause I don't want to lose Violet.
And I'm probably gonna be flipping burgers for the rest of my life.
Oh, sweetie, that's the wrong reason to keep the baby.
- What's the right reason?
- 'Cause you "want" a baby?
All I really want is Violet.
Make something of yourself.
I only believe in God when I'm high.
All right, let's put a pin in that and keep thinking.
- You're sure you're okay with all this?
- Thanks.
We're doing the right thing, Luke.
- So what now?
- I have to file this at court.
- Do you still love me?
- I never stopped loving you.
Smartest person I know.
Can I say something horrible?
Since when do you ask?
Yeah, this is the hardest thing I've ever gone through.
- It wasn't a joke.
I just keep telling myself that my daughter's gonna have a better life because of this decision.
So what I'm hearing is I inspired you.
I am so proud of you.
- Thanks, Mom.
I would like that very much.
Hey, so what are your plans after high school?
How'd you like to come and work for me, learn how to design video games?
_
He thought I was just a girl.
I wish I could have seen his face before you cut it off.
Did the Captain say what was in the bottle that he wanted me to take?
No, he just said you had to drink it or something really bad would happen.
And Adalind did it.
- Oh, yeah, I read about them.
- So Nick would sleep with her.
I swear to God, I'm gonna find her, and I'm gonna...
All right, look, we better figure this out pretty quick.
And if we have to lie, we better all be telling the same one.
I'm a friend of Danny Rivera's, Lawrence Anderson.
I didn't want to do this over the phone.
I don't have all the details... some sort of severe head injury.
The bullet fragment hit the pericardial sac.
That's one.
Just tell them it was mine, and I keep it in that room.
Hey, Burkhardt and Griffin just got here.
Had our phones turned off.
Good thing you weren't here.
He tried to kill her after he shot the Captain.
The rest of him's upstairs.
He was carrying a Canadian passport with his picture and the name Walter Rathenau, along with a lot of euros.
He probably wasn't planning on sticking around.
So Theresa was staying in the guest room?
It's like a diary, really old, talk about cutting off people's heads.
It's been handed down in my family for a long time.
What kind of book is it?
Just a bunch of stories.
Last place we expected to get a case like this.
Since about 3:00.
You know why Captain Renard was here?
Could have been a case we were working on.
Just remember what Nick told you.
We got company.
You cannot run.
You're supposed to be in Paris.
Who are you?
The detectives have filled us in on some of what happened.
But Miss Rubel was staying here?
In our upstairs guest room.
Walk us through what happened.
I should come along with you.
That won't be necessary.
They're gonna want formal statements.
Then you're gonna have to go into the precinct.
Okay, he... he opened the door and was leaving, and then... and then I heard these sounds, and... and I didn't know what they were until he fell back into the room on the floor.
And he saw me, so I ran, and he shot.
That's the bullet hole.
What happened next?
Well, I ran up the stairs, and he came after me.
Where'd you get the machete?
It was on the chair.
You always keep a machete in your room?
How long have you been staying here?
A few weeks.
Make something up if you have to, but bring her down.
Is this important?
So Sean Renard is dead.
Should he lose a second son, there will be hell to pay.
What happens if the King finds out Weston Steward was one of ours?
That would be unfortunate.
It is imperative that you tie Mr. Steward to Mr. Burkhardt instead of us.
She sees a police captain get shot, killer tries to shoot her, and she chops his head off?
If it was my daughter, she'd be a basket case.
If she was, she'd be dead.
What's that?
Nothing.
We're done.
Please, you guys, don't let us drag you into this more than you've already been dragged into it.
Where's Nick?
He had to take Trubel to the precinct.
I'm just really sorry that all this stuff happened on your wedding day.
Did Captain Renard tell you why he came to see Detective Burkhardt?
I said Nick was at the wedding and told him where it was, and that's when he walked out the door and got shot.
And you said you didn't know the identity of the man who shot Captain Renard?
I think he was gonna shoot the Captain again.
Then he saw me and decided to shoot me instead, so...
Her story's consistent.
Everything she says matches the crime scene.
There's no link between her and Steward, no motive other than self-defense.
I think she's telling the truth.
Flight number and arrival time?
They must have made some kind of deal.
She's handling it pretty well for someone who just cut off a guy's head.
As long as you're here, you have any idea why your agent would want to shoot our Captain?
We don't know who he's working with or why.
So, if you guys have any ideas... we're open.
We'll be talking.
Kent, I think you better come down here.
What's the problem?
Please leave me a message.
He's not answering.
Well, he just logged out.
Well, he's been in surgery over three hours.
There were pictures in it, and the drawings looked a little like what I thought I saw that time.
Am I making any sense at all?
Hey... monsters do live inside people.
When you told me that you'd seen things, what'd you mean?
I wish I had better news.
It's appropriate that you contact his next of kin and have them get here as soon as possible.
I bet the Captain knows, not that he's in any position to tell us.
Well, I sure would like to ask her and not politely.
How did it go?
Trubel, you did what you had to do for Nick.
And what we got to do right now is find Adalind.
Well, that's not gonna happen 'cause she's on a flight to Vienna.
Adalind did this, not you.
We just have to find out how.
She slept with Nick.
Well, that's good to hear, because what I'm thinking is pretty damn awful.
She somehow made herself look just like Juliette.
Oh, I'm just hoping this isn't some sort of Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester.
They make a mess of things.
All right, well, best place to start cleaning up a mess is the spice shop.
Nick, we won't let Adalind do this to you, okay?
Dude, I wouldn't even have a life to screw up if it wasn't for you, okay?
So quit complaining.
Hey, maybe we should be going to the trailer.
I guess I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Do you feel any different?
And you know I would never have done that...
I guess she wasn't interested in talking.
Let's have a look.
I support that.
You do, do you?
I wish our friends were getting married more often.
I was wondering where you were.
What do you mean?
Looks like Mr. Steward was working for someone other than the FBI.
We need to check bank accounts, phone records, run this guy down.
You get any more sleep last night?
Not much.
- You gonna be okay?
- I don't know.
It's weird, you know, not being weird anymore, just being a regular cop.
You were really good at it before.
Housekeeper let herself in about 8:30 this morning.
House belongs to Dr. Henry Slocombe, works at Sitre Corporation here in Portland.
We checked the premises, no signs of any break-in.
Where's Slocombe?
She said she heard a scream, saw Dr. Slocombe drive off pretty fast in his Porsche.
She assumed it was an argument until she saw us.
His car's not here, and it's not in the street.
Once Slocombe drove off, how'd he get back?
I've never seen anything like it.
How'd you find this place?
It has no address, and it's not in my name.
What are you doing?
I figure I'd better learn as much as I can, now that, you know, everything's changed.
All right, what are we looking for?
Some Wesen that probes the back of your head and you can't remember anything.
We have to prove to our client that what you're stealing is worth the fee we're asking.
Give them this.
This is a key piece to the CVA project, compliments of Henry Slocombe.
Tell me about the collateral.
And get rid of that car.
Sir, stop where you are.
Keep your hands where we can see them.
Looks like some kind of memory eater.
That would explain the condition of our victim.
It's got to be the Gedachtnis Wesen, right?
All right, we're gonna need you to come with us.
I met Henry Slocombe through a mutual friend, Danny Rivera.
Last night.
His girlfriend, Alexandra, had just returned early from a trip.
They got into a bit of a fight, and I began to feel like a third wheel, so I left.
I checked out this morning and was in the process of returning his Porsche when I got pulled in here.
We were hoping you might.
Now I understand why I'm here.
Am I under arrest?
Well, even if he's lying, it's gonna be hard to tie him to the crime without any fingerprints or any witnesses that remember him.
We don't even have a motive.
Look, there's only one kind of Wesen that can make those kind of marks, and if that's not him, we are wasting our time.
This is everything that I can remember.
You're free to go.
Sir, if you'll follow me...
What the hell are you doing?
All right, you better stay with him.
You okay?
We're supposed to be taking you to get your driver's license test this weekend.
How am I supposed to feel okay about letting you have that, when you're doing stuff like this?
Mom, I need to be able to drive.
Please, I'm a grown man.
I know it means a lot to you.
I'm sorry about the beer.
Someone's supposed to be picking me up from work.
Why was I in a hospital two towns over?
It's a better hospital also.
So I wanted to make sure you had the best, given you jumped in front of a car to save my dumb-ass brother.
Come on, I'll show you inside.
So, uh, your room's upstairs.
You'll be safe here until this all blows over.
I'm very interested in keeping you alive.
Do you have family?
Anyone I need to call, so they're not worried about you?
No, they don't care about me.
Here you go.
Well, he doesn't.
Well, okay, I'll just drive home, call him, and then come back.
I guess you heard the news.
Well, I would never say someone dying is convenient.
Well, then you'd be lying or ignorant.
There are many times, Norma, when death is convenient.
I don't want to do this anymore.
You don't want to do what?
It's nothing personal.
I just... this is very important to me, and we barely know each other.
That didn't seem to bother you the other day.
Before you had the environmental impact report.
Before Lee Berman drove off a cliff.
No, I'm not saying that at all.
That would be crazy, right?
I just feel that I can take it from here.
Well, it's... it's been great getting to meet you, and I wish you all the best.
Does that seem right?
But a lot of the people around here in this town are yokels.
And I know Rob is trying to get a council together that's a little bit more sophisticated and educated.
Not... not to sound like a snob.
And I'm gonna have George call you to help prep you for the meeting.
No, I'm not trying to set you up again.
He helped three senators get elected, and I really think he could help get this seat.
Really?
That's good.
What's this?
It's a little elixir I made for you from some herbs in my garden.
Lavender is the main component.
It has anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.
But that's not our problem.
Maybe I need more towels.
- I'll bring some later.
I'll see what I can do.
What are you doing?
Thank you.
Norman, give me a moment with Cody, please.
I don't want my son drinking with you.
Who said we were drinking?
So don't encourage him to do it, do you understand me?
That's the last time you go with her.
I'm not gonna make a scene today, but I'll drive you from now on.
Mom, you won't have to, okay?
Just promise me you'll use your head, and you're not gonna let that girl make you do anything stupid.
I'm gonna swing by my place and steal some liquor before we head out.
I guess more lately.
I don't know why.
It's kind of cool to be outside in the rain.
It's a little cold.
That's what liquor is for.
I'm sorry about your dad.
What do you mean?
He's not always like that.
I just wish he could be happy.
Oh, I just take it out.
I mean, I can't do anything uber-athletic, but it's workable.
Well, it is a pretty rad spot.
Hey, Emma.
We can all hang out here.
Want to find out?
I was wondering if you had some tips on issues to cover.
You're not gonna get that seat.
What is it with you about me...
Well, my friend Christine Heldens got me a meeting.
I don't think that could've happened if there was no chance.
You can?
That's 'cause it's cold.
That's not a reason to not go and do it.
Yeah, and don't forget to let go.
It's not brain surgery.
Ah, I wish I could do it.
Can't you just take that stuff out for a second?
Yeah, well, I do sometimes.
I want to try.
Guys, stop treating her like she's made of glass.
Everyone isn't just some toy for you to play with!
Listen, man, she didn't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Christine said that you used to be a lawyer?
So do I.
Anyway, I always identified with that guy for some reason, the lawyer.
He was brave, and he cared about people and justice, so I went to law school.
And then?
And then my ex-wife found out how much public defenders make a year, and suddenly, I was at a white-shoe firm doing mergers and acquisitions.
Trust me, you can only do that for so long before you start sounding like Scrooge Mcduck.
My parents look like they should be on the cover of an album from the late '60s.
My dad started growing weed for him and some of his buddies, and turns out he kind of had a knack for it.
It was awesome weed, and everybody wanted it.
He was kind of a botanical artist.
And pretty soon, he had this big business going.
Then, my parents both died and left me the business, whether I wanted it or not.
This is incredible.
It's the part I love.
Yeah, I can tell.
That's good to know.
It's not gonna be hard.
Speaking of running things, if you're in charge, how come I never see you?
I don't like getting my hands dirty.
That's kind of funny.
I mean, you really seem to like dirt.
I do like dirt.
Well, so what is?
Don't... don't be so worried about bringing all this information to the meeting, that you leave yourself at home, 'cause you're the best part.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Are you awake?
I am now.
Don't take this personally.
I won't.
I don't know what I was trying to prove.
Oh, yeah, I don't know what any of us were trying to prove.
Oh, no, I don't think I did.
You know, like, the world's coming to an end.
You're just sensitive, and to be honest, it was nice to have someone be that upset on my behalf.
Yeah, so it all just seemed normal.
But I don't want you to worry about it, please.
I am gonna get working on my crow.
We'd like to preserve the integrity of... wow.
We'd like to preserve the coastal integrity of White Pine Bay.
What exactly did he tell you to focus on?
He told me that I shouldn't be so focused on reciting facts that I forget to bring myself, that I'm the best part.
I got to go to the hardware store and get glue for the glue gun.
Good luck, mother.
They'd be lucky to get you on their stupid council.
The mayor is ready for you, Mrs. Bates.
So how do you know the Heldens?
And you also know Nick Ford.
Yes, I do.
He also has really great things to say about you, and he really wants you to have this seat.
I appreciate his support.
Oh, you don't want me to talk about my positions on...
So it was nice to meet you, Norma.
You've made a really big impression around here in a short time.
Sorry about the other day.
Just got out of control.
Oh, Norman's not here right now.
Is he all right?
Well, he's sensitive and emotional.
Please, tell me.
- No, he, like, leaves his body.
He can physically move and even talk a little, but he's not in there.
And then he wakes up later.
It's like he's sleepwalking.
Well, he told me not to tell his mom, but now I'm worried I should be telling someone, 'cause maybe there's something really wrong with him and he needs help.
So this is me, just kind of giving you this information, so you can do what you think is right.
There, I'm done.
Why didn't he want you to tell Norma?
He just said, "she'll get upset."
What's wrong?
I'd rather tell you in person.
Emma, what's wrong?
Did you know Norman is having blackouts?
I'm sorry.
Can someone get their license if they've been experiencing blackouts?
Well, I want to know how you know, because I don't believe you know.
I just think you're think you're making all this up because you don't want me to drive.
Go home, mother.
I'm sorry, Norman, it seemed like the right thing to do.
I got to go work all night.
What the hell's going on out here, hmm?
Nothing, dad.
What's this guy doing here?
Maybe things will go right this time.
That's what I like about you.
Bright-sider.
"Almost" and "done," not the same thing.
Yeah, but when we are done... then no more work for the city's slimiest crime boss, right?
We're not out of here yet.
I'll take a look around.
What is it?
Nothing.
It must be nothing.
- And the vaccine?
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed girl, would you?
Amateur.
But you know who didn't use any?
- Them.
- Let's get this train moving again.
- What the hell happened to our driver?
- He's not our driver, it was a setup.
- Ambush.
- You think?
- What did you mean by "setup"?
- Only one person knew why we were here.
How is it?
NO good?
No.
Looks like this is our stop.
Thanks.
You may be a damn good cyborg... but you're not a robot.
What idiot is still airing these commercials?
The same idiot who provides the electricity to run this city.
Well, maybe "run" is a little generous.
But what we have is better than nothing.
That's debatable.
Time to see Two Horns.
If we don't go see him, he'll think we took off with the damn vaccine.
Maybe we forget what we owe Two Horns.
I don't know.
Olympus?
Everything here just seems so pointless.
I know you sacrificed a lot.
You do like to clear your debts.
- Who is it?
- Open the door.
Yeah, we know the drill.
Don't worry, I left my toys at home.
- She's clean.
- Told you.
Why aren't we keeping him down here?
Yeah, but look at him.
Unless he gets some juice soon, he's a goner.
Are you sure you're up to this?
I'm fine.
- So late that I had a lot of time to think.
- Did it hurt?
Maybe you should ask one of your goons for it.
You know there's still a leash law for junkyard dogs.
We don't have the vaccine.
What?
What the hell happened?
We ran into some complications.
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
I thought you were the best.
Don't I pay you to take care of complications?
If you don't like us, you can always use the A-Team you got here.
We still have the little matter of your debt.
I've worked enough to pay you back.
Are you joking?
Do I look like someone who jokes?
Do you remember the fricking mess you were when you came to me?
I remember how it was, but now, I think we're even.
Even?
So the way I see it, me and you ain't even close to being even.
You and me, we're done here.
So good luck.
Hope you find a great doctor to replace Matthews.
Too bad there aren't any within 500 kilometers from here.
I wish I could find someone to do that... but it seems everyone's busy getting jobs elsewhere.
We'll do it.
Fix up your tin-can Casanova.
But bring me any parts and ammo you find.
And no skimming.
You seemed awfully chummy back there.
I think so too, but we can't prove it.
And we didn't bring him back the vaccine.
So maybe we do owe him one more job.
You know who talks like that?
Junkies.
Matthews.
Matthews, you there?
Oh, all right.
Catch.
Another typical Two Horns paycheck.
He doesn't seem to understand... that these aren't as valuable as he thinks they are.
Oh, he understands.
Well, come on.
Take this.
You're hurt.
Let me take care of that.
All I want is a recharge.
- Were you?
- A doctor.
Now, let me see that.
Where is it?
To your health.
The power for my cell is low again.
Wish I knew more about your Hecatonchires system... because they're probably all related.
- Yeah, yeah, rub it in.
- Tough time to be a cyborg.
- Tough time to be anybody.
I swear that's your favorite part.
My job has its perks.
Hey, whatever happened with that?
You know, I've been trying to fix that thing ever since the day you brought it in.
I got the mechanical parts down, but the electronics are baffling.
I'll look for the owner's manual on my last job.
I thought that train job was your last one.
Weren't you always saying you wanted to get out of this town?
He's the guy we have to answer to.
Maybe this isn't my last job for Two Horns, but it'll be hers.
You should be the happiest man, or thing, or man-thing around.
Done.
It looks okay.
Get-well present.
- Watch it.
He just seems, I don't know, creepy.
Oh, it's on the house.
Just a little commemoration of your last job.
Thanks.
So how do you feel?
I'd tell you, but I wouldn't wanna geek out on you.
I heard the drones lost the ability to identify friendlies.
Now they just go after anyone.
We could ask the friendlies... but none of them ever came back.
You're so encouraging.
I am, aren't I?
Based on the footprints, it looks like multiple OSTRICH C-117s.
The worst type.
And there's a nest of them right there, near the intersection.
You see that circle of blasted-out cars?
And there's another one 50 meters east of that.
How do you know?
They keep in their spider hole, just pop up and shoot.
That's why all the remains are in a circle.
If they do leave the nest, they hunt in pairs.
What's their Achilles'?
- There's a girl with them.
- They don't know about the drones.
Goddamn it.
Come on.
Get her!
Come on.
You stay here.
Damn it.
Third one down.
And that would be four.
I'm coming down.
I've never seen anything like that.
Wherever you're from, your punks are highly-trained.
Maybe not punks, exactly.
Can you help us?
Good thing we were here cleaning up those drones.
It's quite a coincidence that you were, isn't it?
What's the matter?
- War changes things.
Maybe we should trust him.
One day, your trust is gonna get me in a lot of trouble.
I'll be gentle.
- Let's get on with it.
This is it.
A microchip blocking the self-assessment program.
It's a worm.
The whole thing caused your cooling system to eat up all your power.
Didn't stop you from taking out those drones, though.
- How is it?
- Show her.
That's great.
- You guys from around here?
- More or less.
Olson?
His name's Olson.
I was taught never to get in a car with a stranger.
Totally agree.
Thanks.
My name is Olson.
She's Iris.
You're cleaning up the drones from the war?
Yeah, but that's not our regular work.
We're cleaning up remaining war threats as well.
- Doesn't matter.
Right now, we have something we might need a little bit of help with.
Who the hell is that?
Probably the same people who don't want us to accomplish our task.
What do you think?
I think people like that would kill us just because we're with them.
So now we're stuck together.
They ran into some old drones.
Combat followed.
I need details.
From the footprint and shells, it looks like a heavy cyborg... with a high-powered sniper rifle that came from the city side.
- And they headed that direction.
And their two new friends?
Seems like they went with them.
- Let's get back to the city.
- We're not chasing them?
Whoever is helping them, they can take out the drones.
We need to know what we're up against.
Then I believe we should pay a visit to our friend downtown.
It's been a while since I saw one of those.
Who the hell is on it?
Good question.
With all the heavy firepower, you're lucky they didn't show up earlier.
You go get Iris.
Looks like we found some trouble, Bri.
How's she look?
She seems pretty tough to me.
I'm not sure how innocent she really is.
She's just trying to stay tough for their mission.
They believe it's an important one, don%they?
Yes, they do.
What?
Why didn't Matthews figure out something that Olson found instantly?
He told me he was a medic in the war, not a mechanic.
I guess.
Where are they?
Dead, maybe.
I gave them the easiest mission they've ever had.
Something's up.
Maybe they skipped town?
We made that impossible.
Go see what you can find out.
Seems we have a common interest.
How can that be?
What do you know about the girl?
- Don't play cute with me.
Where'd they take her?
Look, you know that there's no one as interested in keeping me alive as me... but I don't know what you talking about.
You employ a heavyweight cyborg, do you not?
Are you talking about Briareos?
- Is that what this is about?
- It's about the girl your cyborg kidnapped.
- Do you know?
- I don't.
Hey, beautiful, you think you can help me out?
He seems to be telling the truth.
Perhaps our paths have crossed one too many times.
And since I am looking to rebuild the world without people like you... it may be time we parted ways.
I doubt we will see each other again.
You're leaving the city?
So sorry to hear that.
It is not my departure you will mourn.
Should I call you a cab?
I was hoping it wouldn't go down this way.
This is gonna take some time.
Feel like some company?
You know, you're awfully young to be mixed up in trouble like this.
You know, we really did save your ass back there.
Is there a chance we ran into you guys and it was a coincidence?
I have no idea, so I would just rather not talk to you at all.
I understand that.
Are you guys soldiers?
You're gonna have to trust me sometime.
Give me a straight answer, you'll earn it.
What do you wanna know?
Who's in the chopper?
You ever hear of Triton?
I'm listening.
Talos used to be part of a team that I worked with.
Olympus.
If you trust in that, don't be surprised if I don't have any trust in you.
What's the mission?
That's classified.
Just when we were beginning to open up.
I am focused.
- Are you ready?
- We're good to go.
I'll navigate this time.
Okay.
Last night, the city's biggest criminal, Two Horns... was killed with the help of Triton.
With this major accomplishment... we can now start to rebuild our world one city at a time.
Beginning here, the world's greatest city, New York.
He was lucky, though.
Talos thinks he's dead.
That's probably lucky too.
Did you find Briareos?
We know which way they went.
Stop.
And desperate means...
I told you to be still now.
Just shut up and fix me!
You're welcome.
You should rest.
Smells like you're cooking again.
- You've got others.
- How'd it go?
Nobody's here anymore.
Probably deserted since the war.
Did you find out where they're from?
I'm not sure if I should tell you.
- So it's real.
- I doubt it.
He's clammed up about everything.
But Olson's parts...
- I've never seen anything like that.
- You haven't?
Did you find what you were looking for?
I'll take the first watch.
You try to get some sleep.
The stars seem brighter than before the war, don't you think?
- I don't really remember.
But I know deep down, he's still the same man I fell in love with.
He's still willing to fight for a good cause.
I hope so.
- Olson shouldn't have said anything.
I knew it.
But I do know the old way of doing things will not build a better future.
Without something like Olympus, mankind will fail.
I hate to break it to you, kid, but we failed.
And the weak just disappear.
People are greedy.
They want, money, land, power.
Whatever it is that makes them feel like they're better than someone else... or more important.
But it wasn't.
You can't stay undecided forever, Deunan.
- You have to make a choice.
- About what?
Either you accept the world as it is... or you work to build a better one.
We still have a long road ahead.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Okay.
Night.
Olympus.
- I've seen it before in the city.
Iris, get up.
- What is it?
- Trouble.
The chopper left for the city and now we see a tank.
- You know what that means.
But what kind of history could he have with Triton?
We good?
Here.
Thanks.
- Briareos.
- What is it?
You really are an optimist.
Come on.
City tanks are usually pretty agile, but this one seems slow.
You'd be slow too if you were carrying Two-Ton-Two-Horns around, right?
Good point.
Yeah, that's them, all right.
Why don't you give them a big fat hello?
He means business.
They disappeared from the screen but I don't think we got them.
Briareos doesn't have the power to be that mobile.
- Oh, yeah, I like that.
There he is.
He got away, chase him.
Sniper fire, 11 o'clock.
Do you think they'll be okay?
I think they're both very capable.
You're making me waste my ammo, you hunk of junk.
Holy shit!
I'm sick of his cat and mouse game.
Get the fast little honey out of the way now.
Stay here.
If something happens to me, tell them your mission.
They'll help you, I know it.
I know.
But you're gonna survive this.
Come on.
This way.
You little motherf'.
The rest of you, get back here.
Briareos.
I have a deal for you.
If you hand over the girl, I'll forgive you for running off.
Quite an offer, but I'll have to pass.
Okay, but then I'll just turn you into scrap and take the girl anyway.
And if you're scrap, you know what happens to Deunan.
So annoying.
- Olson.
- Who the hell was that?
Iris.
Bri was right.
You're not as innocent as you look.
Where's Olson?
I'm okay.
We make a good team.
I'm glad you think so.
We'll go get the car.
You still trust them?
She really saved our asses.
Still, better than doing jobs for Two Horns.
Just about anything is better than.
Iris.
Deunan!
Run, now.
No!
There goes your last hope.
You Okay?
Yeah.
My ear is ringing... but I think so.
Where are they?
They couldn't have gotten far.
Bri, they have a chopper.
I can still trace Olson's radio signal.
It's getting weaker, though.
You've been very hard to find.
All this effort for this?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do.
But I bet you will.
Where is the weapon?
It's over.
Always the same.
Making simple things... so very complicated.
You can't.
Take her west.
That city is an idea that will never work.
Just like her cries.
You're wrong, Talos.
Perhaps I am wrong.
No!
Olson!
No!
- You okay?
- Of course I'm okay.
- Where's the girl?
- Talos took her.
What the hell is going on?
Get Matthews on the line.
He's been nothing but trouble for me since he came to my city.
Now he humiliates me like that?
- We're kind of outgunned.
- You shut up and you man up!
It's on now.
The signal's getting stronger.
We're close.
There's nothing around here.
Olson.
No.
He's still dead.
Olson was a soldier.
He knew the risks.
I know, but...
You think he'd want it to end this way?
We finish what he started.
I don't think I can.
- What?
- It's too much.
I think I was wrong.
I was.
I was living moment to moment.
Not doing anything but surviving.
That's all we could do.
It's not.
Olson died for something he believed in.
It's time for us to change, Deunan.
What do you mean?
We need to make a choice.
But we have to try.
Okay.
We try.
His hand.
Bri, look.
What's on it?
Whatever it is, it was so important he was willing to die for it.
It never is.
After you.
I'll die before I tell you anything.
I can arrange that.
There's nothing here.
So it seems.
How did you know?
It's perfect.
Olson told me he and Talos worked together.
We need to make sure he never actually finds it.
It looks incomplete.
It's a prototype, you see?
Will it Work?
How did you know about it?
It speaks.
He and I were sent from Olympus to do postwar cleanup.
But to try and disarm the world?
So futile and what a terribly misguided notion.
- And you.
- I will never do anything to help you.
My only mission is to destroy that monster.
I've had enough of your Olympus nonsense.
What you fail to understand is that people love war.
It's human nature to romanticize war.
If we didn't, life would be so desperately boring, don't you think?
You and I are about to make this world very, very exciting.
Hang on.
Deunan?
So resilient.
Show them they're not.
Use the machines.
Iris.
Over there.
Talos have her?
They're bringing out the birds.
Friend or foe?
Two Horns?
This how you treat someone who just saved your ass?
What's your game?
I want the same thing you want.
Three eyes and you still can't see she doesn't like you.
A funny boy.
Seriously, don't quit your day job.
Matthews?
And friend.
- How's the power supply?
- I deserve that.
All I had to do was retract the turbo drive from the subsection of the main lift.
Then that K-12 that Briareos gave me really came in handy.
- Ready?
Go.
There's nothing we can do from here.
Look.
ALBS Arachnoid Class Land Battleship.
Serial number, 000.
System initiating.
Incredible.
It's sad you don't understand the reason why you were made.
Engine ignition begun.
All personnel should evacuate main chamber.
Iris.
Deunan.
Why can't I get this under my control?
Hull breach verified.
Self-defense system protocol initiated.
I think I like you.
Holy shit.
That thing is a monster.
No wonder Talos wanted it.
Inside that weapon.
But how are we gonna get up to it?
What do you mean "we"?
Trust me.
Briareos.
Gotta be a weak spot somewhere.
She's a little tight, but I'll make it fit.
Fire all missiles.
- Are you on?
- Kind of.
- Where's Two Horns?
- I don't know.
I couldn't get close enough, but you're in my range.
I'll back you up from here.
You can do it.
- Thanks for dropping in.
- Two Horns?
Can you throw me into that hole?
You think I'm heavy?
That's another debt you owe me!
Leave it alone.
I thought you only wanted to control the weapon, not use it.
I've changed my mind.
Once they understand the power I wield.
It'll never work.
Deunan.
And Briareos?
Good.
Any way to stop this thing?
I'm trying.
This Fortress won't stop until it reaches New York City.
This weapon is programmed for retribution.
Why?
In case the country fell to its enemy.
- I know a way.
- She's here.
Fortress right on course.
Almost in position.
You're the last one.
Go out big, baby.
If we take out one more cannon, it should create a large enough opening for you.
No, it didn't.
Briareos, can you see the target?
Fifteen more seconds.
Get the hell out of there now.
Deunan.
Iris, open the door.
We gotta get out, now.
What's going on?
Open it, now.
This machine will regenerate its shields unless I stay and keep them down.
I'm losing my window.
I am a bioroid.
I was made for this mission.
Good bye.
We're out.
Well done, Iris.
There's so much I wanted to tell you.
You gave me a reason.
You gave me hope.
So, what's the take?
Not much.
Deunan, she died for something she believed in.
Knowing that doesn't make it any easier.
It never does.
So where you off to now?
To find Olympus.
Olympus?
- You know, we still have a debt to settle.
- You have got to be joking.
Do I look like someone who jokes?
Just my way of saying thanks for getting my city back.
- I thought it was destroyed.
- Nothing I couldn't handle.
Now, drive carefully.
Traffic has been terrible lately.
Oh, and wear your seat belt.
I hear there was a law once.
I guess not.
Well, there's always hope.
We lost Iris.
I know she was your bioroid.
I'm sorry.
- And her mission?
- It is complete.
The prototype is destroyed.
And the humans who helped, should we retrieve them?
Others who are worthy are sure to follow.
She said that Norman has blacked out twice when he's been with her.
Don't lie again!
You told her something happens to me when I black out.
I'm not gonna answer your question, and I don't want you to ever ask me again.
Morning.
Coffee's fresh.
Is there something the matter?
Bye, Sheriff.
Good morning.
Yeah, ah, I'd like to, even though we've seen it about a hundred times, but...
Hello, Norma.
I'm old-fashioned that way.
He does.
That's between him and me.
Don't you talk to your son about anything?
Not so much about work.
I don't like what he does.
I'm not asking you to get your hands dirty.
All you need to do is tell him that we need to meet.
If for no other reason, you need to see him and fix that.
I can tell you, it's the most horrible thing that ever happened to me.
You recognize any of these guys?
All these people, low-level workers.
All right, I want you to find where Zane Morgan is.
Put every resource we got on it.
Tell me where he is.
Jodi!
You just sit up here all day long and play with your stupid little plants.
What we need to do is figure out what the hell we're gonna do.
The thing you need to do is lay low somewhere.
You know where to go.
You're gonna see.
What do you want?
Didn't recognize you.
It's down this way here.
I, uh, I came to see you.
About?
Well, nothing really, except that I met him at a party, and he started helping me figure out how to stop the bypass, and now he wants a favor from me.
What favor?
I mean, I don't like the marijuana part, but I'm glad you're doing so well.
Tell him you couldn't find me, okay?
Are you around weed all the time?
You know, cannabinoids can actually get absorbed into all sorts of different parts in your body.
I can't.
I can't believe it!
I need to know if you're interested in this being anything else, so I can stop making an idiot out of myself.
Yes, sir.
You think I wanted any of this to happen?
So soft, just like it's real.
It is soft.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Uh, well, she was my teacher, so...
Yeah, but I mean, did you know anything else about her?
- But why mostly?
But for a school project, so it's not...
Because I'm wondering, did you ever sleep with her?
Because she was my teacher, and I was very upset about her death.
I thought if I cut her off, she'd come back.
She and I'd had a falling out six months earlier.
I was trying to get her to come home.
There's nothing more important.
Norma, you're not being smart here.
How dare you?
Who do you think got you that seat on the City Council?
Okay, but you didn't answer.
I'm gonna meet someone for dinner.
I'm meeting George for dinner.
I won't wait up.
That way I know you can't shoot me, and I can't be spotted with you, so it's gonna have to be someplace outside of White Pine Bay.
I'll see you then.
You look beautiful.
Been at Brown for two years and just got a little fed up with the lifestyle of the privileged.
So I applied for a job that I didn't know how to do, and I faked it.
Got thrown off a horse.
You okay?
What's Brown?
- Florida.
Norma, dinner's ready.
My husband didn't own an insurance company, and my family was a mess.
For future reference, Dylan, in business, as in life in general, pleasantries are an important part of how people communicate.
It helps us to find common ground, but I sense you're not comfortable being here, maybe even a little out of your depth.
What about him?
You do that, and this all stops right here.
You need to do it.
Is your family?
'Cause that's what's going to rain down on you.
We're done talking.
What are you doing?
Jury just came back.
What do we do about what?
About Norman Bates, and the fact that his semen sample matched, that he had sex with her the night that she was killed, and nobody but us knows about this.
George not feeling well?
Yeah, the movie that you said you'd seen a hundred times that I wanted to go to with you.
Sometimes it's just nice to watch a movie alone, you know?
All distant, like you couldn't be bothered with me.
- No, I do understand!
I understand that you're not who I thought you were.
The game was that we were devoted to each other, and no one could ever come between us, that we loved each other more than anyone could ever love another person.
Norman, unlock the door.
I have the key, mother.
I won't stay out here!
Norma, what are you doing?
You came back.
Yeah, I came back.
Yeah, help yourself.
Nick Ford's not gonna sell his business and move to Hawaii.
All right, if we don't figure out how to stop this, he's gonna slaughter everybody who's ever worked for us.
From common sense.
He's totally out of his mind.
My life's at stake here too.
You can leave now.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
If you need to do something about Zane, you can do it.
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
I will never forgive you for this.
Henry, you're not well.
It's true, Father's army would failon its own... but two armies...
It took almost everything we had, but we beat them back.
Between the constant attacks and desertions, we won't be able to hold the line.
The Dauphin of France.
Stand when you address him.
The English have been on our soil in Calais for two centuries.
The English know that.
That's why they keep attacking, taking a few of us each time, until we can't fight anymore and are forced to retreat.
We're in danger of losing this war if we don't act.
The soldiers that you repelled this morning come from the castle of Montmorency.
That castle stands between us and our route to Calais.
If we take it, we clear the way.
But there's 12 of us.
All the men along the line will advance as well.
We need to get you to safety.
So much for advancing to a bloody castle.
We missed you at breakfast.
It's not healthy to spend so much time alone.
I know you parted on painful terms.
Thousands of Frenchmen would have died otherwise.
Do all married couples have these struggles?
I think you've redefined marital discord.
Your Grace, pardon my intrusion, but there's an urgent letter for you.
Ah, my cousins!
What circumstances are those?
Usually you time your visits around Henry's availability.
Except for the day when he left you in tears because he decided to marry me.
Oh, life is full of surprises, isn't it?
Mary, Queen of Scotland.
I remember you as a child.
So talkative, free with words.
Catherine, could I have a private word with you?
Mary, what is it?
It's no longer a case of fighting them.
If she has any hope of survival, she needs to escape in secret.
If anyone knows how terrifying that is, it is you.
- I don't...
How were you going to support yourself in exile?
You and my mother were friends once.
Catherine, I beg of you!
It invites sympathy, then pity, then disdain.
Give the impression that you're weak, and you'll soon need a secret fund.
Who's there?
I wondered when you'd get here.
You weren't seen?
Your uncle's for one?
I would have preferred to have not used your services, but I gave Catherine the option of being a human being and saving a life, and she refused.
Was that wise?
Considering you're about to steal it?
Fair enough.
I'll have it for you in two days.
I won't have blood spilled if that's what you're intending.
I can't be expected to finish my job with half my tools.
You will keep me apprised before any serious action is taken.
Leave everything to me.
And she's been sulky ever since.
Also, my cousin Hortensa is here.
There's nothing that you can do.
Is that as good as you've got?
Lola!
Are you all right?
It's just a cramp.
We need to take care of you.
We'll stop and rest here.
I told him you were a good luck charm.
Who'd kill the Dauphin of France?
We were safe with you.
Oh, you're wise not to speak, though it tells me more than you think.
For one thing, this has nothing to do with the war.
If it did, our negotiations would be much more in the open.
You'd be boasting about your English superiority.
And for another, it tells me that you don't intend to kill me... at least not yet.
Money?
And since you got into the castle so easily, you either work there... unlikely... or you're a mercenary, hired to kidnap me for someone else.
Someone close to me, in desperate need of funds, who has long had it in for me.
A young queen, perhaps?
The good news is, you've chosen your victim wisely.
Do we have a deal?
Oh, there you go, that's a nice kick.
Rest here a bit.
Thank you, Agnes.
Would you like more water?
Another pillow?
You're sharing a bed with two of us, one who steals the covers and the other one kicks and turns all night.
Perhaps I should sleep in my quarters this evening.
You've been so kind to me.
When I think of how things might have gone for me...
I'd be facing moments like this alone, save for some cold nuns around me, judging me.
I am a bit scared about giving birth.
I think you'll be in better hands with your lady friends.
I want to hold your hand.
You make me feel safe.
I always want to be there for you.
That's not the same as saying you'll be with me.
You have a strength you have yet to realize.
What do you mean, the queen has been kidnapped?
I would keep your voice down, unless you're trying to alert the entire country to the vulnerability of Henry's court.
Someone slipped this note under my chamber door ten minutes ago.
"20,000 francs to be delivered to the base of the Louis XI obelisk by sundown tomorrow."
In case you want to do anything about it.
If we bowed to their demands, we would never be safe.
It will take days to get word to him in Paris, long after the deadline.
Either Catherine's kidnappers intend to return her alive... in which case, they'll certainly wait a few days for the ransom... or they don't.
In which case, there's really no rush to do anything.
My God.
The kidnappers intend to return Catherine alive, but in pieces.
Did you see the men who attacked us this morning?
I saw them before, twice.
They strike fast and withdraw to deceive us into thinking that the castle is too strong to take.
Soon it will be too strong.
Kenna told me that you were unwell, that it might be the baby.
You don't look fine.
The dowry was transferred to my husband two days ago.
The money Julien has been waiting for has arrived and is in his grasp.
Legally, he's owed it.
But... why would he, why would any man, marry a girl pregnant with another man's child unless he was going to get something out of it?
And what if those two people fell in love anyway?
If the end of your story is a happy one, then does how it began really matter?
I hope Lord Castleroy is your happy ending.
Do you think of Leith often?
Every day.
Fire!
The English have placed a wagon full of gunpowder next to the cannon, for ease of reloading.
One flaming arrow, well-aimed, would take it out, as well as the entire English squad.
You won't make it ten feet out of these trees before you're blown to pieces.
I don't view you as chess pieces.
Then prove it.
If we stay here and do nothing, it will pound us to pieces.
But if we advance, dispersed and on the move, the English won't know who to target.
It is the best chance for most of us to survive.
Greer told Lola not to worry about Julien, but I worry.
You don't want to pick this marriage apart.
You know.
Some cad who can't take responsibility.
And as her friend, I want to help her do that.
You said you would keep me apprised before any serious action was taken.
I've spilled no blood.
The queen is fine.
Besides, your orders were to get the money as quickly as possible.
I wouldn't succeed in my line of work if it were known that I could be turned so easily.
The queen has no way of proving you're responsible.
Except for the innocent soul who dies in my stead.
If you're worried about innocence, then choose someone who isn't.
You hired a mercenary to kidnap Catherine?
I didn't mean for it to go that far, but yes.
Now, to get out of it, I have to pin the crime on someone else.
I don't know what I'm capable of anymore, to be frank.
But there is one possibility.
For months I've been trying to figure out which of Catherine's men participated in the massacre of my countrymen at the brothel.
Some time ago, I paid a servant to track down one of the prostitutes who escaped to find some descriptions of the men involved.
According to the prostitute, one of the men had a scar on his left cheek from brow to chin.
Lots of men have scars.
He also badly burned his hands after the massacre.
That's why you came to me.
You killed someone in the woods when the pagans forced you to choose a sacrifice.
Was he really as guilty as I thought at the time?
And what's the answer?
Oh, I couldn't help but notice you speaking with Catherine's guard.
You mean my guard.
I lent Catherine my men some time ago.
Why do you ask?
I, um, wanted to employ him to help me find Catherine.
The whorehouse massacre.
You're trying to gauge my involvement in the slaughter of your countrymen.
Well, I had nothing to do with it.
I loaned Catherine those men long before she planned the incident.
Are you threatening me?
Let's just say I can't have either of you bearing false witness to Henry when he returns.
But Catherine must be taught to stay out of my affairs.
Assuming she makes it back to the castle.
- Lola mentioned it.
He didn't request hunting gear of any kind.
Did you do as I asked?
I don't believe it.
Answer carefully.
You'll find proof of what I've said when you return to the castle.
Now, where's the gold?
There's a chest of gold in an empty sarcophagus, beneath the apse of the Church of St. Isabelle.
Be fast.
Sir, they're advancing!
God save us all.
Where's Leith?
He was behind me.
Bash found his lack of interest in hunting supplies quite odd, yes.
Oh, he's going to leave me.
I was just checking in on your beautiful bride.
Thank you, Kenna.
And I'm going to sleep in my quarters this evening so you get it.
And the hunting trip?
Don't.
Julien, please hear me.
I want you.
And you can keep me for much less than you might imagine.
I wish you could believe that.
Who could believe that of a girl like you?
You're everything I ever dreamed of.
Get back!
I want every entrance to the castle locked down till further notice.
You expect me to believe you know nothing of this?
No, I swear.
Organize a search of Hortensa's rooms and those of Mary, Queen of Scots.
Over here!
See that they send a rider to the Duke of Guise, telling him that the way is open, but it may not be for long.
Hurry... the war is all but won if we press our advantage.
You should go as well.
There must be someone that you'll fight to see again.
Not yet, anyway.
But she's above my station.
It's one of the better aspects of being king, because, trust me, some of them are far less enjoyable.
Why wouldn't I?
Because you're merely a chess piece?
I have lost good men, and I'm not prepared to sacrifice any more, especially if I can help it.
Roman De Medici, Your Grace.
Turns out she was penniless.
According to that letter, she had been paying vast sums for years to keep the secret.
That's why she came here and held you for ransom.
For a moment, what I thought had escaped my notice was Mary, Queen of Scots.
I warned her not to beg, not to look weak.
You think she arranged all this?
I think she's capable of all of it, except the murder of Hortensa.
It takes time for a woman to grow that hard.
I was nearly 30 when I killed an innocent.
I suppose innocence is all relative.
Go on.
I am about as close to penniless as a son of a wealthy family could ever be.
I wasn't thinking clearly.
You said you didn't want to be alone, that fear made you want me at your side.
All I have to offer you... is me.
With time.
Promise me: no more lies.
I promise.
This is just a sample.
The rest is hidden safely, awaiting your instructions.
And Hortensa's body?
Buried safely, with a forged letter planted in her chambers
I took her head quickly, if that brings you peace.
But I've been at court long enough to know how the Medicis work, and how they act.
Her guard confirmed it.
I traded one life for another today.
- Count yourself lucky it was bought so cheaply, Your Grace.
There would be a substantial purse in it for you, as well, of course.
Follow me.
These men used to work for Hortensa, until their mistress lost her head, and now they work for me.
Indeed they are... but they're my monsters now.
Ali goes rogue and we're just expected to back up her story?
I killed her, Emily, and I don't know how I'm gonna be able to live with that.
Shana had been using us as target practice for months.
Jason, why were you in New York?
Are you okay?
Can we get you something?
But, Mr. DiLaurentis...
Do you want me to help you get dressed?
I don't know.
I don't want to see any police... not at the funeral, not at the cemetery.
Yeah, but how is she?
Question is, who buried Ali's mom in Spencer's backyard?
It wasn't Jason.
She's not the only one we have to worry about.
I just wanted to wear something of hers.
She wore it to your funeral.
The four of you have had a very stressful week.
I want you to know how legitimately relieved we all are that you're safe and what it means to have you back in the halls of Rosewood High School.
I think we understand that.
As I told your parents, the school will protect you from the press and the curious.
We appreciate that, Mr. Hackett.
But there are limits to what we can do under these unusual circumstances.
I need to know that you will do your part to keep the disruptions to a minimum.
We have to at least act like things are normal.
We can't pretend forever.
Real as in who hit Alison that night and who killed Mrs. D.
We're all thinking the same person.
Really, did you start reading minds?
Hanna found the email where Mrs. DiLaurentis was telling him she couldn't protect him anymore.
We don't know that.
Do you want to do a trip to Philadelphia tonight?
Mr. Fitz's get-well card.
We all have to be careful how others see us.
I heard you were floating around with this.
Well, they said that he was shot in the stomach, so I thought flowers.
Ah, good choice.
All that drama and danger and suspense.
Couldn't be more exciting if she made up the whole thing.
She said that Ezra's back in Rosewood.
Are you sorry about anything else?
Nice having Emily back, isn't it?
Can I help you with something?
So why don't you take a really good look, and we can all move on with our lives, okay?
You must miss it.
Please?
Don't let them catch you looking.
Nothing so rustic.
More like the Borgias and the Medicis.
That ended pretty nasty as well, too.
People are capable of all sorts of things under the right pressures.
Well, there's plenty of pressure right here in this house.
Why did you lie about seeing him in London when you hadn't?
On a practical level, there's no difference between me seeing him and knowing he was there.
Then on a practical level, why lie about it?
I was trying to keep Wren out of it.
Mom and Dad are worried enough without me dragging him back into things.
And who do you think they're more worried about, me or you?
She's back in the bosom of what's left of her family.
Now stay away from her and the rest of them.
He could have just dropped the damn visitation book at my house.
God, I hate these places.
All these people I didn't know standing around crying, me choking on the smell of flowers.
No.
That's why I wanted to give you that in person.
It used to be a little easier to tell us apart, wasn't it?
Sad, sad, sad.
That's not good.
They say the longer someone's missing the less likely they'll ever come back.
You look different.
Probably just put a blank space instead of a picture.
If Alison's really gone, someone has to take her place.
What do you mean, "If she's really gone"?
The secret to becoming unforgettable.
The police still consider it an active crime scene.
What's gonna happen when the tape comes down?
How would you feel about selling the house?
You know, when you sell a house, don't you have to inform the buyer of things like mold and termites and dead bodies?
Sometimes complicated problems have simple solutions, Spencer.
Well, it's not her job to point them in his direction.
For all of us.
Somebody already dug a hole.
My counselor says that's... post-surgical mind-body dysphoria.
It's supposed to go away, though.
Do you know everything that's happened with Alison?
Only what I've seen on the TV.
She told the police that she was kidnapped and that you found her in Philadelphia.
Is that the story you all agreed upon?
Well, it's the story that she told, so...
And I thought Shana did it, but the timing doesn't really work out.
Have you heard from her at all since you've been back?
No.
You have to be careful then, because she's clearly still out there.
Yeah, I wanted to see you.
I watched your videos.
Because you're taller than me?
No, it's not the height, it's your ratio.
Of what to what?
Stand up against the locker, touch the floor with your middle finger.
Okay, now reach up with your other hand and stretch out as far as you can.
Should I be taking something for that?
Just adjust your stroke rate.
Try it.
It fits.
It's better that he doesn't.
Mona and Ezra know that you weren't kidnapped, Ali.
But Ezra doesn't look at the world the way Mona does.
Ezra's not a bad guy, Aria.
He's just too romantic for his own good.
That's probably why you fell for him.
Okay, I really don't need you analyzing my personality right now.
Do you need anything else?
Shana tried to kill Ezra, and she would have killed all of us if you didn't stop her.
Hey, you girls looking for a sub-let still?
We weren't really honest with you the last time we were here.
No kidding.
He says that you're a regular customer and a good tipper.
Three pies, two, three times a week.
You feeding an army in there?
What kind of army orders all that pizza and no beer to go with it?
I need to make amends for something.
If anybody wants me, they'll find me.
I decided I didn't like it.
He was at that dry-out place with no less than half a dozen people the night his mom died, and we were in New York.
So he's in the clear.
I mean, what was it like to stop being one thing and then just become something else?
I wasn't becoming something else.
I was becoming who I really am.
You always knew?
That time stamp means that your mother wrote that 2 hours after the last time anybody saw her at that police station.
And she never finished writing it.
She didn't even enter an address to whom she meant to send.
Maybe she changed her mind.
What would make her do that?
So she got up from her computer, she walked out the front door and she went to go tell somebody that Ali was alive and that things were falling apart faster than anybody could fix them.
Maybe that person, the person she was writing to, the one that she couldn't protect anymore, maybe that's who killed her.
There's a creaky saying you hear a lot at the meetings:
Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?
So was I.
I'm glad you didn't.
Why are you here, Alison, with that?
Aria let me read it.
Not all of it.
If there was anything left, the only thing preventing me from burning it is the possibility that it would help Aria, if she would let me help.
Well, then you better keep it in a safe place.
Absolute honesty?
I have to maintain a consistent level.
Well, it's the truth, isn't it?
You didn't help me, you changed me.
You made me dye my hair, you made me wear her clothes, you made me walk like her, talk like her.
And exactly how much pushback did I get from you on that?
If I hadn't given you the Ali upgrade, where would you be?
I'd still be me.
And who remembers her?
Not even you.
Well, crazy, as you know, around here works on a sliding scale.
They wouldn't do anything about that, would they?
That's a very interesting question, and I will have to get back to you on it.
But somebody else could have gone and done that.
No, not really.
Yeah, I need to know that it didn't happen.
I can't hide in my room forever.
Even if I'm still scared I have to get out or else I never will.
But I know my way around this town better than any cop.
I can get out if I want to.
Does my mom know you're out here?
We're done fighting.
Which makes us what?
We go to the same school, we used to be teammates, maybe we'll be friends.
I'm pretty convincing.
Then I get to this porch and I forget everything.
All I can say is, "I love you."
Like if I say it just right, it'll fix things.
Somehow you'll hear it differently this time and everything will be all right.
Where have you been at this hour, young man?
You know the world's in a sorry state when I have to make a secret out of eating salt.
Who was she trying to protect and why did she suddenly feel like she had to stop?
Was it because Alison was alive?
Who was she writing this to?
Leave him alone.
We're having a conversation.
I know what your idea of a conversation is.
You can't lie about something you don't know anything about.
I just heard a knock on the door and I thought it might be you.
Yeah, I was kind of thinking the same thing.
Look, Ezra, I didn't just come over here to warn you about Alison.
How can I help?
It's time for a change.
...the town of Jupiter is in the grips of terror for a second week, from four unsolved murders and a child who remains missing.
Schools stand like mausoleums, their attendance drastically declined, as parents keep their children safely home.
Nobody else seems to be open.
And we have learned, though this report has not yet been confirmed, that one of their own, possibly a Jupiter police detective, has himself been missing for two days.
You take care of the body like we talked about?
Who's the proprietor of this, uh, freak show?
We have nothing to hide.
But I cannot allow you to look around without a search warrant.
My monsters cherish their privacy.
You can see all we have to offer with a ticket to the show.
This town is shutting down at night till the killer's caught.
Or is it... patients?
Did you expect them to move in?
We like to get statements from anyone involved in a murder investigation.
I smelled whiskey.
We're such easy targets, aren't we?
Shut... up!
I never killed nobody before.
I wanted to protect us and instead, I created a shit-storm of trouble.
He called us freaks.
I hate that word.
No better, no worse, just... regular people.
That's what we gotta do let 'em know us.
That's what you ordered-- escargot.
That boy's working my last nerve.
I'm still having nightmares about the debacle with the Cushing girl--
But what about a grandbaby?
Babies are more boring than anything.
It's not our world, Dandy.
You come from a long line of such fine people-- generation after generation of refinement.
Where are you going?
I don't know-- maybe St. Petersburg, where they have real caramel corn, not that cardboard they sell at the freak show.
We'll play June Allyson paper dolls, or whatever you'd like!
I found some of those, uh, parts... behind the tool shed.
There was some fur and teeth, and neighbors been stopping by all day, looking for their cat.
He's just bored.
Speak for yourself.
Around here, we sing for our supper.
Somebody I used to know.
Please tell me this is a rest stop.
This ad was placed months ago.
Well, we had to close out our Midwest engagement before we could get down here.
You were with the Giuseppe Brothers of Chicago, you say?
Last six years.
Dell Toledo... the Stupendous Strong Man!
You probably heard of me.
Those greasy Giuseppe Brothers never understood that.
They had her opening up for some lousy animal acts.
I couldn't stand the stink of it.
So I loaded up our caravan and I took my girl out of there.
I never dreamed that I would ever be able to do this with a real woman.
There ain't murder if there ain't no body.
"Us freaks"?
Three titties, proper girl parts and a ding-a-ling.
I'm a full blown hermaphrodite.
Put that on your banner.
My word.
I couldn't afford a couple of your renown.
We're a vanishing breed.
You turn us away, there's no place left for us to go.
Show me your hands.
Strong hands.
Calloused.
Maybe what this place needs is a strong male presence.
I'll pay you handsomely for it.
Well, it ain't bad, but the kids, they really like those prizes that come in the boxed stuff.
That's because they haven't tasted this!
I truly believe this is where I belong.
I've been ruminating on my life and what I want.
This is the perfect place for me.
Well, unless you got pony legs under those trousers or a double ding dong...
What you're looking at-- that's not who I am inside.
I'm one of you.
I'll prove it.
You'd be saving my life.
You know what I wouldn't give to have real hands like yours?
To be able to touch a girl without scaring her?
From where I'm sitting you got the world on a string.
So, you go home to your mansion on the hill, and you thank God for all you got.
I hate it here.
I hate this house.
Nonsense, you just need a little companionship.
Maybe a new friend.
Ethel, you look good.
How's the old soup catcher?
I would've expected to see some gray in it by now.
Jimmy who?
I'm gonna save you a lot of pain.
I never want to see you ever again.
And I sure as hell didn't come here for you.
I'm married now.
You wouldn't know a real lady from a goat's ass.
You sure that's the way you want to address your new boss?
You'll never be my boss.
I simply pointed out security around this place is a little lax.
You wouldn't want nothing wandering in or wandering out.
Please, no more.
I thought you said you could sing?
I'm going to have to find something else for you to do.
Like what?
Please, Miss Elsa.
This senorita, could shoot ping pong balls right out of her...
That's true.
Whatever you want.
Sing it to me.
When logic loosens its vice grip and the imagination comes out to play.
The night allows the stars to shine and we come alive.
Clowns and kewpie dolls.
She's your boss now.
No lady is the boss of me.
Why don't we go outside and calm down, huh?
There will be paying asses in these seats tomorrow!
Curtain goes up at 3:00.
That man is going to be a problem.
Yul Brynner was transcendent.
You're right, of course.
Puppetry is a sad cousin to a live performance.
I like real puppets like you.
Amuse me, clown.
Your silence is utterly provocative.
But you'll have to earn your keep, clown.
Come!
Find a toy, and show me what kind of clown you truly are.
Excuse me, miss?
W-What do you want?
Napkins on the lap.
Well, I'm sure she'd love the show if she saw it.
Tell the ticket lady Jimmy sent you.
We're ready to order now.
What do you want?
Salisbury steak should hit the spot.
Uh, what are you having, Pepper?
Meat loaf.
Um, excuse me.
That's not yours.
Let me guess.
This was your bright idea.
But that's not his food.
I'm gonna have to bus this plate.
She was gonna throw it out anyway.
Like this?
I have the right to refuse service.
I said, let's go.
Try this.
We're never getting out.
Now we have a chance.
Just be ready to run.
Please, the clown, he's crazy!
Clown, look what I have for you.
You'll have to do a much better job of confinement if we're going to have any fun.
Barging into a lady's tent unannounced?
I take it you refer to our new strongman.
You know he's out putting matinee posters all over town, after you asked him not to?
Perhaps it's for the best.
Or hold it together.
If the killer who stalks this town is not soon caught, the people will seek out scapegoats.
I think for now, it's good to have a man of strength among us.
He was gonna take the twins, Elsa.
He threatened to run us out of town or worse.
Not just me.
See where he's got you billed?
He's got to go.
Well, hold onto your seats, ladies and gents, because today, for the first time ever, you will have the privilege of watching a song and dance act by our brand new headliners!
Ladies and gentlemen, from the exotic land of Siam, the Spectacular Siamese Sisters!
We have a warrant to search the premises for evidence pertaining to the disappearance of Detective Robert Bunch.
On what grounds, Officer?
We received an anonymous tip.
We have reasons to believe he was murdered here.
Hey, hold on, pal.
We already got an earful about what a Boy Scout you were, from Chicago PD.
I'm telling you-- there's nothing in there.
Nobody moves a muscle until we search every tent here!
Tear this place apart!
There was no way the cops were ever gonna find what you left behind in my trailer.
This is Detective Bunch's badge.
Take this freak to the station.
You like to diddle little kiddies, you sick freak?
I heard they found the toy store owner with his fingers missing.
I came to congratulate you on your triumph tonight.
They loved her, not me.
You talking in your sleep?
My angel.
What's it look like I'm doing?
You had nothing to do with that.
The police had no right, roughing you up like that.
I just wanted him gone.
I gotta tell them.
He's not tough.
He's just weird.
Tell who what?
I can't lose him.
Believe me, Gloria, it's the furthest thing from my mind, but apparently not from from yours.
Dandy's always been a willful child.
I often thought of him as a foreigner.
A perfectly groomed aristocratic boy who could play the part but didn't quite understand the language.
Because words had a different meaning for him.
Particularly the word "no".
"No" was an affront.
"No" was a battle cry.
Of course, I knew he had to socialize with children.
The boy never learned to play.
He found a perfect companion with the gardener's son, Emil.
Beautiful little boy.
They would roam the grounds together, happy as clams.
I relaxed, thinking my vigil had become unnecessary.
One day, the boy vanished.
They searched everywhere for him.
Gloria, were there any recent incidents...
- That triggered this anxiety about your son.
- Just a mother's intuition.
Maybe a coyote.
God put his very own light into that little angel.
We will mourn her.
I've seen you bring a full house to their feet, but you have never been better than you were tonight.
Clutching her bloody dress-- that was a nice touch.
She was my most precious one.
All that's precious to you is the roar of the crowd.
And God forbid someone comes along and steals your spotlight.
I heard those stories... ten times over, Elsa.
How when I'd leave here at night I'd just... felt like I lost something.
Now I know.
Who am I, if not your savior, huh?
And this is the thanks.
Just don't ask for top billing.
What about the twins?
And you, you didn't even blink.
I died when I heard you say that.
You killed me dead.
It was a turn of phrase.
But I will be judged on my actions, and not on my words.
No way.
No, I made sure they were safe somewhere away from you.
Yes, I wanted them to be gone.
But I never hurt anyone.
Although, for me, death would be preferable to Tampa.
And I will no longer suffer your insults and your insanity!
I love you because I understand you.
You... don't know me at all.
A sweet young soldier with a kind heart found me and brought me to my safety.
His name was Massimo Dolcefino.
He found his fame in the first World War when grenades became the great terror, separating soldiers from their limbs.
Why'd you keep it a secret from me?
I was humiliated, ashamed.
Can't you see how deep it is?
Ethel... put the gun away.
Curtain comes down tonight.
You broke my heart in two, Elsa.
I loved you.
I gave my life to you.
Jimmy, your own son?
He'll survive.
I left him a letter, it's in the carrion.
For all of us.
So be it.
But first... one last schnapps for the road?
Go on.
We've never shared a drink before, have we?
I'm sorry, you won't be going to Hollywood, Elsa.
That is what we are trying to determine.
I was out in the woods, picking flowers for Ma Petite's memorial grave.
Why can't we just hang her in her caravan and be done with it?
This accident is gonna cover a whole host of sins, all of them yours.
This is a magic trick.
We have to divert the attention of the audience in order to pull off the illusion.
I have an obligation to-to protect you, protect your career.
You have a destiny, written in the stars, to be a star.
Hello, Mrs. Mott.
I came to see my mother.
Dora went to buy the squash.
You understand, dear.
These days, the only way to procure a proper squash is to venture down to Homestead, to the Klingmans'.
That horrid hurricane completely destroyed the Tabernathys' farm in Pompano, and it's been simply impossible to consume the squash from that region ever since.
My mother went to buy... squash?
I'll wait.
A flat tire, a leaky faucet.
My mother could fix anything.
She was famous for her dirty jokes.
"Are you nobody, too?
She was tough, funny.
She didn't need a man to... take care of her or her child.
She was a survivor from the day she was born.
Nobody handed her nothing.
I know you all know what I'm talking about.
You think the law might have anything to say about it?
Let me tell you something, ladies.
That girl, she's every last one of us.
Who's with me?
And... this one?
I'm bored.
What's my score?
Mother said you wanted to test my genius IQ.
It'll take more than one visit to determine that.
I'd like to see you two times a week.
I've been reading in National Geographic about the natives of Papua New Guinea.
They would go to war with a neighboring tribe, and when they conquered them, the winners would eat the vanquished tribe's best warriors, and then their medicine man, and then their chief.
Tell me, do you think it's possible to take someone's power by eating their flesh?
Or could you do it just by... bathing in their blood?
You lied to me, Mother.
Dr. Feinbloom had no interest in measuring my genius IQ.
All he wanted to do was listen to me talk.
I'll strike you a bargain, Mother.
I'll go back to see Dr. Feinbloom.
In fact, I'll go for an entire month.
You're a horrible liar, Mother.
She can see through every one of your stupid stories.
Regina wants to send me to the electric chair.
Isn't it beautiful?
This place is the worst.
You have a pretty face.
We summer in Bedford.
I despise every minute of it.
So they sent you down here to reduce?
You should see Mother at Thanksgiving dinner.
Every time I take a bite, she sees red.
You are a hedonist, a lover of the physical world.
We take care of our own.
You.
My sisters.
I ain't hungry.
Every woman in this place took turns caring for you.
I showed you how to hold an audience and to be a leader, but clearly I failed in that department.
You're nothing but a load of wind.
How could you not come to the funeral?
This is Barbara.
Though I have given her the stage name of Ima Wiggles.
Come in, dear.
Nice to meet you.
You are no good to us without your figure.
You see, that's how it works.
Your mother lives because the show will always go on.
You're late.
This party is over.
I've been telling you this forever, Elsa.
This world is dying, and all the fat ladies and lizard girls in the world ain't gonna change that.
I am trying to help you!
Look at her.
You're sick, Elsa.
This pot pie is heaven.
You proof enough of that.
What you done to your little girl... that was chickenshit.
Penny...
Drop his drawers!
Holy shit.
This is freak women only.
And is this what it means to be a freak woman?
What would you know about it, anyway?
I know that if you do this, it will change you.
Then he wins!
Look at you.
Pretty little white girl.
You got no idea what it's like, always living on the outside, looking in through a window, seeing all the things you can never have because they say so.
You don't know what chances you might have left.
I am the Astounding Lizard Girl.
You get to live only because I say so.
But you come near me or mine ever again... and I will kill you.
Mrs. Mott, I don't think this is wise.
Dandy may seem durable, but he's actually quite fragile.
Thank you, Doctor.
We won't be needing your services any longer.
Well, if I am unbalanced, it's your fault.
Dora told me everything when I was five.
Your father was wiped out by the crash of '29, and you would have done anything to get back to a home like this.
Even marrying your second cousin.
I loved your father.
I was born of deadly sin.
You knew what Father had done to those little girls.
You knew the risks of breeding with your cousin.
I'm not going to Europe.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
How can I possibly be with a woman who hates me so much?
Even the madness.
I have no more love to give.
You have tapped me out.
It's time for this madness to end.
Why would I want to do that?
Well, for one thing, you're supposed to be in charge around here.
But you can't do that passed out behind the Ferris wheel or wallowing over here.
You sound like some old schoolmarm.
I'm the girl who fell in love with a leader.
Look... you need to eat something.
Listen to me, Jimmy.
You didn't do anything wrong.
You're assuming that you could have saved your mother, but... just let the idea go, baby.
You don't understand anything.
All righty, then.
You're still here?
I am.
I can't help wondering how you found us.
Hard not to follow a trail of bodies.
You must be very proud.
- But you did find us, by the grace of God.
It means we're close to completing our mission.
Slaughtering families and murdering children, that's your mission?
We mourn every life taken.
But it's God's will, to save the souls of so many...
I don't know what fucking God you believe in, but you're a bunch of sick fucks.
They always say that about those who bring disruption.
Who sent you?
Why don't you ask your God?
It sounds like he has all the answers.
I'm not telling you dick.
Suffering brings enlightenment.
Peter, where are you?
It's a big day for you.
I just reviewed the latest results from your last session, and I'm pleased to report that your sed rate indicates a robust monoclonal erythrocytic rebound.
After your last treatment today, your upir retroviral load will be so low, we won't even be able to detect its presence.
You will, in effect, be symptom free, the hunger will be gone.
- What's wrong?
You are at a critical juncture.
If you don't go through with this final treatment, the most virulent and resistant retroviral fragments will rush into the microbial void, multiplying unchecked, rebonding to your DNA, causing them to mutate with unpredictable and potentially catastrophic results.
It will be virtually impossible to eradicate.
All of our gains, all of your suffering will be for naught.
We just need to get you prepped.
No, no, no, those aren't for eating, silly.
Did you do that?
Call me as soon as Mr. Godfrey is out of prep.
- What the hell did you do now?
- I've done many things.
- Could you be more specific?
- Maybe you could tell me why that Barbie doll you whipped up downstairs is pretending to be my daughter!
I replicated Shelley's consciousness and transferred it to a perfect host.
I'm giving her a chance at a life she's never had, a life free from ridicule and persecution.
You have no right to perform your experiments on my children!
Cut the shit, Olivia!
You have the maternal instincts of an arachnid.
Don't pretend you care about Shelley.
How dare you question my feelings for my daughter.
When she was a baby, you couldn't stand to hold her.
When she disappeared, you were relieved.
You couldn't even hide your look of revulsion when she came back.
- That's a vicious lie.
- Roman was right.
The only thing you've ever been a mother to are your own selfish desires.
So... tell me why you're really here.
I'm dying.
- As we discussed...
- You've created life in a laboratory.
Why can't you use the same process to save mine?
Olivia, it's apples and oranges.
Upir DNA isn't compatible with the genetic sequencing.
But I've fed on your failed experiments and they've sustained me.
Wouldn't it stand to reason that your perfected achievement would not only sustain, but rejuvenate me?
You're grasping at straws, Olivia.
Why would you even think this?
What am I supposed to do, give up and die?
Have you been talking to Dr. Zheleznova-Burdukovskaya?
In any case, you have the finest oncologist.
In fact, I was just talking about a new treatment that shows promise:
the extraction of an enzyme found only in the seeds of the Zingiberiflorae family.
It replaces nutrients required by the cancer cells with empty calories.
Junk food, in essence, allowing your body to reabsorb the cancer and process it through your digestive tract.
Just stay the course, and rest in the knowledge that every day brings new miracles.
Thank you for the encouragement.
- I'm here to help.
- Of course you are.
Mother, behold your son.
After today, the filth that you infected me with will be gone.
Time for second-guessing is passed.
He's my blood.
He's your enemy, the cause of your suffering.
Is crackpot cancer treatment fad, totally discredited.
- Why?
- No reason.
This is for you.
Combat pay.
Take the money, and the advice that you gave me.
Get out of this town.
There's nothing good here for anyone.
Thank you.
So, what are you gonna do?
Before I lose my fucking mind.
Ah, you're doing the right thing.
I was trained to believe that monsters were codified in myth to deal with the fears of the subconscious.
Now, I find that I've been sleeping with one for twenty years.
- Take care of yourself, Norman.
That's all I have.
I'll make the necessary preparations.
He'll need to come with me for a period of time.
- What are you gonna do to him?
- It's best you do not know.
You better think this through long and hard, Norman.
Blinding me with dollar signs so you can sneak away and whack your girlfriend?
What are you talking about?
Don't you think I know when someone's trying to get over on me?
So, what, are you following me now?
From your office to the gun store to here.
You decide to go with the hollow points?
You know what she is what she's done.
Even if you manage to kill her, the cops are gonna grab you up.
And don't think for a second that I won't testify against you.
She destroyed my family.
It's a pretty day.
Lying in wait will get you special circumstances and the needle.
You need to go now.
Or what?
You gonna kill me too?
Give me the gun.
You tell that backstabbing Cossack to come find me!
No time for sleep.
We still got miles to go.
Quicksilver.
One of the few things that'll kill a demon like you.
I believe your people refer to it as mercur.
Do you know how many thermometers I had to break to fill this?
It's got its own word in Gypsy for the kind of pain.
I must have been thinking of a different word.
Why are you willing to suffer like this to protect a child who will destroy us all?
Are you so far gone you can't see what you're doing, unleashing hell on earth?
We both want the same thing: stop the killing.
But you hold the key.
Tell me where I'll find the demon.
"A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, while all about it, the darkness drops again
But I know that twenty centuries of stony sleep were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle
Let's give him time to sit with his thoughts.
- The smoking-hot PI.
- Send her in.
What can I do for you, Miss Padilla?
I just stopped Norman Godfrey from murdering his girlfriend.
- That's quite an accusation.
- We both know he has motive.
Means.
And me showing up at the front door just put a kibosh on his opportunity.
Well, he's got a carry permit, hasn't broken any laws.
I can't put him in preventative detention without a court order.
Lean on him.
I was writing my report about our conversation the other day.
Deputy, moment of your time.
Where are you going with this?
Take Miss Padilla into custody.
Trespassing and suspicion of B and E.
Your PI friend came by my office today.
She killed my sister.
I'm sorry.
I came to this town to find the person responsible.
And now I want to put her in the ground.
- Why haven't you?
- She suspects I'm onto her.
She'd see me coming a mile away.
But she trusts you.
You fucker!
You're fucking dead!
Goddamn it.
Answer, motherfucker!
- I'll explain when I see you.
Just get over there right now.
How's my girl?
- What are you reading?
- I have some good news.
That means there's a new you.
One that doesn't have to be afraid anymore.
Thank you.
This means that we're now ready to move into phase three.
It's time for this body to go away now.
I'm ready.
- Does anyone else know?
So, what do you think you're going to do with your new life?
Put on a bikini and learn how to surf.
Then we should move quickly.
I want to see my mother first.
Mom?
I'm still not used to hearing you speak.
I'm not used to moving my lips and having words come out.
Dr. Pryce said it was physiologically impossible.
We all make mistakes, Mother.
I should have done more to help you.
- I want to apologize.
- For what?
Having me for a daughter must have been so hard.
To look at me every day and see something you felt so much guilt and responsibility for.
I understand why you wanted to keep me hidden.
You loved me the best way you could.
Love is... not something I know how to do.
You cried when he came onstage.
He forgot to say "oil can," and just stood there the whole time.
I've seen the way Uncle Norman looks at you.
I'd give anything for someone to look at me like that.
Just once.
I've been so selfish.
You found love.
And in this world, that's a good thing.
Can we start it again?
It'll be better this time, I promise.
Goodbye.
Dr. Pryce asked me to give you something to help with pain during procedure.
I will be back.
May all my enemies turn to ash.
Open the fucking door.
Now!
And if you tell anyone I'm down here, I'll put your head on a goddamn spike.
- Where's my son?
- He's gone.
I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
I don't have to be this person, me.
Olivia, we really do need to talk about your fondness for Merlot.
It's not Merlot, Johann.
I've been guzzling from the cup of life.
Keep your silly experiment.
I choose Norman and happiness for my son and daughter.
I'd rather die from a malignant tumor than continue to live like one.
He's in there.
Can you just tell me that he's gonna be all right?
What I can tell you is when I return him, the vargulf will be cast out.
What I cannot tell you is whether he'll be alive or dead.
But it is certain that if it is not done, more death will follow.
- Who's this?
How many times have you turned against the cycle?
A gift from my father.
He turned on wrong moons.
The look in your eyes is the same as his was.
Your body is deteriorating.
- Get the hell out of here.
- We're trying to help you.
I'm sorry.
The gift you were given has been perverted.
We don't have much time.
Let me help you.
You people have no business here!
- What the fuck is happening?
- Yeah, but what about...
Take his head.
- Where are Miranda and the baby?
It's OK, sweetheart.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
- What are you doing?
- I gotta see if he's OK.
Please don't, they'll kill you!
Please, don't leave me!
Grab the child!
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch.
Praise God.
Are you OK?
He just started bleeding.
I love you so much.
She loves you too.
You're her father.
- Why isn't he changing back?
Stay back.
Peter, it's me.
You're killing him.
Wasn't sure if you were gonna to show.
Let's just do this.
You can walk away and your hands are still clean.
But once we go through this door, there's no turning back.
There must be something we can do, someone we can take him to.
Well, the only other person I know of is dead in the other room.
Decapitation and cremation are the only ways to kill them.
The latter gets rid of the evidence.
So dinner and a movie, tie her to a fucking stake, and set her on fire?
I want you to stab Olivia in the heart.
- But I thought you said that I...
Jesus Christ.
You only get one shot.
Aim under the sternum, and twist upwards and towards the spine.
I'm a doctor, I know where the heart is.
Then show me.
Good thing you're a psychiatrist, not a surgeon.
Aim lower, thrust up.
Again.
Again.
Please forgive me.
Traffic is way backed up all the way along the ten beyond Clearview.
You're probably best to stay away from there altogether.
Construction still holding things up along the 90, so expect a few delays there as well.
What's up, buttercups?
I am starving!
Doctor Spivak says we don't get enough riboflavin in our diet.
And I don't see any dark, leafy greens.
So, how are we all doing today?
- Good.
- Yeah, good.
Oh, it scared the crap out of me.
I haven't had a nightmare like that since I was a little kid.
Guys, it's the 21st century, OK?
My point is, let's not trip, OK?
This'll only be weird if you make it weird.
- What the hell was that?
- No clue.
- She even saw the masks.
- What the fuck is up with the mask?
- It could be shame.
I mean, who wouldn't be ashamed of doing that shit?
- She could be seeing something we're not.
Maybe she could help us find that kid, stop anyone else from getting hurt.
She could get hurt.
We tell her about the dreams, where does it stop?
She's gonna wind up finding out what we are.
Here's what I dreamt about last night.
And this is what came up when I googled the image.
Stained glass windows made by a guy named Frank Bannister.
This is his studio.
You better get going, before it's too late.
You told me to come to you when I had another dream.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- So I've got my hands full looking for the perpetrator, which moves dream chasing further down my to-do list.
There's a family somewhere out there that's about to find themselves in a serious fucking shit storm.
You can do something about it, like keep it from happening, catch the murderers.
It isn't just me.
- Roman dreamt it too.
- Roman Godfrey?
The kid in Toronto who died, Roman dreamt it too.
And the time before that, at the trailer park?
That's when we realized we were both having them.
- I warned you about holding out on me.
- Look, I'm here, aren't I?
- I'm coming with.
- You're staying out of this.
I'm in this, whether I like it or not.
Last thing I need is a citizen psychic with a rap sheet tagging along.
- You gotta listen.
- Do you want to get locked up for interfering with a police investigation?
What are you doing here, Olivia?
You have no business in this building, and you need a security pass to come down here.
What are you doing?
Letting Pryce suck away your power because it terrifies you?
- Goddamn it.
And I told him I wasn't interested in a family therapy session.
Thank God you're all right.
I... missed you.
Did you just...
Yep.
Say something else.
Roman...
Say it again.
Roman... you look tired.
Lost sleep over you.
But it's all gonna get better now.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, darling.
What happened?
Where have you been?
So much to tell you.
We want to hear it all.
- I'm late for work.
- You slept with her again.
- You don't understand.
We're all very cool with each other.
Wait...
I... didn't want anyone to get hurt.
- I was just...
- He couldn't stand up for himself.
You did what you had to do.
- We have to help Jason.
- We will.
You were very brave.
I'm proud of what you did for that little boy.
I know I have not always been demonstrative.
A product of my European upbringing, no doubt.
- This is my daughter.
- I won't watch you prey on her.
- I'm comforting her.
- You're leading her on!
- She's gone.
- Shelley needs a break.
I haven't seen my sister in seven months.
Consider the mental anguish she's been through.
- On account of Olivia.
- Both of you are toxic.
Shelley is malnourished, dehydrated.
She has old gunshot wounds that still haven't healed properly, causing an infection so egregious it's wiped out her immune system.
Which is why her phosphorescence has disappeared.
And then there's the laceration on her back.
What she needs, even more than medical attention, is a period of emotional healing, which means a peaceful environment away from the howling mobs on the street and your endless fucking familial dysfunction.
I can't tell you how disturbing it is you're the one responsible for my sister's peace of mind.
I've been seeing to your needs adequately, haven't I?
I'm not fragile the way she is.
Then we at least have one thing in common.
One more thing.
It's imperative you tell no one, no one, Shelley is here.
I'm not an idiot.
You need to rest, OK?
Pryce says you need to rest.
Look, I'm sorry you have to come back to the same old shit with Olivia.
She's... different.
No, she isn't.
I'm not gonna let her worm her way back in, OK?
It's too much stress on you.
I'll do whatever it takes to get her out of our lives for good.
- Sorry I'm late.
Double homicide, Buffalo, New York.
Only thing she would say of the perpetrator was the woman had "hair of night."
Why are you showing me this?
I ran Olivia's fingerprints through the database, and they came back to this murder.
You got Olivia's fingerprints?
Wait, this happened in 1965, for Chrissakes.
I ran 'em five different times.
I've got a guy at Quantico who eyeballed them himself to preclude computer error.
You would know what goes on in that White Tower, better than anybody.
This, um, this witness, she still around?
- Her address in Buffalo.
- Let's talk to her.
I know who you are.
I understand you might be able to shed some light on some folks having bad accidents that aren't accidental.
You've spoken to Peter.
He told me about a dream you both had, apparently.
Little kids, parents, house with pretty windows, and some bad guys looking to do harm.
- So you didn't have this dream?
- I might have.
But when my head hits the pillow, I, uh, I'm dead to the world.
Wake up, don't remember a thing.
Know anything about a home invasion?
Old lady got a fatal gunshot in her chest.
Two others in critical condition.
Nope.
Assailant's description is strangely similar to the one Sheriff Sworn issued for your sister a while back...
I lost a sister, too.
I know what it's like.
Not something you get over.
Ever.
So, uh this dream Peter told you about give you any leads?
Maybe.
A house in Ohio matches the description.
- Long drive.
- Yep.
You want to watch out for those speed traps.
The five-oh can be real fuck-heads.
But you probably get professional courtesy.
Why don't you come along?
Me being new around here.
- Thanks.
We both have a lot at stake in this town.
I don't need to tell you what it's been through.
There's a Fruit Roll-Up in it for you.
My breakthrough in extrauterine fetal incubation involved an artificial umbilical vein conducting atmospheric oxygen and a fluorocarbon mixture through the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava to maintain lung inflation at amniotic pressures...
You want... to show me something?
Well, I was going to present this at the Ectogenesis Convention in Stockholm next week, but now I've found a cause even greater.
Shelley, this is the new you.
Her cerebral tissue is undifferentiated, so I can map your brain's neuro-network onto it, effectively uploading your consciousness.
Finally you'll enjoy a normal human form.
Quite the pad.
Must be a great place to play house.
Yep, that's my evil master plan, become a housewife and conquer the world one casserole at a time.
I thought you were all about a payday, but I guess you're just one of those girls who needs to be the center of attention, no matter how many guys are involved.
I don't see how any of that concerns you.
As we discussed, I'm not gonna stand by and watch you smash my cousin's heart into a million pieces just so you can get double dipped.
Give me your fucking hands.
The palms of your hands, I need to see them now!
The only dark energy here is you, showing up at the door, talking trash, grabbing me with your cold, clammy hands, and freaking me the fuck out.
If you don't want to believe me, trust your own feelings.
You are nothing if not a drama queen, Roman.
Your cottage?
Technically, everything on these grounds belongs to me.
Technically, I can't be evicted from a hospital, which this place is, after all, unless a medical doctor releases me from treatment.
I'll get Pryce to sign off on your discharge.
Can we just stop this ceaseless pissing contest, please?
Happier.
I'm about to get wheeled in there and have needles shoved into my eyeballs.
You have no idea how much more appealing that is than listening to you prattle on with your filthy lies.
Don't do this to yourself.
Hard to imagine you could fuck up Shelley more than you already have, but you're still at it.
You come to my house when I told you to stay away from my family.
You and your family won't make it without me.
You need me to show the way.
One more treatment after this, I'm human.
I'll be nothing like you.
And when my daughter is old enough, she'll get the treatments too.
Mutilate my granddaughter?
She'll be like me, like JR.
What, you mean weak, indecisive, suicidal?
He chose a bullet in the head over being married to you.
What does that say?
Because of you, I never knew my father.
JR's not your father.
What?
Didn't have it in him.
I know you've always considered him the genius behind Godfrey Industries, because that's the company line, and I didn't want to spoil your fantasy.
But JR's only genius was recognizing it in others.
He met a brilliant medical student one summer in Greenwich Village in a bathhouse, and an even more brilliant woman on the stage in London.
Pryce and I made the company what it is.
None of it would be here without me.
JR couldn't have created any of this, let alone give me proper children.
How does it feel to be human?
What'd you find out?
Oh, I found it, abandoned, windows busted out.
Or you had me chasing ghosts to get me out of town.
Why would...
The reason your man in a hurry for be somewhere is because your man have a wife somewhere.
Talk to you later.
Can barely chew her food.
Hears good, though, on account she grunts when you ask her a question.
But me don't really know how much help she can be.
You have visitors, honey.
Been downhill ever since her last stroke.
We'll make it brief.
Me ever get like that, put a bullet right here, sir.
Hi, Donna.
My name's Dr. Godfrey, and this is Leticia.
These are for you.
We would like to ask you some questions about what you saw the night your parents were murdered.
Do you see the woman in the picture here?
Donna, Donna, it's OK.
Lord Jesus!
We need to go to the sheriff with this.
A ghost story from 50 years ago, scrawled in shit by some mental patient?
You don't seriously believe that implicates Olivia, do you?
Suppose Marie turns up dead.
I'm sorry, but that's a possibility that we need to confront.
There's not one shred of truth.
Truth has nothing to do with a jury trial.
I'd hate to get on your bad side.
No... it's no good.
What?
I shouldn't have come back.
Everyone would be... better.
That's not true.
Do you know how much happiness you've brought?
You are alive, against all odds.
And you are with the people who love you.
I... put everyone in danger.
You all will get in trouble.
I have taken care of everything.
No one will know, not if you don't want them to.
Why not?
The girl is a person, has a soul.
What makes you think that?
We talked.
That's impossible.
Not words.
I know how to talk without words.
Everyone thinks I'm a killer.
This would make me one.
Before you make any final decisions may I show you something?
What do you call a fish with no eyes?
What do you call a fish with no eyes?
A "fsh."
How did you feel when you were being chased?
- That's fear.
That's anger.
Well, I'm sure he's probably in protective custody.
Now let's try it again... with her.
I want you to feel the same emotions again.
This time, the replacement body will be emulating your behavior.
Now, think of something that gives you joy.
Now think of something that makes you frightened.
Nothing.
It's a neuro-muscular response, devoid of any feeling, emotion, or meaning.
Like a machine.
We would be mapping you, Shelley, onto a blank slate.
Now, does this offer any clarification on what you'll be dealing with?
If you like, we could start uploading as early as tomorrow.
Why don't you get some rest while I begin to prep the transfer?
Have you ever seen a dream book before?
- Why?
- They just do.
Because it came to you in a message from beyond?
I heard on the radio that there's gonna be this lottery drawing tonight.
You said something about a boy?
Pitchfork, horns...
And a storm was coming.
This is stupid.
There is nothing stupid about a million-dollar quick-pick.
What's going on?
You don't want to know.
You sent the fucking sheriff after me?
He's gonna help us.
Maybe the kid worships Satan in hell.
That's the team cheer for the Hemlock Diablos, right?
Mascot's a horned devil with a pitchfork.
He's on the fucking Little League team.
That family's in Hemlock Grove.
Does this mean that you are ready for one hand to wash the other?
I spent the afternoon strolling the grounds.
My son is trying to banish me.
Always extreme measures with men.
He has no idea what he's doing.
What about little girl?
What girl?
Some months ago, I'm given unidentified umbilical cord for stem cell harvest after young mother dies.
These... these treatments, when he's done, he plans to subject my granddaughter.
He has only one treatment left.
Only two outcomes possible:
Complications would not surprise Dr. Pryce.
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.
Life is fragile, Mrs. Godfrey.
And your interest in this?
- Exactly.
I've got a good feeling about this lottery.
Yeah, you sure you don't want us to pick you up a ticket?
I thought these two were different.
- Uh, may I?
No one is making any specific allegations here.
We just wanted to furnish your office with information that Mr. Godfrey became aware of that may be relevant to your investigation.
Spoken by someone who's clearly logged more than a few hours working for criminal defense attorneys.
We're sorry for wasting your time.
Have you ever heard of upirs?
There's the church.
There.
What do we say?
Can I help you?
- Help him!
- Was he stung?
- Give him to me!
Darling, where have you been?
Is something wrong?
You have grown up so quickly.
A partnership between my brilliant work and your spirit.
It's time for you to come out into the world.
Are you ready?
My pride, my joy, my dear creation.
You are going to make me the most important scientist since Darwin.
But there's someone to whom I owe a debt, whose life is more important, I suppose, than a watershed of adulation.
And so I must say goodbye.
And so we'll live, and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies."
Stop struggling, fool.
You were struck by a five- step snake.
His venom moves swiftly.
Most die before their fifth step.
Where is my sword?
Taken away.
Punishment for breaking curfew.
You would be a fool to think only one serpent lays in wait.
There is always a deadlier strike to come.
Master Polo.
Save your breath.
The Khan requests that I inquire as to the Latin's health.
Will he survive?
Father will be most pleased.
And, um, the Prince?
Without compassion, what is there to distinguish men from beasts?
What was your student doing beyond the walls?
Sleep escaped me.
I thought a ride would clear my mind.
So close to your throat...
A few inches lower, the venom would have stilled your heart.
Great Khan.
Business forces us to disturb you.
Escort the concubine out.
Leave her to her task.
Tell me, son, what news of the Latin?
Would you rather not hear the news we carry of the Song rebels?
I would have asked first if I had.
The healer promised a full recovery.
What news of the Song?
They request a parley.
To what end, we do not know.
It seems an auspicious opportunity.
It makes little sense with their current standing.
But the parley will give us clarity.
They request you personally, Sire.
Perhaps a ruse to take your life.
They will make do with emissaries.
The thought of a parley pleases me.
Jingim's instincts are correct.
Assemble the War Council.
She has quite a way with the boy, doesn't she?
Where does your sister keep herself now?
Mei Lin was cared for and welcomed in her time here.
What would drive her away?
That was a long time ago, Empress.
Would such a look have escaped your face toward my husband?
I never knew your husband to eat jonquils.
If it suited him, he would have.
And you would have worn a more esteemed look.
Let me pass.
I need to speak with Kokachin.
Delusion is an imperfection that defiles the mind.
I must speak with her, please.
Is it the serpent's sting that has deluded you?
I intend no harm.
You are incapable of harm, Master Marco.
You need to be more vigilant in your protection of Kokachin.
She is in danger.
Concern yourself with the danger you face.
The Blue Princess is secure in my care.
Leave now or suffer my fate.
Have you ever sampled the third sex, Latin?
Four winters ago, I took an arrow in the back fighting the North Hordes.
I tasted blood for two days.
Great Khan bid me come and see him when I was finally able to stand.
And I'm his own flesh and blood.
You were strong and quickly saddled your own steed again.
So brave.
In your absence?
We wait on Father.
Where is he?
Surely tending to his round- eyed pet.
Forgive me, Empress.
Spare the Europa no thought, Jingim.
Do not let your father doubt you the better man.
I am the better man.
The better man does not sit in the dark with his woman and his jealousies.
The better man stands erect and strong and finds a way to tilt the scales in his favor.
It's urgent.
Follow our arrangement and make fast your horse.
Yes, ma'am.
Sidao beheaded our men not weeks ago.
Why call for peace now?
He fears the wrath that comes and seeks to alter course.
His ambition is his arrogance.
But the Chancellor is not the only mind at work within the Walled City.
You see a different landscape, Yusuf?
Have your spies received intelligence from Xiangyang?
The Boy Emperor is but five seasons old.
His coronation day approaches.
Sidao may play the royal, but he's a pretender to the throne.
He desires power, but holds no royal position or blood claim.
There are other ways to secure power, Prince Jingim.
Are we safe to assume Jia Sidao takes such steps presently?
One that must be seized upon with ruthless force.
One that can be molded to serve us.
A grieving widow loyal to the memory of her husband.
The dead Emperor was always a reluctant warrior.
Which hand offers the parley?
Either way, it is better to know what we face... and win the war with this knowledge before we consider the battlefield.
We parley.
See what the table presents us.
Perhaps there will be a dung- stuffed head of a five- year- old.
Then we will have our answer.
Ahmad... you will lead the parley with the Song ambassadors.
Depart at dawn.
Sire... might I recommend sending Prince Jingim... so the parley has some semblance of royal command?
Prince Jingim will oversee the conference.
You honor me with this task.
Heal the battle wounds of Wuchang, Jingim... as a diplomat making peace.
Never volunteer for a stealth mission.
You might as well have a barking dog accompany you.
Great Khan, a rare and exotic gift from the Arabian Peninsula by route of Dunhuang.
Animal smells of shit.
It has been aboard our caravan for weeks, Great Khan.
Rise.
A caravan we humbly take through your kingdom.
A kindness we wish to continue, if your wisdom should allow us.
Prosperous business is always welcome.
We gladly gave tribute, Lord Khan.
You shall be allowed to continue your trade.
My realm is yours.
Do you have any interest in your son?
Then turn, merchant, and behold.
You look like an Oriental.
One must adapt to survive, brother.
And Marco has.
One can adapt without forsaking his heritage... his father's heritage.
My father forsook his son.
- I understand your...
- You understand nothing!
I am sorry I had to leave you, but it is more dangerous on the Silk Road...
Why did you return?
To bank profits, pay tribute, mostly to see my boy.
Is that not enough?
You must trust me when I say all efforts that I make are for our home... our Lord and for you.
I need your help.
Say it and it is done.
This was not an accident.
What requires a sword, Marco?
Someone is in danger.
- Someone?
Marco, listen to me.
I thought he would never go.
One day, he will understand.
Your chest is puffed.
In this place, that's what whores do when they want to get fucked.
The horseman with the shaved head, where is he?
That's half of Cambulac.
This one deals in jewels he could not rightfully own.
That's the other half of Cambulac.
Now, piss off.
You know who I speak of.
Tell me where I can find him.
Did you enter my tea house unarmed?
Answer me!
Tell me where!
The south end.
The shanty by the ironworks.
If you're lying, I will come back.
Please do.
Why do you threaten Kokachin?
What concern is it of yours?
I threatened Kokachin with nothing!
You're making a mistake.
It's on his orders.
Those savages did this, though we did nothing.
Those dogs you live with, they don't know how to treat men of God.
We were smuggling.
There is no point lying to the boy.
Do you know what they do for that?
Why am I here?
We had to store the goods somewhere.
The coin, son.
You left me in this foreign land... and now you have destroyed me.
Do you not see that?
You're a coward.
I finally got what I wanted.
Sidao is not here?
With regret, no.
Surely, the same regret the Great Khan offers for not attending.
I am his son and heir and I speak with full authority.
And I, Prince, speak with authority from the Walled City.
And from whose authority does that flow?
The child, the old woman, or the pretender?
I speak on behalf of all the Song dynasty.
You mean all that remains by a shred of silk down by the Han River.
We take your request for parley with seriousness.
As a gesture of such, the Great Khan releases our prisoners of war from Wuchang to you.
Your gesture is greatly appreciated.
So was yours.
Though returning our prisoners without their bodies was an interesting prelude for peace.
A regrettable circumstance of war and one we wish not to repeat.
Of course.
Provided suitable terms and tribute payments are offered.
You called for this parley in fear.
- Ambassador, this rate is unwarranted.
We will find a suitable figure.
And Minister Ahmad will wait with the convoy by the horses.
The Great Kublai Khan is interested in peace with South China.
Your respect for Chinese ways and culture is known to us, Prince.
We are still new to the ways of your kingdom.
The silk worm is sacred, more valuable than gems and gold, Master Polo.
Its theft is punishable by death.
What is their origin?
They were not procured by us.
A man in our caravan acquired them.
Where is this man now?
He did not survive the journey, Lord Khan.
And I'm quite confident neither shall you.
I've just received word that the great and noble Kublai Khan will not be attending my peace parley.
What parley?
What have you done?
You no longer hold a place in the Royal Court.
Old woman, you have no authority to dictate or declare my place.
My ambassadors were instructed to secure an accord with the Mongols at all costs.
When they return, I will have every authority and you will find yourself a lonely warmonger.
Your currency is the fear of war.
But it is spent and you are nothing without it.
The Song shall not share rice with that bloated Mongolian cur.
The Council will embrace peace if offered.
The people of South China will do their Lord's bidding.
And so will you.
Unchain him.
Leave us.
Tell me of your father.
He...
He is a well- regarded trader.
His shipping contacts have remained loyal through the years.
I ask of character and you tell me of his profession.
Do you have any of your colorful language that speaks to the man or not?
It would be artful color, My Lord.
A mirage.
I grew hearing tales of the Great Genghis.
I knew him only as a small boy, but the man my eyes saw was not big enough.
Genghis of my mind... he was a giant.
Our imaginations outrun us, Sire.
When you made your way to Cambulac and your father left you to me, you had gone no further east, had you?
These silkworms... they are native to the Jiangxi province.
A region you have never visited.
But your father and uncle have since traveled there.
It's the cocoon that gives the silk.
Comes out like sweet milk, then hardens.
Ugly worm turns into an ugly moth, but... leaves such treasure behind.
Then some child somewhere crushes the moth, but... the silk is still mine.
The worm... the silk... the child...
All mine.
You will be spared.
Your father and uncle will be sentenced.
Artful color will not alter their character.
What is their punishment?
It is on this that I dwell.
You've been fighting.
A spy, he tracked me.
Who was it?
You did not need to set the snake.
If the Guard have him...
He knows nothing.
He thought I was trying to hurt you, to steal from you.
And he tried to defend me.
Why would he do that?
I do not know.
We will find cover for our escape within it.
The Song have agreed to cease their raids in the west and pay tribute to you, Father.
Peace without bloodshed is upon us.
But it would be safe to assume the Walled City is caught amidst a power struggle between the Chancellor Jia Sidao and the Empress Dowager.
Let the yellow birds battle over their defeat while we celebrate the well- crafted victory of Prince Jingim.
Such an ugly little creature.
Yet men will kill for it.
Because to them... it is fortune, not legacy, that changes a life.
Come to me.
What is wrong?
I'm simply surprised.
By?
These Chinese, they... require careful attention.
Not something the Great Khan should be troubled with.
Let me find you someone more exotic.
Something that should be remedied with much practice.
You worry without cause, my lovely, favorite wife.
You have a place above all others.
Ceremonially.
Chabi... you have my devotion.
It is time to honor Jingim's Mongol triumph over the Chinese.
I turned your mother's failure to my favor.
Still, mistakes demand correction.
I have a tale to tell you before sleep.
A victorious son!
Ahmad!
Long ago... the consort Yao Niang was the favorite of Emperor Li Yu.
She was a dancer, like you.
Emperor Yu believed that a woman's feet were the very essence of feminine beauty.
This is why he liked Yao Niang.
Her feet were small, delicate, perfect.
Women with such feet became coveted.
Measures had to be taken to keep their feet the perfect size.
Three inches long.
They had to be bound.
That is not how that happened.
I congratulate you, brother, on a fine accord.
You are now proven in battle and politics.
Warrior and diplomat.
And I beg forgiveness if I, at all, overstepped at the parley.
It was your hour, not mine.
Your aggression weakened the Song.
Wolf and crow, Ahmad.
I am just a bookkeeper.
I tally, I account, I serve.
A piece of linen... is wrapped over the four small toes... pulled under the instep and behind the heel.
Come.
Now, this linen... is tightened daily until the toes break, fold under the foot and flatten themselves against the sole.
The heel becomes slender over time.
And finally... the heel shifts forward to the ball of the foot, breaking the arch and forcing it upward.
My Lady.
The Khan is dissatisfied.
I am pained to hear such news.
As well you should be.
Show me.
Empress?
Show me how you move.
I will remedy your flaws.
Do you think you would like to be one of these hallowed women?
Like the beautiful dancer Yao Niang?
Chancellor?
Your mother should have started this years ago.
She causes you this pain.
We are your ambassadors.
My father brought his plight upon himself.
I know this.
It keeps sleep at bay, hmm?
A persistent affliction since I was a boy.
And is it this affliction that sees you roaming at night on horseback?
It is a demon like no other.
One who sleeps wherever he lays his head can never understand the beast.
You, too, My Lord?
The distractions of rule occupy my mind when I should sleep.
You are a thinker, Latin, as am I.
This is good.
Amends must be made for your father's crime.
I understand.
You will decide his fate.
My Lord?
Left to my vice regent, Yusuf, or myself, your father's punishment would be certain.
His thief heart would now be still.
I know the pain this will cause you.
I know compassion.
And you know our laws... our customs.
You will choose your father's punishment.
And then you shall find sleep.
And Gwendolyn Hertz-feld-Mastroantonio!
We are here for the annual Dance of the Lemons, where each of you gets to trade your worst teacher to another school.
Sociopathic child haters who are only teachers because they got tenure after two short years.
That's mean!
You know what you are.
Now, going to Springfield Elementary...
God have mercy.
Seymour, your new teacher is...
Everybody pray!
This is a public school.
I said pray!
Mr. Lassen is here.
So, Mr. Lassen, you began your career at Shelbyville Prep.
That's where I got this scar.
Oh, I see you're left-handed.
So, any dirt on the new teacher?
Is he stingy with the pumpkin stickers?
In this example, I'm Zod.
When he opens the door...
That's kind of scary, but it doesn't make me pee my pants.
I'm Mr. Lassen.
You mean Mr. Less-than?
So, a comedian, are you?
And I've got a whole HBO special's worth on your fat mama!
I-I think I always knew that!
Bart, this guy served two tours in middle school.
Abort prank!
Looks like I've got a prankster on my hands.
You know, son, school code says a student's hair should be of uniform length.
Terrible.
Stop that, all of you.
Teachers' union won the right in their last strike.
I'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.
Marge, please don't say anything.
Well, anyway, Bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend.
What camping trip?
Excuse me, but grass is poking through.
Not you.
So what do you say, Marge?
I want so much to believe you.
And I want you to believe me, too.
Looks like our blackboard has been defaced.
Now we're gonna learn about electricity.
Even I think this is too far.
Quiet, Smellson.
I just need to get to 60%.
Milhouse, I'm gonna get back at Lassen.
Now, The Hobbit taught us that every dragon has a chink in its armor.
It also taught us that New Zealand's beautiful landscapes and attractive tax credits add up to a filmmaker's paradise.
To find out Lassen's weakness, I hid a camera in the teachers' lounge.
You seem lonely and kind of weird.
You left out "single."
Mind if I heat up some goulash?
Let's continue this online.
That's against the terms and conditions.
We've all read the terms and conditions, Milhouse.
Sorry, reservations are a year in advance.
What about Mosquito Cove?
Ooh, how about the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?
Now, give me your lunch money.
Here's Lassen's profile.
What the...?
Tagged as Lassen?
It says these were taken at Blazing Guy.
Helloha.
Do you want to make your home in a self-sustaining city that only exists a few days a year?
One that combines nudity, dust storms, children and all-consuming fires?
Then you, my bro or brah, are dreaming of Blazing Guy.
On the last day, the chosen one, or Ignis, sets fire to the giant wooden Guy in a ritual dating back to 1986.
The Blazing Guy Council of Elders, in conjunction with Duraflame, is very pleased to announce that this year's Ignis is Jack Lassen.
I was trying to even it out.
You're starting to look like your dad.
Gosh, that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up.
Thanks, boy.
♪ A-camping we will go ♪
A world of anarchic free expression.
Cars shaped like cupcakes!
You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds.
We brought Cheerios for you.
Now, you know the wind does kick up here.
Hope you went three feet down with your tent stakes.
Hey man, can I bum a tent?
Calypso Self-Knowledge.
Is that tea... adulterated?
Does that look like something I'd do?
Oh, too bad he's missing this.
There he is.
Get a picture of a restaurant check with no tip, put it online, say it was him.
Compared to the rest of these people, yeah.
So give the Tooth Fairy my forwarding address, 'cause it's pretty loose.
You don't count.
Maybe we should just give up on Lassen.
If Lassen can't light that thing, he'll be humiliated.
What good is an Ignis who can't blaze the guy?
Hideous.
Homie, you promised me an incredible camping trip, and I got one.
Just like I planned.
Get the job done.
Strip him of his nudity.
You.
Maybe we won't have Blazing Guy, but we can still have... blazing boy.
Help me, desert weirdos.
I'll take those.
Beware the butterfly's sting.
Form a human prison and hold him for five days.
No.
So where do you go from here?
A place where my talents will be appreciated.
All right, lights out.
You, too, freak.
You hate him, too?
With every fiber of what's left of my wretched soul.
A partner?
Do you have a moment, sir?
What's your suggestion?
I will let them know.
- Why is that?
What do you think it says on Cornelius Vanderbilt's headstone?
Something in Latin?
If there's a problem, that problem gets solved.
I admire you for that.
Always an eager little boy.
I'm not a boy anymore.
They get in the way.
Haven't I shown you that?
Are you threatening me?
Is that what you think you're doing?
I'm telling you that I'm loyal and ready to be of use.
Commodore Kaestner.
Which, as we know, can be amended.
The chairman of the republican national committee.
In 18 months, Simeon Fess will be standing on a breadline.
Good luck to you, gentlemen.
This way, senator.
I say we cut and run.
Mayflower's entire valuation is tied to repeal.
Highest our shares have been in a decade.
They'll be even higher if we just hold firm.
Just hold steady for 24 hours while I sort this out.
Agreed?
You said you gave them to him.
Well, we wouldn't have had we knew he was a fed.
We need to focus on what's to come.
What's to come is I'm gonna use this to wipe my ass.
Those ledgers detail various streams of revenue for five years running.
This is federal, Al.
Over $2 million in unclaimed income.
Why don't you give us a minute?
- What if he's right, snork?
- He's running the meter, that's all.
These fucking lawyers, they'd turn a parking ticket into a murder charge.
We'll be fine.
There's something much more important I want to talk to you about.
You think Marlene Dietrich's a dyke?
You want Magaddino down from buffalo?
Good.
10 years ago, more maybe, right before prohibition, went down to Atlantic City with A.R.
Now look at us.
Anybody ain't on board, and I mean anybody, they fucking go.
That scumbag Waxey Gordon, Dutch Schultz, that spook in Harlem, Narcisse.
All about moving forward, ain't it?
Mrs. Thompson.
Just what in the bloody hell is going on here?
You're shorting my firm's stock, you and your husband.
We don't discuss orders we place for clients.
Which of your clients is twisting the arm of senator Lloyd?
I have no idea who that is.
Your husband does, and he's trying to screw me.
You'll pardon my candor, but I prefer to do the screwing myself.
I'm sure no one would accuse you otherwise, but my husband has nothing to do with this.
You're the mastermind?
All I know is what I read in the papers.
It won't work.
My partners will stay the course whatever your client told Lloyd to say.
Down nearly three points in the last hour.
I'm no expert, but I'd say your partners are selling in increments.
I'll tell them what you're doing, shore the price back up.
But they're already selling behind your back.
You could sell yourself.
Unload your entire position, then sell short along with my client.
Cash out in one, sell short in another.
Who'd know better than a senator?
Then you and my client buy back, closing the short position simultaneously.
Which is all perfectly legal.
I need to call my broker.
It's complimentary.
Mabel?
I should have picked that up.
What's wrong?
And it happened here.
- What did?
- A mishap.
Are you talking about the baby?
Too soon for that.
Is the baby all right?
It's passed.
Why didn't you send for me?
I've washed.
I'm sorry.
What are you sorry about?
You can't be all right.
I am.
Why are you sorry?
I worked for this.
Everything for this.
I love you.
I should put salt on that.
Please tell me that you're all right.
Ma needs you.
G.E., 261/2!
Mayflower, 153/4.
Westinghouse, seven.
Not yet.
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
We're going to see, aren't we?
Mayflower, 11.
It hasn't found the bottom yet.
71/8. 61/2.
53/4!
Mrs. Thompson.
Now.
Think about the things you want in life, and then picture yourself in a dress.
You've just made some money.
Then let me shake your hand.
You were sweating.
Weren't you?
How would you like to proceed?
He said there were rumors.
I need you to tell me what to do.
Make coffee is what you should do.
Hey, pal.
Lewis and Clark.
Explorers, right?
I need to talk to you.
Not like a vacation where I come back in a couple of weeks.
I will help you.
You'll help me?
Remember, all I did was for you.
To leave you with something better.
And that can't be for nothing.
Dad.
Come here.
The governor's remarks sent the market into turmoil with grain stocks plummeting abruptly, but all recovering by the closing bell.
How did it go?
You haven't been following?
No.
I'm glad to hear it.
Don't you want to know how much?
If you'd like to tell me.
Did you take my advice?
I'm just asking.
Not bad for a day's work.
Dodgy way of making money.
You're awfully good at it.
Will you be renting this?
It's more than I need.
I don't know.
You're not much for outdoors.
Nice to know it's there, though.
What will you do with your money?
Do you have any advice?
And when I got the dime, I thought a quarter.
My circumstances have changed.
There are things I won't do anymore.
You understand that, don't you?
There's what I know, what I suspect, and what I don't think I should ever hear.
Am I supposed to say I'm sorry?
It's not in your nature.
13 stops closer to downtown.
What does that mean?
We danced once, didn't we?
We were just taking a look.
- Do you mind if we...
Three bedrooms, maid's room, study, and, of course, that view.
The Eldorado is designed to be the finest apartment residence in the city.
The very best that life has to offer.
Ask me, he goes tonight.
All over New York running his fucking mouth.
You surprised?
Is it the meeting?
What do you want to do about our friend?
Understood.
No misses, no fuck-ups.
I want it all cleaned up before the meeting.
I said I'll take care of it, Meyer.
Do you know who I am?
Some sort of genie?
What message?
Does it include you?
I'll be there, but I won't be there.
I don't understand.
The only way to knowledge is through experience.
Don't be afraid.
I can't see anything.
Miss?
Found him, ma.
I didn't want to trouble you.
It's no trouble.
Pop, Nucky's here.
Get up.
I said get up.
No welcome for trespassers.
He's not trespassing, pop.
He don't live here.
You hit her again?
Accident.
One too many.
- That amuses you?
- How about now?
I got the gun.
Ethan.
He's your son.
You're scared.
So are you.
Even Susan.
Show 'em who you are.
I'm gonna be a grandfather and you don't want me to know?
Is that what you think of me?
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Are you there?
You called me.
Yesterday, I went for a swim.
It's too cold out there.
I didn't mind.
Went out past the surf line.
Further than I ever dared as a kid.
That's where there isn't any choice.
And?
You never wanted to be here.
I think that's best.
Don't you?
Eli?
At least look at me.
What am I supposed to do with myself?
She won't even open the door.
Maybe you're right, but if you don't try, you'll always regret it.
That's what I think.
How come you got to be the wise one?
Because you needed me to be.
Little brother.
Okay, let's go.
There he is!
Mr. Capone, think you'll beat the charges?
I'm a businessman.
I got 500 men working for me out there.
And this country ain't gonna take care of them if this ship goes down.
Hey, Al, give us that smile, the old chin out.
How about a picture for the final?
Get enough to last, boys.
Thank you all for being here.
Pay your taxes, fellas.
There's no boss.
The five families in New York plus buffalo and Chicago.
Any beefs, wherever you go, new Orleans, Kansas City, St. Louis, they get settled here by us before things get out of hand.
The old way of doing things, it's over.
The mustache petes are in the ground.
Our friends, our partners, the Jews, the Irish, what have you.
If it's good for business, it's good for us.
There's no point in limiting our opportunities.
We generally don't tell the patients that someone's coming to see them.
It creates an expectation that can cause difficulties.
But she's a model girl, so we let her know she would be having a visitor.
She's been preparing all day.
There she is.
Let's just get something straight.
Whatever you want, whatever you think I will do, that won't be possible.
All right?
You were very clever.
And that's more than other people can say.
I'm not someone you should look to for help.
I won't be back.
And if you get yourself out, there'll be money in a trust account.
But that's all.
Don't write me.
Don't try to find me.
Don't look for anything else.
Do we understand each other?
The past is past.
Nothing can change it.
What do you expect of me?
They're called ladybugs.
But how can you tell which one's a lady?
Nice to see old friends?
Dr. Cotton will give you something.
Would you be so kind?
There's still graciousness in the world.
Help you?
Need to pat you down, though.
Can't be too careful.
Don't overstay your welcome.
Mr. Luciano wouldn't like it.
Am I allowed to answer?
It's a private line.
Make it quick.
Hello?
Vic Borden, manager at the ritz.
Jim Neary for alderman!
Ladies and gentlemen, the lord of the deep himself.
Greetings, mortals of the land.
King Neptune welcomes you.
What did she do?
Didn't you think I'd spot you?
What were you thinking?
That it'd be fun to be in a parade.
What happened to your face?
You're not the only one who doesn't like where she's come from.
You said you belong here.
People say lots of things.
You're going to have a family.
What am I supposed to do with you?
Just let me be.
I can't do that.
Then put me in jail.
You mean to anyway.
Mrs. Thompson said you want to be good.
But you don't know how.
- Do you?
- I try.
He wants you up on the porch.
What if I didn't?
I don't see how I'd stop you.
Please?
The woman he robbed, is she okay?
I would have called the sheriff, but I don't want any trouble.
Howdy, Mr. Thompson.
Yeah, howdy.
Thank the nice man and let's go.
Give me the badge.
What?
Give me the badge.
Now go.
I don't understand.
Why?
I don't have faith in you.
But you have faith in Jim Neary?
You have faith in a backslapping bootlicker?
I looked up to you.
I've kept my mouth shut.
You can't just...
You press yourself and I don't like it.
You think you deserve something for trying hard.
I've never liked that one little bit.
Through me and from me, that's all there is.
What are you in the end anyway?
I'm what I need to be.
How's that make you anything at all?
Well, you know, probably not.
What the hell is in your head?
I can't help you.
Go back home.
I don't have one.
Then go find one.
The answer to everything.
No, just the best one I've got.
Nucky.
Thompson.
There is a youth the Commodore wishes to place in service.
What's that got to do with me?
The task is entrusted to the sheriff.
Whitlock: You understand this is an act of charity?
What?
Is something wrong?
Can I go down to the beach?
You want to sail around the world.
Don't you?
She'd go on and on.
Would you like to meet him?
I promise I'll always look after you.
Who are you?
Tommy Darmody.
Amends must be made for your father's crime.
I understand.
Left to my vice regent, Yusuf, or myself, your father's punishment would be certain.
His thief heart would now be still.
I know the pain this would cause you.
I know compassion.
You will choose your father's punishment.
And then you shall find sleep.
Don't kill him!
We must find out who he serves.
How is he?
Poison of the yellow scorpion.
The healers do not know if he will survive the night.
Many fell this evening, Jingim.
Against three assassins?
I will convene the war assembly.
Our Great Khan wavers between this life and the next... and we stand here... violated within our own walls and wonder whether we should avenge.
We do not yet know who violated us.
Is there anyone here aside from my friend Yusuf who cannot...
Our Lord battles the coward's poison.
Prince... we do not know if this is the tip of Sidao's sword.
At this very moment, his army could be descending upon us.
We have received no notice from our outposts of any upcoming armies.
Well, perhaps they have been eliminated.
How did this scum penetrate our defenses?
Walls and guards, dogs and moats.
Prince... the answer to the assassins' identity rests in your question.
They moved underwater and through walls... sensed only by the Khan's horses.
Their tools were climbing hook and shadow.
These demons were trained by the Old Man in the Mountain.
They were Hashshashin.
The Hashshashin... were crushed by my uncle Hülegü long before my birth.
The Old Man and his martyrs are nothing more than phantoms and fables told to frighten children!
If they were not Hashshashin, they were trained in their ways.
They could have been hired by anyone for any reason.
Do you advise I send warriors in search of a myth when our true and very real enemy lies in Xiangyang?
I suggest you open your eyes to the possibility... as your father would.
How many of our guards were slain?
Can we afford not to search out such a potent adversary?
With deference, Prince Jingim... that may not be true.
Who allowed you access to this assembly, Latin?
Jingim.
Speak.
He was clear that those who speak the name of Hashshashin... were offering their heads to these assassins who are very much alive.
What is your point?
Byamba... you will ride there with a company under the banner of the Khan.
If Master Polo is correct... track the assassins and confirm the Song rebels' complicity.
In this answer, the scale of war will be balanced.
Prince Jingim!
And you, Polo, might get sliced into fine white meat in the process.
Prepare your horse.
Tonight... your father and uncle are the least of my concerns.
I make no promises for tomorrow.
An attempt has been made on the Khan's life.
- Is he alive?
Master Polo is among them.
I have taught you to blend with every attack.
Absorb your opponent.
But the Hashshashin are not common warriors.
The Old Man trains them to enter the shadow- self, the demon- self.
That is their art.
How does one absorb such darkness and yet return to the light?
Especially one unsure of his place in the world?
If you seek and find the assassins, you will need to become the vessel.
If you don't go deep enough, they will smell you and kill you.
Go too deep... and you will not return from Eagle's Teaching.
What marks the balance?
Certainty of self.
I do not go for myself, Sifu.
I go for my father.
Ride beneath the skyline.
The Hashshashin do not wish to be found.
They will find you.
Why are you telling me this?
If the Lord Khan dies while you're gone... so does your only advocate.
Take this tragedy for what it is.
This... is what happens when we barter with barbarians.
Cruelty must be met with cruelty.
We must lay waste to their cities, their women and children.
We must drive them back into the savage hole from which they slid.
It is time for war.
The Emperor's army is yours to do with as you please... my Chancellor.
I humbly ask that you give the order to mobilize.
If you do not prepare to strike... worse... prepare to be struck.
The Latin may prove Jia Sidao innocent of the attempt.
It may.
He does so for the sake of his own father's head.
And that is my point.
What would you not do to realize the dreams of your father?
Nothing.
The Khan continues to embrace this boy we know so little about.
The West is not ignorant to the Khan's designs.
Would we not plant rot within the foundation of their house and let it fester and collapse upon itself?
You think he travels to cover transgressions?
I don't know.
Perhaps grief invades my thoughts.
Had you and Hundred Eyes not arrived, the Khan would be dead... as would I. So... my thanks to you.
Jingim as Khan...
- You believe he is not fit?
- I never said that.
Do you?
It's not my place to judge my host.
My mother made me eat them.
She said they kept me healthy.
Of course, she meant they were good for my teeth.
Were you close to her?
I had to be.
Son of a consort is never fully accepted in court.
You?
Were you close to your mother?
She died when I was young.
I was raised by my aunt.
I didn't know my father until three years ago.
Son of an adventurer.
Fathers are destined to disappoint sons, and sons, their fathers.
The Khan has disappointed you?
I'm able to find the difference between the Khan and the man.
Didn't know that was allowed.
What is locked behind the doors of the heart is no one's business but one's own.
So, let's talk about the man, and not the Khan.
Make no mistake... even if we meet under the Blue Sky, I will never open those doors to you.
And I would never knock.
You think by doing this, you can save your father's life?
I avenge the Khan and hope he shows him favor.
The point of all this was to thank you.
So... thank you.
Ride swift.
Sidao must know.
The Mongols will look for spies now, seek out conspirators.
My daughter lives or dies by my decision.
I remain.
Who hired you to kill the Khan?
I am destined for Paradise.
That is all I know and all I will ever claim to know.
You don't want to do that.
Who hired you?
I am destined for Paradise.
That is all I know and all I will ever claim to know.
Very well.
Anything?
He may know nothing.
May know nothing or knows nothing?
May.
Then flay the skin from his bones until you know.
You heard the Prince.
How did you come to name your son?
I did not name Marco.
His mother had that honor.
Why?
I was not present at his birth.
Where were you?
In the world.
So, you abandoned him before he was even born?
I was trying to make a name for my family.
Although I did not know him... everything I have done in my life has been for him.
I wanted the world to know the Polo name.
Do you think that is what he wanted?
Do you think that was what he needed from his father?
Legacy?
Do you know what your son asked of me just before he left?
Even after you had abandoned him, after he could have died for your transgressions, he was still concerned for you.
What a fool.
Never the matter.
Marco will fall and you with him.
We ride below the skyline.
That is not how we attract the buyers we need.
Done.
I do not lie when I say it's the most precious of all gems... and sought by the imperial court.
The flower that guides the way to Paradise.
I wish to speak with the Old Man.
I guess we said something wrong.
Where are you?
I realize now that I had no idea the pressure one is under... turning a son into a man.
It is a great challenge... and... a greater honor.
You are so at peace.
Peace is found in the heart of the faithful.
How can you be so sure he will wake?
My faith is rooted in what is next for him should he not awaken.
I think too much on this life, Mother... to consider what lies beyond.
May I sit?
If your intent is on trade.
Opportunity.
For?
Leaving through that door still standing upright.
And here I was being so gracious.
As am I. I haven't leaned in yet.
Who are you?
There are two answers to that question.
And the second?
The last face you will see before descending into darkness.
Look around you.
Show me.
The Khan of Khans grants the golden tablet to poppy dealers?
No... a bureaucrat in the Secretariat with a liking for hashish.
I do not carry the product you seek.
Then what kind of seller are you?
I am the man in the middle.
We want the Gatekeeper of Paradise.
That man... is far too deadly.
Let us weigh the stakes.
I misread you.
You are a fool.
Continue.
Sidao slaughtered his ambassadors.
My Prince?
The Song ambassadors we parleyed with... the warriors we freed, they were all butchered returning to Xiangyang.
Diplomacy is dead.
Sidao has rejected our truce with steel and blood.
This is a good sign.
Find for me the good in this.
We have clarity of the inevitable.
We know now Xiangyang is divided.
We do not know if Sidao moved against my father.
We do not know if the Song mobilize to attack or to defend.
- We know nothing...
- My Prince!
My brother, yes, we need not march, but... at least marshal our forces.
We must prepare.
In this, you must not fail.
Gather your generals.
Speak to them as warriors and they will follow you past the gates of death.
As they followed me at Wuchang?
The army respects you.
You attacked at Wuchang against greater numbers.
And I failed.
But only while daring greatly.
You advanced on a larger army as Genghis would.
Soldiers understand losing is part of the journey... so long as their leader does not believe it the destination.
Your father understands this.
He did not act as if he did.
Would you have him savor defeat?
No... but to speak as you do... once.
He feels as I do... and he would say it now, had he voice.
Lend him your voice.
Who is the Old Man in the Mountain?
You certainly are not fond of your throat, are you?
You learn well, Europa.
Which way?
To Eagle's Teaching?
One can only enter through Paradise.
A secret order formed at the time of the First Crusade.
The Old Man has always lived among them... granting access to Paradise.
Is he a magic man?
He is a holy man.
I think you trade in black market fables.
That's what I think.
You have a much more genteel personality than your friend.
I will not.
Byamba, do you see?
It is not the sun.
Marvelous description.
Are they watching us now?
They have been watching you since before we exchanged names.
You are the Old Man.
Some call me by that name, yes... but I've lived more lives than any man under the sun... and will live many more beyond this day.
And this... is a place of hidden knowledge?
This is a place of freedom... where no one questions who you are, where you come from, what tongue you speak.
You are welcome as you are, son.
I can return you to Paradise if you wish.
What have you done with our men?
It is their choice to stay or leave.
Some prefer to stay.
So, tell me, Marco Polo... why did you come?
To discover or to destroy?
Give me my men and I will give you the answer.
Discovery.
I came to learn who hired your assassins.
Offer me this knowledge... and you will gain favor with the most powerful man on earth.
The Great Khan lives, then.
And your disciples do not.
Kill us... and the Khan will finish what his ancestors began.
He must find us first.
If I could find you... the Mongols will find you.
They will rain fire, black out the sun.
You will have no peace, no sanctuary... and my Great Khan will prove you mortal.
You are precisely the kind of young man I welcome here.
Clever... spirited... and deserving of Paradise, however you define it.
We do not deal in name and faces... only in coin and anonymity.
And how much coin did the Song Chancellor give you?
The hand that dropped the purse lives far closer to home, son.
Safe journey, Marco Polo.
How many more days and nights will this continue?
Nothing but hope... that he might give me anything to use to avoid your war.
This is not my war.
Yet you fight for it so rabidly.
The rebels have not once set foot outside Xiangyang... for any purpose but trade and travel.
They stage raids and they attack my collectors as they ride the realm.
The price of doing business in a treacherous world.
Their army hides behind walls for fear of extermination, a wall that has defied and denied us for 70 years.
Our men will die for no reason... save the ego of the man ordering the breach.
Ego... not armies, destroys empires.
Our Khan is chased to the wall by the ghost of Genghis.
Our Khan still breathes.
The man will soon join his brothers... and if you have your way, Ahmad... so shall we all.
Word from my sister.
Someone has attempted to kill the barbarian king.
We're not alone in our loathing of the Khan.
The devil sleeps soundly tonight.
It displeases me.
Someone has foolishly stepped upon my path... endeavoring to forge a tributary and force me down it.
The Khan will awaken.
The Mongol horde will descend upon my wall... and my blade... will find its destiny in the barbarian's heart.
You are the only one I might speak freely to... the only one I can trust.
It makes me happy to know I have this with you.
This is my father's private quarters.
The traitor is someone in his service... someone he trusts.
I may know the hand that made these marks.
Whose hand?
Someone who has passed on.
You have time before the snows fall.
You were killed by the Hashshashin.
You would let me go?
Upon our return, your host may be gone and you would be friendless.
Are we not now friends, Byamba?
I cannot save you in Cambulac.
Would you defy the Khan?
No... but this is my home... and if someone were keeping me from it, I would kill to return.
Jingim!
Our father wakes.
Welcome news, brother.
I will join him.
My head is weak.
It will strengthen.
Perhaps it's best if it did not.
My son seems to have that side well under control.
You could easily have rushed into war.
Few would have questioned the move.
Your control guided you.
I never felt in control, Sire.
Curse of the Khanate.
The kingdom must know that I'm alive and well before we march into war.
Get me to my throne.
It has details of your inner chamber few would know, Lord Khan.
I spend my Khanate embracing enemy cultures.
Treachery grows well in the fertile soil of contempt I've tilled.
Who else knows of this map?
No one... but Byamba, myself, and its creator.
Circle must remain small.
What of Jingim?
I do not wish to burden him as of yet.
You say you recognize the scratch?
I wish to confirm this belief before I tarnish his name any further.
I trust you both to do so.
Follow the map, where it leads, under my aegis.
Bring answers back to your Khan.
Hold, Latin.
I was one of many... and it pleases me greatly to return and find you well.
No, Lord Kublai.
Is pardon punishment?
I wished... you would spare them.
Why would I do that?
My Lady, they are upon us.
Lady Kokachin.
Is it not better than death?
No, Nergüi... to live under the yoke of a Khan is not better than the Eternal Blue.
Lady Kokachin!
Do we have to attend?
Your absence would be noted.
Khutulun... that wrestling whore from the west.
Please expel any of your contempt within the confines of these walls, Princess.
You will conduct yourself as you always do... with graciousness.
You may have more in common than you imagine.
That's doubtful.
You lost another trinket.
A poor decision to wear it on my whip hand.
Yes, a poor decision.
You take great risk to avoid a greater danger, I understand.
In celebration of this New Year... perhaps you would allow me to eliminate this danger... with my sword.
Father.
Your uncle knows, too... but will not confess it.
The Khan will never allow you back into the Imperial City.
We will meet again.
We go to the Silk Road to die.
No lodging, no fresh horses, no vittles.
We should go.
The Great Khan will be expecting an answer before the White Moon.
Polo!
Did you come to greet me?
I'm touched.
Did you miss Khutulun?
I'm to present myself to the Great Khan.
Come, witness the pomp.
Good.
He and your brother learned as much on their trek as Yusuf did flaying the skin off the assassin's bones.
The former.
I love that girl.
- Are you aggrieved, Jingim?
- I am fine, Mother.
Then be fine.
Spirits high for our Khan and our kingdom.
Let us find resolution before the White Moon.
I come here, Khagan... as emissary for my father, Kaidu of Karakorum.
Sire... we were pained to hear of the cowardly assault on the Great Khan's person.
It is my father's request and my wish... that I remain with my horsemen in Cambulac as protector of the Great Khan.
Kaidu seeks to ensure your safety.
I'm your servant.
I have ample protection.
But I welcome your presence.
I accept your horse, your sword, your spirit.
You are home.
We're deeply honored, my child.
I invite you to rest... then join me and the ladies of the court.
I require no rest, Lady Chabi.
Lead and I will follow.
We tour Cambulac in preparation for the Festival of the White Moon.
You will accompany us.
I am... deeply honored.
A word with you, Blue Princess.
Why did you not listen to me?
Why did you not run from this place?
I want to know why you ride the grasslands alone at night.
I want to know who you leave the stones for and why.
That is none of your concern.
I cannot protect you if you do not talk to me.
I did not know it was you.
I fear discovery.
Of what?
Tulga... the man you confronted.
He is a survivor of the Bayaut.
- That is why he allows my rides.
And abdicates his duty.
I forbid him from handling the gems.
I will not compromise my friend.
I will carry the gems from now on.
You wish not to compromise your friend?
Imagine what would happen to him should you go missing now.
Good New Year to you, brother.
I worry when you call me "brother" instead of "bastard."
It precedes a request.
I await your command, Jingim Khan.
- None... or none you will speak of?
None.
We're talking about my father.
You want to know about Eagle's Teaching, ask Father, brother.
And I will... with my life.
What did Jingim want of you?
Amends made before the White Moon.
There are no answers here, Byamba, only pain.
The most important answer may lie within.
We must confirm it to understand our next steps.
Stay if you wish.
Can I see your mother?
White devil.
Forty days is the mourning period.
Too late.
I was away at war.
That was some time ago, Master Polo.
Find a better reason for your absence.
I have none.
Goland, I'm sorry for what happened to Sanga.
More sorry for what I'm about to ask.
Did Sanga ever travel to Kochkor?
Do you suspect a dead man of another crime?
You wish to resurrect him, Christian?
Crucify him once more?
He stole and he was punished for it.
I did not sentence him... and I did not kill him, Goland.
And my husband did not send himself to Kochkor.
But he did go?
He collected taxes.
Every second fortnight, he rode.
My husband was an honorable man.
Question the man who sent Sanga to Kochkor before you question that.
Leave us... please.
We distribute 100,000 loaves of bread every month... goat milk and yak meat when the Great Khan's herds are fat.
The people are fortunate for your grace, My Lady.
We take care of our wards... and they revere the Khan as their father.
Today, they honor us by working tirelessly to prepare for the White Moon festivities.
Something wrong, Blue Princess?
I was merely observing the peasants' devotion, their love for their royal benefactress.
Do you question their devotion and their love?
I do not.
Stop.
Does Lady Kokachin wish to speak on the topic of the common people?
I apologize, Empress, for speaking when not bid to do so.
Do so... now.
The Empress' perception of the city is tempered.
The people love the Khan because he eases their pains, fills their wants... but the cause of those pains and wants is never permanently stamped out.
That can breed resentment.
My relations with our people, Lady Chabi, were somewhat more direct.
Is that so?
I mean no offense... but the Great Khan should know the minds of his people before he walks among them tomorrow.
The Khagan has my sword and my shield.
I will meet minds with metal, My Lady.
The Great Khan is secure.
Is the pain bad today, child?
The child suffers, Chancellor.
As do we all... but seeming cruelty can bring beauty.
Pain purifies and leads to peace.
These are lessons my sister taught me when I was a boy.
The girl is too old for binding.
We would have started at an earlier age were that her father's want.
The Emperor's gone.
'Tis a powerful man who injures little children.
I miss my mother.
Are you mad?
Why are you here?
I am to stay until this mission is complete.
Safe to the touch, but if ingested, it's enough to fell a horse.
This message says nothing of my daughter.
Speak.
He bound her.
What he asks of me is impossible.
What else did you find in Eagle's Teaching... besides impure gold?
We found evidence that Sanga hired the Hashshashin.
We thought you might offer guidance.
Because he worked for me?
Sanga worked for many.
From Cambulac to... yes, Kochkor.
The Hashshashin deal in more than death... black market trade, silk, coin, salt... and currencies I do not countenance.
If Sanga were running black market goods throughout the realm, he'd need agents... soldiers, horsemen... imperial guard.
You have seen my soldiers.
They toil before the abacus.
I certainly do not command the imperial guard.
That's Vice Regent Yusuf's domain.
I simply state fact.
Thank you, Ahmad.
Why did you finally report Sanga?
You reported his transgressions to me.
Had I not, it would have been you or I unjustly trampled in the dirt.
How do preparations for the boy's coronation fare?
I trust seating arrangements are managed?
No awkward pairings?
Lord Li cannot tolerate Prelate Chan.
Leave us, please... everyone.
The Dynastic Council has chosen to dismiss you, Sidao.
We appreciate your service to the Emperor... but it is time for you to step down.
Have you anything to say?
You have no authority.
You are an old woman with a dead husband and no power.
You have nothing.
I have a champion.
Do you know Fang Zhen of the Red Lotus Society?
By reputation.
A peasant farmer.
He is not me.
I shepherded this city, this empire through a time of tumult... and that time has not passed.
The Mongols will return.
If they return, they will settle terms of peace... and negotiate those terms with him.
Chancellor.
Take your pets and your porcelain, Sidao... and return to the rice paddies.
It is poor form to disturb a man at prayer.
We are here on the orders of the Khan, Vice Regent... not your God.
A serious matter.
Do you remember Sanga, the collector of taxes?
He was executed on your orders.
My Khan favors you, Marco... thus spared your father and uncle.
That was his choice, not mine.
But the Khan had no hand in Sanga's end.
Respectfully, death was your decree.
You could have branded his palm, severed his hand, taken an eye.
I could do these things to you for challenging the dictates of the Vice Regent.
And you suspect Sanga was my proxy?
In the absence of the Khan, the Vice Regent would control Cambulac.
This is true until the Kurultai elected the next Khan of Khans.
What motive have I, then?
He does, Master Marco.
I am trusted... because I lack ambition.
I have no blood claim to the throne, so there is nothing to which I may ascend.
I am a servant who has but one function.
Which is?
I speak truth.
It is this respect I show my Khan.
My days are driven by this alone.
"How do I best serve Kublai and his kingdom?"
Yet here we are.
Yet here we are.
Think on that as you take your leave.
Is my father safe?
Whatever they found in Kochkor was of no consequence.
He doesn't want to burden you with trivialities.
He doesn't trust me with the truth.
And what would you do with it, Jingim?
What would you do if you had a target for your rage?
The Great Khan knows this.
If there is some truth to hold from you, he does so because he knows your heart.
Let your father protect you.
Let me, your brother, protect you... until we find a true target.
Untrue by an inch.
Untrue by an inch, untrue by a mile.
When you first arrived, you had too little yin, too much yang.
Not so simple.
Do not strive for the center.
The Khan expects an answer.
What answer to give?
The cripple, Yusuf, is beyond reproach.
Yusuf hides behind his words.
Is that what you'll report?
Untrue by an inch... untrue by a mile.
I have no story to tell, Sire.
I believe my friend, Sanga, traveled to Kochkor... but I do not know on whose command... if anyone's.
What are your suspicions?
I must say nothing... for fear that I may condemn an innocent.
Many do, Latin.
But my children have been spared sight of me far too long.
Take your leave.
Your children want you alive, Sire.
Do you still suspect him?
A weaker man would surrender a name to deflect suspicion from himself.
As would a man burdened with guilt.
I believe him to be neither.
The boy has changed greatly since coming to us.
You suspect the Latin's father?
Did he abandon his son to serve his purse... or his pope?
So, what course of action tomorrow?
We have detained and questioned your guards and staff.
I believe them innocent.
There would be few left living if I heed that counsel.
Should I trust you, Yusuf?
We will play another time.
Where's your European playmate?
He's an innocent in this world, isn't he?
And you and I are not?
No... we are warriors.
I fear our world strips him of what innocence still remains.
Then we do him a favor.
The world is not kind to the weak and the guileless.
Would you like to wrestle me?
There are no witnesses, save Tengri.
Do you think you can beat me?
I think you wish me to.
Not today.
Are you afraid?
I simply hear the blade's song right now.
Where you go?
Come.
If it pleases the Khan.
It does not please the Queen.
Pitiable event on this blessed day of Tsagaan Sar.
It seems life has left her too soon.
The Khan's consorts must not cry.
It clouds the eyes and ruddles the complexion.
Death is life.
Now is not the time for tears.
Will you return to your village, Chancellor?
I have been an admirer of yours... from afar... from the battlefield.
I've long admired you as well.
I tire of warfare.
Before or after Empress Dowager offered you my title?
Yes... the warrior who rejects war.
Is it time?
It is, Father... but I did not advise your attendance.
What can be done has been done, Jingim.
You worry like your mother.
Vice Regent Yusuf himself concurs with me.
Yusuf is worse than your mother.
We do not yet know who conspired against Your Greatness.
Rumor breeds fear.
My people do not know if blood courses through my veins... or if my body rests with Genghis in Burkhan Khaldun.
I must show them their Khan.
You are concerned you are seen as weak.
I cannot afford to bolster these perceptions.
There is no question, Father.
You slayed Ariq single- handedly.
He saw me as weak.
You will be opposed at the Kurultai when the time comes.
The throne is mine and I will ascend to it.
There is nothing I desire more than this.
But you fear I will fail.
You must prove yourself to the Khanate.
I fulfill my duty.
Am I such a burden?
You're my son.
You lie.
I know who you are.
No more.
If I found you, someone else will find you.
It will be your undoing and hers.
You love her.
We are to be together.
But you will live.
All bow down and worship at once your Lord.
God save and keep our Lord long with joy and gladness.
Long live the Khan of Khans!
Urla.
No line up for water on the night of the White Moon.
I'm sorry for what happened to your father.
As you said, you did not sentence him... and if he was a thief, he was deserving of punishment.
Sanga was a good man.
What do you think he did?
What was it Ahmad sent him to do?
I cannot answer that.
Move on.
Help your family to find a future without him.
The bracelet is delivered.
I am most grateful.
I will repay your gesture in the future.
How is it that a peasant weds a princess?
No royal marries beneath their station.
Then Tulga is delusional?
I could not be with Tulga, Master Marco, any more than I could be with you.
You avoid a direct answer to my question, Blue Princess.
Silence is no shield, Kokachin.
He is not.
Then there are nuptials to be arranged.
Is the Khan aware?
You lack humor, Latin.
I intend none.
I am deceived.
It is time for Jingim to take a new wife, I think.
A more fertile bitch, I hope.
The rest are barren as my Gobi.
I trust you have someone in mind?
Stop!
I do always get what I want, and what I want to do with this company is strip it down, flip it over, and then--
We are.
When I told you that our relationship was now purely professional, I was serious.
What's not purely professional about lunch?
Unless you mean the sex that'll be following lunch.
Phillip, your son, you lost him, and that's what this company is to you now, your family.
I lost both my parents when I was 11 years old, so I know a little something about needing family.
Since when does the S.E.C. go around intimidating law firms by going after their clients?
They don't, but they will when Eric Woodall starts there next week.
What were you working on?
Okay, but I can't be responsible for anything that I say.
Well, okay, in that case, is Logan going after another board member?
Did you love him?
Who ended it?
- Does that matter?
I ended it.
Now, do you have any other burning questions, or can I go to sleep, please?
Were you a mean girl?
Sweet dreams.
We were just talking about you.
Not enough.
He found the master tapes for his father's solo album.
He's working on buying them.
He's been trying to find them ever since he lost his father.
Oh, I see why you're telling me this.
You're trying to humanize Harvey, because you're afraid of what this fight is gonna do to us.
I'm afraid because of what it's already doing to you.
So am I, and that's why I'm giving him my best.
Thanks for the coffee.
You're in late.
I was up late.
About?
And that means that I'm gonna have to do some calculated things, and I needed to know that you're okay with that.
Why wouldn't I be?
You know why.
Logan, you don't have to come and have these little check-in talks with me.
I am a big girl, and I know how these things work.
So just do what you have to do, and stop worrying about me.
Harvey, what the hell's going on?
At the moment, I'm 18 minutes away from owning Steve McQueen's Shelby Cobra.
Right now, we're getting our ass kicked.
Well, what scorecard are you looking at, because we just got them to give up half their war chest just to stay in the fight.
Well, it doesn't work that way.
The only difference I see is that this deal is against your surrogate son.
So are you willing to do this or not?
Louis, we talked about this.
It's just so weird to see him in my old office, you know?
You and me, we got off on the wrong foot.
Words were said, hurtful caricatures were drawn, and I did some bad things too.
Water under the bridge, Louis.
Well, no, not to me.
See, um, I once was told that actions have consequences, and I want to turn things around by inviting you... to the American Ballet Company's production of Giselle.
I am always, always in the black, and I don't mean that in a racial sense.
Well, now that you mention it, I could really use some advice.
I just pulled Adam Grieves as opposing counsel.
And long story short, he hates me, and I could really use Jessica's help to run some interference, but I'm the new guy, it's only my second case, and I don't know what to do.
Okay, Harvey, you didn't bring me here to make me choke down these brussels sprouts.
No, I didn't, but you are going to have to choke down something else.
And why on earth would I do that?
Because if you don't, I have a feeling that every Pearson Specter client that you currently do business with, suddenly gonna move their accounts to Chase.
That doesn't give you the right to threaten me.
You son of a bitch.
That he is.
Because this is where Harvey brings bankers to strong-arm them into doing some bullshit.
I'm Walter Gillis' partner, and if he cuts off our funding at any point in the next two months following this lunch, then the next time you're talking about these brussels sprouts will be in front of a grand jury.
Oh, Vernon, don't take it personally.
He did the same thing to the guy from Leeds at the exact same table seven months ago.
Louis, I got your memo, and if you want to get an antique diving bell for your new office, it's on your dime.
Okay, that's bullshit, but whatever.
I'm here about Jeff Malone.
Something's not right.
I thought you just said you worked it out.
Louis, I'm glad you two are going to be walking to school together from now on, but I hired Jeff Malone to handle the S.E.C., not to get me to handle them for him.
Louis-- if you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
I just had a very interesting chat with Louis Litt.
I did not, but I do know you fed him some bullshit.
Of course not, because you and Adam Grieves play basketball every Wednesday.
What happens on the court, Jessica, stays on the court.
And I thought I was clear about boundaries.
Well, listen, if that's really how you feel, why don't you just tell Louis that you want to bow out because you don't trust yourself around me?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
See you tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I'm saying you hire a private investigator to find every skeleton in his closet.
Who's full of shit now?
This has nothing to do with Rachel.
You got there pretty damn fast.
Hey, I asked you to put Mike Ross down with one punch.
You said you would, and you didn't.
So either do what I'm asking, or I'll do it myself.
What's the difference if you hire somebody to look into Mike or Logan does?
- Yeah, I do.
- No one's ever found it before.
Because you were hiding it from people who weren't looking for it, not from people who are.
What do you want from me, Donna?
I want you to get Mike to give up.
Well, I'm not gonna do that, because I know he's not gonna give up.
This is Mike we're talking about.
Well, the least you can do is warn him.
That's not how it works.
We just need to come up with a legitimate reason why Brooks made that trade.
There is no legitimate reason.
You are taking to defense like a fish to water.
Well, you didn't bring me in here just for my genetically superior bone structure, did you?
Mm, no, that's what I brought him in for.
Good, because Jessica and I were just having a little difference of opinion about what to do next.
Yes, and I'm sure Louis, the man that I hired, the man who owes his very career to me, will see things my way.
Well, I don't want to step on anyone's toes.
No, Louis, you're not stepping on anyone's toes here, and to be fair, I think you're an amazing attorney who doesn't owe anyone anything.
Ooh, do you work out?
Oh, I-I try to stay fit.
Jessica, what debate team trick?
Look, Jessica, you can make assumptions about how this farm boy's gonna come down on this all you want to, but I think we all pretty much know he's playing on my team.
Because now I've this farm boy all to myself, Jess.
Just you and me, cowboy.
Donna, his arguments are loaded with double meaning.
Who invokes the penal code in an S.E.C. case?
He said "penal"?
Okay, Louis, what exactly do you want from me?
Donna, I don't think you understand the power of my sexuality.
I have a file?
That information is classified.
If you'd be more comfortable, I have a couple rocks you could crawl out from under.
Most people would go with some tall weeds I could hide behind.
If you knew what this company meant to me, you wouldn't be trying to steal it.
Walter, I know how your son died.
Get the hell out of my office.
Not before I tell you that Mike Ross was a drug dealer.
Bullshit he was, and I'm calling security, and if you're not gone by the time they get here, their job's going to be getting me off you.
Ask him if he ever refused to take a drug test.
And ask him if on the very day he came to me looking for a job he had a briefcase filled with marijuana.
Well, you are nothing but a piece of shit.
But that doesn't make what I'm telling you any less true.
Walter, what are you doing here?
I'm having second thoughts.
About the takeover.
Have you ever been involved in a drug deal?
Have you ever been involved in a drug deal?
What did Harvey tell you?
Looks like he told me the truth.
The truth is that Harvey can't beat us, so he's trying to divide us, and he's using your son to do it.
Just like you used his memory to make you my partner.
To save your life's work.
Another lie from another liar.
You two deserve each other.
We're done.
Louis thinks Malone is in love with him.
Your secret's safe.
And you're welcome.
Hey, Louis, do you have a minute?
Well, it's about all I have, 'cause I'm super, super busy.
Yeah, well, listen, I just wanted to check in and see if you're ready to pull an all-nighter.
Tonight, unless you want to go right now and just pound it out all at once.
Too clear, man, too clear.
But I play a different instrument, so...
Right.
Are you gonna be okay?
To be honest, I'm feeling a little raw right now.
I'm sorry.
Maybe it's best if you just told Jessica that she needs to step back in.
Get up.
You here to fight me?
I'm sorry, were you expecting me to give you a call?
No, I was expecting you to be a human being.
And what does that make you for threatening to bring criminal charges in that restaurant?
You deserved criminal charges for what you were doing in that restaurant.
You didn't have a problem when we did it seven months ago to the guy from Leeds.
Seven months ago, you weren't lying to somebody about me.
I didn't lie, and seven months ago, you were goddamn here.
Without me?
If I stayed here, you know what would have been hanging over my head for the rest of my life.
Which is why I told you to move somewhere nobody ever knew you.
But you stayed here, so that thing is still over your goddamn head, and I stopped it.
And you're the one who lost something today.
What are you talking about?
Those tapes have nothing to do with this deal.
They do now.
I've been meeting him for coffee just because I wanted to make sure that everything was okay between the two of you, and I never, ever thought that he would do something like this.
I'm so, so sorry.
It's not your fault, Donna.
The second I believe they do, I'm done.
Ugh, perfect timing.
The part where you come off looking like a rich, vindictive douche bag.
That's not your call to make.
Based on your years of experience in takeovers?
Here's something they didn't teach you in snowboarding school or wherever the hell you went before you decided to be a grown-up.
You know, you told me that Mike Ross wasn't a threat, and then he handcuffed us with a T.R.O.
You said that you'd take him down with one blow, and then he got back up.
So here's something that I did learn in snowboarding school.
When someone talks shit, I demand proof.
Where are you going?
I feel guilty that I told him, but what he did, that's on you.
He came in here wanting an explanation for why you did what you did, and you threw gas on the fire.
I gave him an explanation.
Yeah, you told him he was nothing.
It doesn't matter what I said to him.
I saved him.
Harvey, you said before if it had been anybody other than Mike, you would have done what Logan wanted without blinking an eye.
Well, if anybody other than Mike had walked in here the way he did, you would have shown him the tiniest bit of compassion.
He bought those tapes before he ever walked in here.
Those tapes were not the first thing that he told you about, but he made damn sure they were the last.
So you just flagged me down to call me an asshole?
No, I flagged you down to tell you that he's not gonna listen to you, but he might listen to somebody else.
Oh, that's too bad.
Feel like Sushi?
Jeff, you can play all the games that you want, but an all-night review of the evidence is a waste of my time.
Listen, if you don't want to be here, that's fine.
But I am gonna do this by myself, because I don't have associates do my work.
And why is that?
Do you really want to know why?
Dalton Foster was a con man who somehow convinced terminally ill people to sign over their insurance policies.
Anyway, he was my first big case, so I decided that I would get some help going through the evidence, just like this.
Six months later, he pulled the exact same scam.
Only this time, the problem was, one of his dying clients had a miraculous recovery.
Did I take advantage of Louis?
Absolutely.
I may play games to get us together, but I never play games with a case.
Because you usually just tell me what to do.
Remember when you said if I want you to deliver a message to Mike, I should come to you directly?
That's why you went to Gillis.
You had no choice.
That's not the way Mike saw it.
You know, you could have come to me before you did that.
I'm coming to you now.
Say it took twice as long as it did.
Okay, I take it back.
I now know about his bronchitis, his problems with his dry cleaner, but absolutely no explanation whatsoever about why he cashed out.
The Ponzi fund was made up of small-cap stocks.
That's a legit reason for him to have cashed out.
Exactly what we need to get the charges dropped.
And exactly the kind of call a junior attorney might have missed.
What is it?
I have responsibilities that you just don't want to understand.
No, I don't.
I am the only woman partner at this level in the city.
If word got out that I hired a partner that I was in a relationship with--
What, you'd be disbarred?
You think this is a joke.
Oh, what the hell is that supposed to mean?
I'm sorry.
Hey, so I know we said we're not supposed to talk about the deal--
Why did you lie to me?
What are you talking about?
When I asked you about you and Logan, you said that you ended it.
According to this, you swore it was him.
This is my deposition from his divorce.
You still haven't answered the question.
Mike, I told you the truth.
Logan was trying to patch things up with his wife, and he asked me to back his story, so I did.
You lied for him.
I told you that I loved him.
Yeah, but you didn't tell me that.
And I've been sitting here all night wondering why you wouldn't...
Why wouldn't you tell me that?
I'm gonna tell you now.
We had an affair.
You are.
I love you.
I love you too.
Where are they?
What are you talking about?
I don't even know that girl, okay?
And you think that if I was having an affair that I would have it with a paralegal from my father's firm?
I understand that you--
And you stood right here and told me that you didn't love your wife.
And then three months later, you asked me to lie for you, so you could get her back.
You remember Adam Grieves?
He asked me to tell you that you guys are still on for ball on Wednesday.
You're not trying to get into my pants.
You're trying to get into Jessica's.
You thought you could move your way up the ladder, and you used my friendship to cozy up to her.
Why did you lie to me to get me off this case?
Tell me what I'm missing here, Jeff.
That's what I thought.
I will not make that mistake again.
I'm here to see Mike Ross.
I have a meeting.
I came to apologize.
I don't want to win that way.
That sounds like something your publicist would tell Forbes.
Why don't you tell me why you're really here?
You want the truth?
Okay, look, I get it.
But you need to hear this.
I started this company with no one to trust but myself.
I just bought another 2% of your stock, which means I'm saving your company with or without you.
Jeff, it's late.
It's not about us.
It's time for you to start earning your money.
You get me a present?
It's my dad's tapes.
He said they're yours.
You got him to back down.
No, but I got Logan to back off.
You know, you could have come to me first.
Previously on "How to get away with Murder"...
A woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta House.
- We represent Mary Walker.
Say it.
Lila was six weeks pregnant.
Judging by the chip on his shoulder, I'm guessing it'll fit.
Mr. Darcy.
Then why can't you tell me?
He has a wife.
Lila was six weeks pregnant.
You lied when you said you didn't sleep with her.
Was Lila?
Should've worn a condom. sometimes, we're not responsible for our own actions, because sometimes, we behave not like thinking, thoughtful human beings, but as animals.
Such is the case of Gretchen Thomas, a successful real-estate agent, wife, mother.
Like many a high-powered professional, stress and anxiety are part of her daily routine, so she takes a prescription sleeping pill before bed.
She begins to clean up the mess.
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to get to your office.
It's Mia's 13th birthday this weekend, and planning has been crazy.
Who would've thought that it'd be so difficult to find a deejay?
It's just that you have come so highly recommended from my friend Karen's...
You're on trial for first-degree murder.
Put the phone down so we can prep for your testimony.
I've changed my mind.
I don't want to take the stand.
Honey, this isn't just your decision.
You have a family who needs you, children who need you.
If she wants to go to jail, dad, let her.
Your mother is not going to jail, Cody.
Gretchen, I understand this is difficult for you, but as your attorney, I need to put you on the stand so I can establish that you had no motive to kill Elke.
The jury needs to believe that you two were close.
We were close.
Can you imagine waking up to realize that you killed somebody you loved?
That's what I did.
So tomorrow, each of you will act as prosecutors, prepping each of the Thomases for their moment in the sun.
Dig in.
Anyone else feel like we do all her work for her?
Just figuring that out now?
I was fine with it before exams, but now that everyone else in our class is locked away in their apartments, studying, we're falling behind, working as free labor.
You know who doesn't care about exams?
You guys all go be boring, study.
Professor Keating wants to see you.
Pregnant?
Six weeks.
There was no sign of sexual trauma in the first autopsy, so they didn't inspect the uterus.
It'll be a few more days before the police release the final report, but the minute they do, they'll run a DNA test on Griffin to see if he was the father.
He's not, as we both know.
It's good for Rebecca's case.
But I would appreciate it if you didn't tell her.
If you didn't want her to know, why tell me?
Because I learned my lesson about keeping secrets from you.
Lila was pregnant.
It's Sam's?
Yeah, probably.
Of course not.
I just need to keep an eye on her till we figure out our next step.
It's not safe to be out here alone.
Why should I trust you?
I lost my job because of this case.
Lila... was pregnant.
Grab a sample of his hair from the bathroom.
I'll have someone at the station run a DNA test.
You in?
We did it.
I'm guessing it didn't hurt, by the look on your face.
It's not like how all my friends talk about their first time.
Swear you won't tell anyone?
Like I care enough about your stupid sex life to tell anyone.
I think I left my gloves here...
Greenish, 10 fingers.
Not gonna steal anything.
'Course not.
Must've fallen out... somewhere.
You should go.
Nice to see you, too.
It was a bloodbath...
No, but she told me she took it when we got into bed.
Then how can you be certain?
Objection... argumentative.
What are you doing?
You didn't ask an actual question.
The opposing lawyer would have no choice but to object.
I watch court TV.
Grandma hated Elke.
She felt like mom should be our mom, not some Scandinavian milkmaid.
Don't say that part on the stand.
We don't want anyone to think your grandmother had anything to do with it.
Maybe she did.
I'm kidding.
Then act like it.
Show a sliver of doubt or distrust, and the prosecution will pounce.
When did your mom finally come to?
What was her reaction when she realized what she'd done?
She started crying, yelling.
It was awful... for all of us.
It's the pill's fault.
Your witness.
Is it possible your parents told you to lie on the stand today, Cody?
He's badgering my witness, Your Honor.
Lying under oath is illegal, Cody.
I'm not lying about my mother.
Especially me.
What did you just say?
We loved each other.
Are you good for anything, or can you only do your job when you're screwing evidence out of someone?
Annalise, he did his best.
We were all blindsided by this.
That's all I ask.
I'm not worried, because I got a copy of the exam that she gave last year.
And I'm happy to share it with my new study group if they have things to give me in return.
I have every criminal-law hornbook ever written.
I think three people's enough for this study group.
What do you want?
What do you think?
Slow down, killer.
She's the one that sucks, not you.
Also, I'm having a little jammy-jam at my place tomorrow before the bonfire.
Drinks, pretty peeps... the ushe.
So I was hoping I could get off a little early tomorrow.
You can go home early as long as you get all your work done.
The night she was killed, I thought you were at Yale.
But I...
Rebecca came by the house.
Claims she was looking for her gloves.
That's sweet, isn't it?
Tell me what you want me to do here...
I'm gonna lose my case.
Because all I can think about is you with that girl.
That's all it took for you to knock her up?
This is what I get.
This is what happens when you screw somebody else's husband.
You become sad, barren.
And I'll do whatever it takes to make us right again.
Darcy wants to end it.
Tell me it's better this way.
I-I don't know.
Just, let's not talk about it.
Stay.
Is it sick if all I want to do is go over to his house and show his wife all the pictures of his junk on my phone?
That is normal.
Hey, it's me.
Sam texted Lila all the time.
There's got to be evidence on his phone still, right?
What... you didn't hear enough on the stand?
I was pissed.
Like, really... really angry.
I mean, no relationship is that perfect.
I never said it was perfect.
How'd the treasure hunt go?
All I came up with was a flaming penis.
Is that some sort of gay euphemism?
Just the sound of that hurts my ween.
Tinidazole.
I knew it.
Knew what?
That I just won our case for us.
Good luck with your little study group.
Mr. Thomas, what happened if your wife ever drank a glass of wine before taking her sleeping pill?
Then she was pretty much impossible to wake.
I'd have to just let her sleep it off, which is why Gretchen doesn't usually drink.
Anything else happen that day?
You mean the murder?
No, I mean what your son, Cody, told you.
Well... yes, but I-I had...
Medical records show that Mr. Thomas was taking the prescription tinidazole, which is a prescription used specifically to treat trichomoniasis.
Wrong... you were prescribed that drug three months before Cody came to you.
Because the truth is, you needed your own because you, too, were taking part in a sexual affair with Elke.
No, you needed her to stay out of it that night so you can go into Elke's room and stab her to death.
I'm so sorry.
It's too late for apologies, Mr. Thomas.
The defense rests.
He lied to you, betrayed you, took advantage of your loyalty and trust.
You'll thank me one day.
I thought you had the trophy.
No, but the fact that you're saying that means you think I deserve it, which I do.
I don't care who has the trophy, Ms. Pratt...
Of course it matters.
You built our entire semester on it.
Mrs. Walker.
What are you doing here?
Or do you not have time for your future mother-in-law?
Sports-driven university.
Lovely.
I know why you're here.
And while I realize a prenup is a delicate subject...
My husband and I built our company from the ground up.
The first store eventually became 10, 10 became 50, and now we run a multinational corporation.
So you understand why we will not allow you to waltz in and reap the benefits.
You sign, or I will make sure that you go back to that nasty, backwood, bayou swamp you came from, you stubborn bitch!
Hi, there.
What are you doing here?
Well, the firm gave me a few days off, and... thought I would surprise you.
Sasha... his girlfriend.
What is it?
I met Lila the night she was killed.
I need to see Annalise Keating.
Is this about Frank?
Do you need a lawyer?
Tell her it's about her husband.
She's not here.
I don't know who you are or what you think you're doing, but I guarantee you're going to regret this.
So just take a deep breath, calm down, and go home.
He can't keep it a secret anymore.
Which means... you knew.
This is me.
What good would it do to tell her now?
But we both know how much this would devastate Annie.
But I need you now more than ever.
And I thought Sam was at Yale that night.
I thought you two were working through things, so I didn't think...
He knew she was pregnant.
He told you that?
He's not a good man, Annalise.
Please.
Leave.
And don't come back.
Plug it into his computer.
It'll download all his phone information, including the coordinates where he was that night.
I'll call you when I get it.
I-I was just trying to do the right thing, for once.
You've done everything for me, risked everything.
I would've told you if you just trusted me.
Because this...
Annalise doesn't do anything without some sort of plan.
So her telling me Lila's pregnant, then sending her boyfriend?
I said I'm sorry.
I know.
Could've met at my place.
Bitches be crazy.
You're at... my place right now.
Yeah, my brain's too fried to get any studying done tonight.
I'm thinking no one's showed yet because people know the bonfire goes all night.
People want to be pacing themselves, you know?
Of course.
Wes, how do you even know she's inside?
I mean, maybe she just turned on music to throw you off.
She took it.
Took what?
Did you bring your car?
It's unorthodox, I know.
Thank you.
Who was that?
The DA's office.
Aria, if you don't want me to get married...
It has to do with you marrying zack.
Was he inappropriate with you?
Maybe he was with hanna.
She's getting wasted in the middle of the day.
And he's admitted to everything?
His story matches alison's.
The abduction, the blindfold, her escape.
I don't know.
You said you don't know?
What was I supposed to say, spencer?
How about "no"?
I was blindfolded, remember?
Well, it doesn't matter where "a" got it.
What matters is what "a" is planning to do now.
No, I don't need a creepy text to read the writing on the wall.
We don't know that anymore.
She's heartbroken.
What is that?
It's noel kahn's insurance policy.
Ali doesn't know you have this, right?
Well, maybe you should tell us where this is.
You know, just in case anything were to happen to you.
Good-bye, hanna.
Emily helped save my life.
She deserves to know what's going on.
The person you should be talking to is tanner.
That man knew every detail.
How would he know that unless he did it?
He confessed already.
Whatever you're afraid of, please, don't be.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I should have seen this coming.
I was too old for him, I was too trusting.
This isn't your fault.
You're the one that taught me that second chances exist.
Your bliss is still ahead of you.
Uh, I was eating that.
It's poison, caleb.
Nothing.
Just another day in the life of alison dilaurentis.
Okay, well then, toss her, not my fried zucchini.
To lose sleep over some stupid chorus audition.
I mean, is that what normal people do?
Normal people are not being hounded by "a".
Hey, how'd it go with ali?
You speaking in code now?
Seems like a good idea.
Roger wilco.
Zack went back to austria, but the place is still tainted.
What's gone?
The recording ali gave me and the medical exam, it's gone.
Just give me a second, okay?
Need any help?
I thought you left already.
We forgot the grocery list.
Looking for something or just redecorating?
Emily, I'll have to call you back later.
Next thing I knew I woke up blindfolded.
Something wrong?
Is that spencer?
Hanna?
You don't even know what it is yet.
What is going on?
Just watch the bushes.
Less than 24 hours before cyrus petrillo confessed.
That melissa stole the recording and gave it to him?
I mean, she always liked chess.
Look, aria, we cannot take anymore chances.
What are you saying?
I like knowing that you're safe.
How long till your dad gets back?
About an hour.
He's meeting with a social worker.
Why?
He thinks I'm afraid of retribution.
You love that, for once, everyone seems to believe you.
Did he know who you were?
Just that I was on the run.
What happened, ali?
He didn't want me.
Worse than nothing.
I'm sorry, ali.
"a" wants you to identify him.
You have to let him go.
You know that, right?
Carrot stick?
I don't want this in my house.
Okay, don't answer.
To turn on our friend?
Aria filled me in on your great idea.
It's not gonna happen, spencer.
What we should be doing is burning this stuff.
I'm sorry, what?
She doesn't want me to tell you.
I do.
We're either all in this together or we're not.
I did my part, I talked to ali.
If you really want to help, talk to your sister.
Ms. Adinolfi is on the phone with your mom.
Your mom's on her way.
How's your head?
You are not in this alone.
Right now it's an observation.
Did aria ask you to talk to me?
It's fine, dad.
We don't have much time.
You know, I think I'm just gonna get a refill.
What are you doing?
If you won't leave, I will.
Are you sure you want to do that?
Where are they going?
I just got access to tanner's phone.
170 to control.
What did you say to her?
Okay.
Why are you this upset?
Find what you were looking for?
No, not really.
I saw your computer.
I know you're looking at flights.
Are you trying to run away?
She's as toxic as ever.
We both know ali wasn't kidnapped.
So all of this is just sisterly concern?
Is it really that hard to believe?
What did you do, melissa?
And I'm asking you to your face this time.
You're my sister!
Does that mean nothing to you?
I'm trying, spencer!
The property has been abandoned for years.
Not a lot of neighbors around either.
Al, you okay?
I want you to meet my friends.
He could go out the front or the back.
Because I did.
Since when do you have panic attacks?
Since when do you get sauced before third period?
Why do you think I went on the offensive?
Lying to your boyfriend again.
Witness has identified 5th street house.
I repeat, do not release cyrus petrillo.
I'm the one confusing things, em.
And people don't just change because you want them to.
Hey, can I call you back?
My attempt to jumpstart my single life.
I may have gone a little overboard.
Which is why you shouldn't.
I thought so.
And I want to be able to trust him again.
Just start over.
But you're right, people don't change.
Aria, honey, that's not true.
People can change.
Even your dad has changed.
Mom, you don't have to try to make me feel better.
Ali, can I talk to you?
Dad, I'll be right in.
But I didn't understand.
You identified him?
Ali, I thought we were in this together.
I waited as long as I could.
When wasn't I there?
When hanna broke her leg because of "a"?
Oh, I'm sure you do.
I wasted so much time on you.
If all identified the guy, then how did he get away?
Once the clock struck 8:10, he was a free man.
"a" must have had a getaway car out back.
By the time tanner called in the id, he was gone.
Try a bacon calzone.
I love you.
What are you smiling about?
It's just a smile, spencer.
Don't sound so concerned.
But I really hope you can get on board.
I was beginning to think you might not show.
There's a warrant out for my arrest.
You're lucky there was even a deal at all.
I should have left you for dead when I found you.
You know I could have told them the truth about you.
So could I.
Then we'd both lose.
Now we both win.
This is your one chance to start over, cy.
You better use it.
Previously on Legends...
What's gonna happen when he finds out I've been lying to him for the past ten years?
Get back together with him.
Where was this photo taken?
There's nothing on record from 2003 to 2005.
It's like two years of their lives were erased.
How do you know me?
- What was I doing there?
It was a mess is what it was.
Your agent is in some serious trouble.
Don't get too comfortable here.
I figure you got two hours before they get here and smoke your ass.
I can get to Verax's personnel records, find out who you are.
You go on record to the U.S. attorney about Verax's activities, I'll get you out of here.
These things are gonna be delivering pizza soon.
They're gonna be delivering many things.
Mind if I give it a try?
Go pick it up.
This is great!
Carefully.
What's this thing on the bottom?
Extra battery.
The Hellfire missile you reported seeing... where is it?
It was gone when McGuire and Rice arrived later?
The place had been cleaned.
So, we have no way of verifying what you're saying?
You think I'm making this up?
The sniper who shot Dobson wasn't apprehended.
Ray Campbell was killed by another prisoner in police custody.
The same reason Evans and McCombs were murdered.
Verax Global Security?
One of the top contractors for the U.S. military?
Sounds like a conspiracy theory.
This is a waste of time.
The fact is you were acting in an extralegal capacity as a rogue agent.
Section 47 doesn't apply if Agent Odum acted without sanction.
We're all grateful for your service, Martin.
We have to assess this situation honestly.
Sounds like a fancy way of calling me a liar, sir.
Wait a second.
What the hell happened in there?
What did they say about Verax?
You have a problem with that, you talk to Gates.
I am your handler.
You work for me.
I want to know.
Pull out now or we're officially pregnant.
Americans speak of everything in terms of sex or money.
Real football.
What's it gonna be, Hassan?
I'll be ready.
Be advised, we are a go.
In 48 hours, the prince will be dead.
Well, you're still in the FBI.
How'd you pull that one off?
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
Well done.
- Do you want a drink?
We have one hell of a mess to clean up in Texas to cover your ass.
And, um, there's this.
All dead.
But, Martin, the photo's a fake.
What are you talking about?
Forensic analysis says they've been doctored.
Your head on somebody else's body.
Something about the pixels not lining up.
What, are they lying?
And, Martin, I'm gonna say this one last time.
You may not like that, but those are the facts.
So let's accept it and move on.
No more rogue investigations, Martin.
Now, I'm speaking to you as a friend here.
Do whatever it takes... poetry, flowers, I don't give a shit... just get back together with Sonya.
You need her.
She keeps you steady.
Spend some time with your son.
Martin, remind yourself who you are.
You were in a car accident.
When you woke up, you didn't remember much.
Not even me.
This must have been manipulated somehow 'cause I was never there.
We're the guys who don't exist, doing the things that didn't happen, following the orders that no one gave.
- Everything about him is fake.
It's Martin MacDonald Odum.
What I do know, he's supposed to be dead.
I'm not even supposed to be taking personal calls in here.
Your wife... you might want to warn her that you're not coming home.
Like, ever.
Yeah, I gathered that much.
This is Prince Abboud of the House of Saud.
An invaluable partner to this country, which makes him an enemy to a lot of people.
He's under constant threat of assassination.
Second only to the king himself, as I understand.
The prince will be in Los Angeles later this week for a highly classified energy meeting at the Arcadia Policy Council.
His visit had been under wraps.
Two days ago, the prince's classified itinerary was leaked from someone within the State Department.
Now CIA intel strongly suggests that there will be an attempt on his life during this visit.
Well, who at State had access?
I assume you already did an internal investigation?
So advocating for human rights makes him a suspect?
His papers are essentially polemics for regime change in Saudi Arabia.
How can DCO help?
If there's a threat... and Rawley's our guy... we need to know who he's passing this information to.
Let's test the leak.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Seriously?
Both, actually.
I'm advising Keller on the kingdom's proposed trade deals.
You know, the Saudis have the best lobbyists money can buy.
You're not gonna believe who's coming in tomorrow.
Prince Abboud.
Seriously?
The senator's meeting with the prince during his visit.
I know a place near here that's open late.
I'm in town until Thursday.
Take a rain check?
Uh, this is my cell.
We're in play.
Yup, we're here and waiting.
You know... fishing.
Waiting for a bite.
- It's part of the job, man.
- It's the part of the job where you sit with your fingers up your ass, isn't it?
You gonna be whining all night?
- He hit up the drive-thru on the way home.
He's approaching you guys in a cab now.
Copy that.
And there's our fish.
What's he doing there?
He just put something in that cup.
It was subtle, too.
See, that's spy-of-the-month, right there.
Unless you prefer, I don't know, going rogue and kidnapping somebody?
Yeah, if the occasion calls for it, sure.
Let's just say I didn't find what I was looking for.
Ooh, who's this lady?
Definitely not what I expected.
Maggie, we're sending the photos to run on facial recon.
Wow, she almost looks like, um...
She's on TV, like, all the time.
Her book is amazing.
Maggie, keep your eye on Rawley's building.
We're following Hani Jibril.
We don't know what Rawley told her about the prince's visit after we spoke.
It's definitely not enough to think that she intends to assassinate him.
Hani Jibril is not a killer.
She's one of my heroes.
She's a freedom fighter who's put her life on the line to stand up for equal rights for women.
Women can't vote in Saudi Arabia, they can't drive, they can't leave the house alone without a male escort.
Maggie, I get it, okay?
She's on the move.
You planning on following her?
Yeah, we put a tracker on her car.
While she's out, we thought we might do a bit of recon.
National Security exemption, Pocahontas.
Repairmen.
The Arab Spring is far from a revolution in bloom.
Put the badge on.
...yet the voices of discontent are no longer silent.
Oh, come on, give us a break.
We've come all the way from Balboa Park, in traffic.
Yeah?
I should not be any part of this.
So, uh, since when does it take two guys to fix a dishwasher?
I tell you... this does not look like an assassin's apartment, though, does it?
No weird, random, obsessive images on the walls.
Well, you think you know a person.
Let's get to work.
We know she's a critic of the kingdom, but does that make her an assassin?
Let's find out.
Upload her hard drive.
Hey, Rice, is it just me, or does the shutterbug outside seem interested in us?
FBI.
Pricey.
You got a license for this?
Why are you down here watching us, huh?
I wasn't watching you!
Ahmed Nomar Hassan.
Where are you from, Ahmed?
- He checks out.
Let me have a go at him first.
I don't like it, either, but that's the play here.
I'm afraid we owe you an apology, Mr. Hassan.
- I don't have to answer your questions.
- Just tell us what you were doing watching Ms. Jibril's apartment.
Same thing you were, I assume.
Checking her out for possible involvement in an assassination plot.
- We're done.
Seems to me we have a split decision on Ms. Jibril.
On the one hand, her agenda seems primarily to be about human rights, not about killing people.
I think we need to find more information.
Then let's get more information.
Rice, Martin, I want you to approach Hani Jibril in legend.
As Sebastian Egan?
That was my thought.
You're Sebastian Egan?
Writer, journalist, professional contrarian.
Never met a sacred cow he didn't try to slay.
He's a disillusioned socialist turned gadfly wit, turned seditionist, turned blasphemer.
Sebastian Egan is the most famous journalist no one's ever met.
These fanatics have far too much power.
They're bullies and criminals.
You cannot reason with them.
What women have to endure in Saudi Arabia is criminal.
Justice must be claimed by any means necessary.
I think the flaws that were born with the faith... the treatment of women, the lack of freedom, the pre-medieval way of life... lives on into the 21st century only because of the fanatics' influence.
And now I'll field some questions.
Ms. Jibril, have you considered the possibility that these fanatics, as you call them, were driven to this fanaticism because of a long list of crimes committed by the United States?
There comes a moment when you must crush your enemy.
Militarily?
In all forms.
I think we should fight theocracy all the way.
For free speech, for women's rights, for a more pluralistic democracy.
And I think you, sir, should be ashamed for mocking the very people who guard you while you sleep.
Anybody ever told Egan he drinks too much?
Yes, but I don't listen to bad advice.
Booze nourishes the spirit.
Hence, the categorical name, "spirits."
Sebastian Egan.
The infamous Sebastian Egan?
I thought your piece on Jamaah Islamiah was vital.
This is my trusted comrade, Helmut Newton.
Tony Baldwin.
We're here on assignment for Joust.
Mm, I've heard rumors.
I assume you'll be there, right?
Organizing a protest of some kind?
I've got something special planned for the prince.
I'd love for you two to cover it, actually.
Yes.
Uh... for posterity?
For publicity.
Excuse me.
So, what do you think?
I think she's an incredible woman, that's what I think.
You're telling me this woman wants to assassinate a Saudi prince?
Nah, of course not.
You ever get played while you were under?
It's Martin Odum.
You have to stay objective.
Part of the job.
I need to see you.
Usual spot, tomorrow, 3:30.
It's almost time.
We're on, but I think they know I leaked the itinerary.
They might be watching now.
I won't have the details of the prince's motorcade assignment until tomorrow.
Security's getting tight.
I understand.
Thank you, Aaron, for taking the risk.
Happy to do it, Hani.
I believe in your cause.
I'll contact you on this burner phone.
Sonya?
Sure.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
One day I think we should, the next day I don't.
What do you think he said?
Of course.
Just kidding.
It was in Malibu.
To stick together.
I just realized that we should try harder.
That we shouldn't give in.
I don't want to be with anyone else.
I want to be with you.
I'm crazy, remember?
- A lot of issues.
- I realize it's not gonna be easy, that we have a lot of stuff to work through.
You have things you have to work through.
But I want to try.
Together.
I don't want to give up on our family.
Thanks for giving me another chance.
The Prince's motorcade will take him from the Van Nuys Airport to the Arcadia Policy Council in Santa Monica.
His itinerary has him delivering a short speech to Arcadia's board and immediately departing.
- Tell me again why the prince didn't change his plans.
The prince is meeting with the most powerful people in the energy complex.
Which means the most powerful people in the world.
These people don't reschedule.
Ms. Jibril is lining up a protest at the Arcadia Policy Council.
If she's part of an assassination plot, we expect it will go down there.
All agents will stay in communication in the area.
Crystal and Maggie, I want you in the truck on scene.
Martin and Rice will be on ground with eyes on Ms. Jibril.
If the prince's security envelope cracks, they'll be in position to intercept.
On one side, the prince, with his trillions in oil wealth, the protection of the world energy oligarchy.
On your side, poster paper and Sharpies.
Let's not forget justice.
Rice, what's the situation?
Copy.
Prince's motorcade is ten minutes out.
The prince's motorcade will be heavily guarded.
If there's going to be an attack, chances are it will occur outside of Arcadia's complex.
We've got a lock on the prince's location.
He's closing in on Arcadia.
NSA intercepts say no suspicious chatter at this time.
- To effect suffrage in Saudi Arabia?
To the death.
Yours or his?
The prince's motorcade just arrived.
Keep eyes on Hani.
It's not time.
Just make sure you have enough battery... you're the witness.
The prince is heading inside.
Justice now!
Justice for women!
They will attempt a diversion.
I'll use the Stingray.
He'll be exiting through the east wing, and his security detail will be minimal.
I have to break through the firewall.
- Make it fast.
Royal security can get a bit twitchy, in my experience.
Let's follow her.
We hope that this joint report will provide some measure of guidance for the important decisions to come.
Okay, I got Rawley's location.
The motorcade is on the move.
We've got Rawley's position.
Martin, keep eyes on Hani.
What the hell is she thinking?
Hopefully not martyrdom.
I wish to speak to the prince.
I will talk to her.
Maggie, where am I going?
Hello, Ms. Jibril.
The time has come to change the appalling way the kingdom treats its women.
You promised me you would fix this, do you remember?
There's no one here!
Talk to me, Crystal.
I just found the phone.
Maggie, where is he?
Shoot me.
I will not wear this veil.
If I die, I die for all women.
- They will rise up and avenge me and you will lose this abomination forever.
This publicity stunt does not help matters!
Get back in the car, Your Highness.
- No, I'm not leaving.
- Let go of me.
- You want to get shot?
Shit!
Did the Captain say what was in the bottle that he wanted me to take?
No, he just said you had to drink it or something really bad would happen.
She boarded Lufthansa Flight to Vienna.
You cannot run.
I think she's telling the truth.
Some sort of severe head injury.
To connect this wesen... the nature of our defensive resources could be compromised.
It is not know how this wesen removes the memories of its victims, only that it can.
This is a key piece to the CVA project.
Just hurry up and get to Vickers.
Clear.
Ma'am, please do not come in here right.
Are you all right?
All payments to Weston steward were cash deposits made by a courier from Lisbon.
The courier was an independent contractor with no idea the cash came from us.
Are there any wild cards?
The king will be out for blood.
Whose blood depends on how careful we are.
Take it.
It's Adalind Schade.
Adalind, how nice to see you again.
We will need confirmation that what you did to Mr. Burkhardt actually succeeded.
I did what you wanted me to do.
Please let me in.
Please, I need to see my baby.
I'll get confirmation.
All right, open the gates.
How is she?
Wonderful.
How's Juliette handing this?
We're on our way.
Has she gained any weight?
I do wish I could've seen the look on Mr. Burkhardt's face when he realized he'd slept with you.
How was it, by the way?
I did what I had to do.
That's a shame.
It's not every day a Grimm shags a hexenbiest.
Or was it the other way around?
This is the most secure part of the castle.
No one can get your child here.
By the by, did you know Sean Renard is in hospital?
Nick shot him?
Actually, no.
I know how close you and Sean were.
It was taken from me by the resistance, the very people who helped you escape from me.
Now, don't you regret that decision?
Viktor, don't do this!
You can't do this!
Hi, this is Henry.
Get back to me as soon as you can.
Okay, he checked in to room 402.
How'd you find that out?
You're kidding, right?
We know he's the guy we're after, but now we're going to need some background on him to see how he connects with the victims.
Yeah, I wasn't talking about arresting him.
You know, this is beyond anything I've ever dealt with.
What if we can't help Nick this time?
Honey, all we can do is try.
The Captain must've known what Adalind did, because he brought something to give to Nick, but how do we find out what that was?
I don't know.
Find out where Adalind cooked it up.
Yeah, and reverse engineer it.
I mean, he had to get the stuff somewhere.
Unless he made it himself, because he is a zauberbiest, after all.
Right, zauberbiest.
Oh, Kent, that is awful news.
Let me give you my new number and address.
Actually... actually, that's why I'm calling.
He's been in an accident.
241165th.
I'm on my way.
Sean.
Mother.
Do we know what that is?
Let's see what kind of employee Lawrence Anderson is.
When did the accident take place?
Okay, and what was the injury?
Hold on, I'm gonna put you on speaker so my partner can hear this.
He suffered some kind of head injury.
Was he able to tell anybody what happened?
No, that's the real sad part.
MIT, Harvard, military intelligence... he was involved with military intelligence?
Oh, yeah, top security clearance, intimately involved with some pretty important government programs.
Now he doesn't even recognize his own daughter.
And there's no way to prove what he's stealing, 'cause it's all in his head, which means the CIA or the NSA will never know the extent of what he's got or what they've lost.
How do you explain that to the feds?
I don't know, but we may get a chance to try.
Here's Chavez.
Hank, I got this.
Is this on the record?
Off, just between you and me.
No.
Do you know why steward would want to kill Captain Renard?
No.
You understand the problem here, Detective?
Your Captain was shot in your house by one of our agents.
Sounds more like your problem than mine.
An FBI agent with no connection to a police Captain suggests, to me, that he was working for or with somebody else.
You think there's a conspiracy.
Unless you have a better word for it.
Why don't you tell me about the young lady living in your house, Theresa Rubel.
From what I found out, she's had a few problems.
Yeah, and I've been trying to help get her straightened out.
She's awfully handy with a machete.
Look, she's had some serious abuse issues.
I've been teaching her how to defend herself.
I didn't expect her to have to use it so soon.
She spent time in mental institutions.
And if she hadn't killed your agent, she'd be dead right now.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Not exactly your average, stone-cold killer.
She doesn't look very old.
Thinking 19 to 21, going on deadly.
Oh, thinking of becoming a cop?
You got to be kidding me.
What a shame.
The recipe's been in my family for generations.
Not that it's any good... more of a tradition than anything else.
How long do you plan on keeping her in there?
Until she gives up every member of the resistance who helped her escape.
You know, even in her current condition, she's still quite attractive.
Let the game begin.
Yeah, what's up?
Can I ask you something about the girl staying at Nick's house?
Yeah.
I'm just having a little problem trying to figure out why she's... you know, we're gonna have to talk about this later.
We're in the middle of an investigation.
We got to go.
And Trubel called.
Our Lawrence has left the hotel, and he changed his appearance.
She was supposed to... we all know what she was supposed to do.
I'm sure, I woged right in front of him.
I think I know who the Grimm is.
I'm gonna make sure.
Hey, Juliette, I'm so sorry we haven't found anything.
And Nick isn't so sure he wants this anymore.
So what I'm trying to say is, maybe we should just give it a little time to see if not being a Grimm is better than being one.
Yeah, there's a chance for us to have a normal life together.
Just because he can't see us doesn't know he doesn't know.
But shouldn't that be his decision?
How much time is a little time?
I don't know, but I think we need to keep looking anyway.
You're really here.
I thought it was a dream.
I was dead.
I suppose that's the second time you've given me life.
It hurt a lot more the first time.
Who did this to you?
Weston steward, a Hundjager working with the royal family.
I just remembered, I was supposed to give something very important to Nick Burkhardt.
So I'm a grandmother.
Not that you look it.
Tell me exactly where you are.
I don't know the details.
Tell me what happened.
Well, no one knows for sure, but we think it was some sort of home invasion.
He doesn't remember anything, doesn't even remember his own name.
How can something like this happen?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Do they have any suspects?
Not that I know of.
This is where Trubel said she'd be.
She's not answering.
Who's there?
Who are you?
I know you're there.
Please talk to me.
My name is Adalind.
My name is for me to know, and you to find out.
That's a good girl.
You've been following me.
Too young to be a cop, no I.D., $6.75 in your wallet, and a receipt for two Italian subs.
You must've been very hungry.
Now, why would somebody like you be following me?
Mr. Anderson, it's the hotel manager.
He's not violent, is he?
Call the police.
You can lie all you want, but I'll get the truth out of you.
Oh, God, you're a Grimm.
Get down.
Trubel, do you know who I am?
Yeah, Nick, I know who you are.
My head hurts.
Who are you?
Where do you live?
So we caught ourselves a spy.
You know, I was just thinking, all that stuff he stole from peoples' memories... what do you think he got from Trubel?
How are you feeling?
Better than I was.
Listen, Nick, did you get what I brought to your house for you?
No, it's gone.
I'm not a Grimm anymore.
I should've known what Adalind was up to.
I'm just glad the young lady staying at your house knew how to handle a machete.
Bacon, that's all I want.
How do you feel?
Well, my neck hurts, but I haven't slept that good in a long time.
See you guys later.
How you doing with all this?
I don't know if using her to help me is a good idea.
Even if she could, I doubt it would last.
I got it.
We need to talk.
She's a suspect in a double homicide, and I'm having a bit of a problem with this.
You see, she was introduced to me as a criminology student, and I'm pretty sure she's the same young woman who's staying with you.
Can you clear this up for me?
Look, it's complicated.
I... you okay?
Yeah, my head hurts.
- I don't know.
Juliette?
Where are you?
What the hell?
You all right?
I'm not sure.
Get off of me!
Go, go.
Meredith's gone, she hung herself.
Where the hell did you come from?
Not anymore.
My arm's falling asleep.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I think this is good.
Yeah, this is good.
Preliminary notes on firearm discharge incident.
Assailant armed with sound-suppressor equipped Walther P88...
I might have to miss the first game of the season.
Have you done it before?
Two other times.
It's not easy, taking a man's life, even someone who forces you to do it.
How do you deal with it?
How do you do that?
I used to do it by drinking.
You and your friends, the way you guys handle things, it doesn't seem to faze you like it should.
It's like you guys know something I don't.
Is three enough?
You don't have to be part of it if you don't want to.
I'm not scared.
Then you're borderline idiotic.
Because the tape from Garrett's bag said visual confirmation required.
So the idea is, what if you kill someone on the dead pool, but you can't send the proof?
You don't get paid.
But how does that get us any closer to The Benefactor?
So, if he wants visual confirmation...
He's going to have to come get it himself.
I'm calling it.
Time of death 2102 hours.
Would someone please page Melissa McCall?
What are you doing?
Some wounds take longer.
So, what's going on?
Maybe I'm just tired.
You just saw them.
Show me your real eyes.
What happened to my son?
Are you guys totally sure about this?
I think Liam's kind of nervous.
Maybe you should tell him it's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.
So, you've done this before, right?
I've seen it done.
Is that just as good?
Put your hand over his heart.
Good dreams or bad?
I still hate this plan.
Is that enough to keep a werewolf alive?
Enough for an Alpha.
No, I mean what happens if he stays like this longer than forty-five minutes?
Type this, "Visual confirmation isn't possible."
"Police coming to claim body in forty minutes."
And if the wire transfer isn't completed in forty minutes...
That's probably something you've never had to worry about before, is it?
So, it's everything then?
No glowing eyes, no healing.
Sm hearing, speed, everything.
Strength?
I can still win a fight.
I'm gonna teach you how to bend.
Try it now.
Catch!
That's why you're team captain.
Someone has to.
We don't have to...
I've gotta buy a better safe.
What about him?
No, he's in here every week with a new self-diagnosis.
Hypochondriac?
Prescription drug addict.
Because otherwise we'd be asking them to run and hide.
Is that supposed to look like that?
That's why I'm bringing this.
Kids.
I can't let you leave here with that.
Maybe you won't have a choice.
Is that right?
I think I could take you.
You've heard rumors I'm not as strong as I used to be.
Something like that.
Nothing.
The Open House is next week.
Okay, I followed you.
Honey, you come up here every weekend, sometimes even during the week, and as far as I can tell, there's no boy involved, so I really have no clue what you're up to.
And honestly, Mom, you don't need to be involved in every single detail of my life.
Do you know her?
Meredith Walker.
Catch!
That's why you're the Alpha.
There's something different, isn't there?
I've got more fangs.
I noticed it during the quarantine.
I don't know why.
Maybe it's part of being an Alpha.
Like you're becoming more of a werewolf.
Evolving.
Looks like someone did something to it.
I think somebody did...
Stay with Scott.
Text me if you see or hear anything.
This is a Sig Sauer P2269mm.
I don't like guns.
That's because you've never learned to use one.
You'll like this one.
The legal clip size in California is ten.
You always want to remember how many shots you fire.
But using a gun isn't just about learning how to point and shoot.
If they have a knife, they can gut you before you can pull and fire.
So with a gun, you need distance.
One more time.
I could do this all day.
You cheated.
I'm learning to bend.
You wanna talk about it?
See a family counselor?
There's nothing in there.
Cost me a lot of money to get that file.
You got ripped off.
You know what happens when you only hear one side of a story?
You've only heard one side of the story.
It's a good plan.
You're not worried, are you?
That we've never actually been on a real date.
There hasn't been time.
We could make time.
Maybe after that.
We could see a movie.
Haven't seen a movie in forever.
That sounds like a plan.
It's a good plan.
I'm guessing the power doesn't go out often in this hospital.
Only when under attack by supernatural creatures.
Then what do you want with the body?
I wish I could tell you.
I always forget you carry two.
A fire that nearly burned me alive.
Unable to do anything other than listen to your own thoughts slowly driving you absolutely and totally insane, minute-by-minute, day-by-day.
Yes, I've done horrible, terrible things.
And so have a lot of people.
But not yours.
True.
But I am not The Benefactor.
I'm just a guy who's out millions of dollars.
A few thousand of which I used trying to help you.
By doing an act of kindness.
What could you ever do for me?
Help you find your mother.
I'm pretty interested myself as the memory was stolen from me by my sister, Talia.
A woman, might be her.
Are you still a Kitsune?
Technically.
These are your grandmother's ashes.
Grandma died in Eichen House.
Your father had a difficult relationship with his mother.
Well, she said she heard things.
Why did she want her ashes in here?
Well, actually, she didn't.
She left instructions to have them spread across the lake.
How come you haven't done it?
Because she wanted you to do it.
When you turned eighteen.
Don't ask me why.
Mom, these aren't Grandma's ashes.
No.
It's Mountain Ash.
Back off!
You sure you can pull the trigger fast enough?
I don't want to.
Okay, well, obviously, you guys have a lot to talk about, so, maybe I saw some coffee, a vending machine outside.
If killing Scott was part of it, you're worse than me.
That's why I'm here.
Then back off and let us do what we planned.
Take the Berserkers, and go.
Kate, please.
We have a plan.
Catch!
Why did you do that?
Let me help you.
Let me show you how.
What?
You were right.
He's still alive.
Thank God.
Where have you been?
Talking to Peter.
If he can help me find my mother, I don't think I care.
You might be related to him, but you're not like him.
Maybe I am.
That night I caused the car crash...
You mean when you were out-of-control on the full moon.
There's a part I didn't tell you about.
Killing doesn't run in a family.
Maybe it does in mine.
But she's going to be okay?
I need to be there with her.
They want to do a bunch of tests since I was kind of officially dead.
It was a good plan.
Yeah, I've been thinking about that too.
And actually, I think maybe it did work.
That's why it might have worked.
A Banshee.
This was the last thing your grandmother wrote down before she died.
Don't even know why I kept it because it's basically nonsense.
I mean, she has to be.
This isn't nonsense, Mom.
It's code.
What makes you laugh?
A little extra for you this week, Sunflower.
Come in now.
Give it back!
How much do we have?
I'm busy.
When I'm finished counting, I will tell you.
Do we have enough to go to the festival?
All I said was that I want to go to the festival.
Play for a little while only.
And what do we buy food with?
Maybe you aren't as stupid as I thought, Sidao.
I'm sorry, Mei Lin.
Great Khan, please!
Lower your eyes when you speak to the Khan of Khans!
I never meant to harm you!
Who sent you?
Chancellor Jia Sidao.
He instructed you to kill the Empress?
At first, I was to gather knowledge of your court.
But he sent an emissary the night of the White Moon with new orders.
Why the Empress, not the Khan?
Who knows my brother's mind?
Brother?
Who is the emissary you speak of?
No, she fled.
- Whore.
How dare you speak to me of love?
My words can save so many lives.
All I ask is that you save one.
Remove her.
The concubine was a tool.
Like a sword, she has no say into whose body she is thrust.
You wanted her head yourself.
What I wanted in a weaker moment, husband, I resisted.
I ask you do the same.
Allow her life.
To have Buddha on our side is a great ally, I know this.
Kublai, you quote whatever holiness suits you at the time.
Are there no shallows in the lake of your compassion?
Just because she is a mother who weeps for her child?
Because she is the sister of our greatest enemy!
And an agent of the Song court.
If you spare her... you may use her.
Fine.
If the bitch lives, she lives with the knowledge that everyone she knew has died by my sword.
If you attack Xiangyang, thousands will perish.
Tens of thousands.
I will not bathe in that blood.
I will not have war in my name.
I deserve revenge.
As do I, my love.
But do not use a battering ram when an arrow will do.
Let your vengeance fly exactly, Kublai.
There is a better way.
I've heard the songs they sing about you.
How your brother crawled up and into the Imperial Court through the wet spot in your bed.
Whose prisoner am I?
You are the prisoner of the Grand Khan.
Then why am I in your quarters?
All currency is my jurisdiction.
And whores are bought and sold.
Why does your brother want Empress Chabi dead?
To defeat Kublai in the shadow of the Walled City would win Sidao great fame and save the Song dynasty.
If the Khan leaves these gates, he brings the wrath of Genghis.
Has your brother no wisdom?
Some men have mastered wisdom, some devilry.
Does Sidao hide devilry behind the walls of Xiangyang?
I want to see!
Ling!
I missed you.
I've missed you, too, sweet one.
Something pains you, my child.
What I'm about to confess could lose me my head.
I have lied to the Chancellor.
Jia Sidao sent me to Cambulac to find Mei Lin and charge her to assassinate the Mongol queen.
Lady Chabi is dead?
No, Empress.
It's only a matter of time before the Chancellor discovers my deceit.
I have signed my own decree of death.
And Ling's too, I fear.
Then a lie must last one day longer.
When the sun sets tomorrow, so will Sidao's service.
He's done.
And Ling?
Be strong, young one, for your charge and for your future.
You are a Taoist monk.
I devoted my life to the service of the Great Khan and his empire.
I only have so much time on this earth.
You are blessed, Lord Kublai.
I give her gold to keep it in the abyss she calls a mouth.
My third wife... she has small and wrinkled teats, like the dried fruit on a fig tree.
But Chabi... she is an irreproachable gift from the Eternal Blue Sky.
Some may question the wisdom of sending a blind monk to assassinate the prime minister.
A blind monk who once killed 25 of my best soldiers.
A Wudang warrior said to be able to pass through walls unseen.
Suddenly, you are lame?
And should I pass through the open gates of Cambulac, what makes you think I will ever return?
What makes you think I want you to?
The Latin, is he accomplished?
For someone who has no accomplishments.
Good.
He will be your eyes and escort.
You do not listen, do you?
Oh, I do listen.
Then I hear what I want to.
Has she summoned all the women of the Hall of Fragrance?
Only you.
She has never invited me for a private audience.
Be calm.
Lady Chabi knows nothing of your past.
You are the Blue Princess of Bayaut.
No one will challenge this.
I challenge it.
Worry not, Princess.
Or further from our demons.
Now, imagine a wall stretching far closer to the sky.
Xiangyang.
I present to you the gerege.
With this golden tablet, gates will open before you as you ride to the south.
You will infiltrate the Song fortress.
While Hundred Eyes attends to his task, you will gather information as to the defenses of the rebels.
May I inquire as to Hundred Eyes' task?
He will kill Chancellor Jia Sidao.
Sidao's sister has an ally within the walls.
Another whore by the name of Jing Fei.
She also utilized a treacherous stable-boy from our slums to send messages to Xiangyang.
That is all we have learned at this time.
The Song coronation draws near.
In that moment, the Empress Dowager will preside over a shift in power.
Sidao seeks to secure war before that happens.
Securing war secures his power.
His death averts it.
Ride swiftly, Master Marco.
Mei Lin has a message she would like delivered to Jing Fei.
I do not know these names you speak.
Your family, their village, is it far from here?
No, Chancellor.
What would you have me call you?
What do you like?
You are my Chancellor.
Which village is it?
Luzhi.
I do not know it.
It is quite insignificant.
Impossible.
It produced you.
Why?
They do not approve of me.
They are ashamed.
There are so many rules.
It is the rules that build the walls.
To keep us apart.
And no matter how we wish to break those walls down... the rules allow no margin.
So there we are, resting our hands on either side of the divide.
No matter the side, we are just people.
That's why I did what I did.
For you people.
Do you believe that to be true?
I believe your heart and your mind are true to one another.
In this moment... you are most significant to me.
Do you wish to take me, my Chancellor?
The Khan's wife is dead.
Mei Lin announced her cause and you her master as she slew the Empress.
Do you wish to take me?
I wish to pay a visit to your parents' house... to try to correct their way of thinking.
We've got to keep moving.
The scum have attacked our father, the Lord Khan!
The vermin have attacked the Empress!
The Song have vowed to destroy everything that we prize and hold dear!
Do the sons of Genghis accept this quietly?
My men and the men who follow Princess Khutulun become one force with one purpose!
To teach the Song devils that we are Mongols and the world is ours!
Why should we follow the Princess?
I understand your apprehension.
What does a girl know of battle?
What of your great-grandmothers who rode into war with Genghis Khan?
And you are not the lioness!
Is the Hall of Fragrance suitable to your comfort?
Yes, it is most pleasing.
Tell me about the palace in which you were raised.
It pales beside the palace of the Lord Khan.
You miss it?
What became of her?
She died.
During the siege?
You have friends here in Cambulac?
My eunuch cares for me well.
What of your sisters in the Hall of Fragrance?
They have little understanding of the people or of the land.
You find them unworthy?
They're worthy in their ways but know not of the horse and bow.
Life's truest pleasures.
My days of riding unfettered have long since passed.
We were raised in very similar fashion.
Perhaps we might ride together one day, Empress.
Tell me, Princess... how do you see your future?
My Lady?
You know that you will not inhabit the Hall of Fragrance forever.
I never really think about it.
You may open your heart to me.
I was once your age.
I know the dreams that cloud a royal virgin's head.
I may have wondered.
Who is the lucky man of your thoughts?
Is he a prince?
A king?
Power and prestige are the concern of the other girls, Lady Chabi.
Surely, when you close your eyes at night, you pray for a man of noble character.
To give my future husband many sons, that is all I pray for.
We shall talk much, Princess.
My father sent Polo to assassinate our enemy.
I have this terrible recurring thought.
Perhaps the wrong brother fell bloody in the dirt all those months ago.
Do not repeat those words aloud, my Prince.
I will forget them myself.
Make no mistake, Ahmad, I love my father, I revered him.
"Revered"?
The kingdom has turned its eyes away as it relates to my father's pets.
But no other has risen so quickly or closely to his side than the Latin.
"Open the gates to outsiders and secrets will spill."
My uncle said those words to me when I traveled to Karakorum.
He may not have been referring specifically to the round-eyed rat, but he could sense it.
But if he fails and if the Khan is not motivated to push the boy aside by his own hand, then we will guide it for him.
The death of Empress Chabi puts us in a position of power.
It was the act of a coward and a scoundrel.
What lives will our people have when they're enslaved by the Mongol hordes?
I so tire of this conversation.
The coronation is upon us.
You will be filled with vigor soon enough.
And in the end, you may have achieved what you set out to.
Our position at the negotiating table has been weakened by your foolish play against the Khan.
And this is why I suggest, once more, that we postpone the transfer of power until certainty dawns.
Did your sister fall?
One can only assume.
Is there no hole in your heart?
Do you not fear the admission to a daughter who must face a life without a mother?
Life will continue.
After you've packed your porcelain, we will clean up the shambles you've left behind.
What choice do I have?
You have succeeded in your mission, Empress.
May I remain after the ink has dried?
To bear witness the outcome of your bargains with the devil.
You are a free man, Jia Sidao.
Free from responsibility, free from blame, free to stake your claim wherever you see fit.
Outside the palace.
You will always be a citizen of the Song.
If only that were true.
It is as if the gates of hell have opened.
It is the warm embrace of home.
When did you last feel it?
Be mindful of our mission, Master Polo.
It is a hard thing we do.
A hard thing you do, Sifu.
I draw pictures while you draw blood.
The Khan makes considerations for my failure and entrusts you with them.
That is no small thing.
This may not end well.
You continue on, however.
One death weighed against a massacre.
And should we fail, we fail for a true cause.
Did I say something to amuse you?
I fear your mind has followed your body into bondage.
You do not believe in the cause?
What one chooses to believe in and what one is compelled to believe in, there is a difference.
Don't stop.
Stop!
What is your purpose here?
Open up, show me!
In honor of the Emperor.
You wish to confiscate the food of His Holiness?
Where is she?
She is favored by the Chancellor.
I will not bring her round in the light of day.
Do you believe me?
I could have left you at the gate, monk.
Once I finish, I will no longer be at your service... yes?
My son, home from the hunt.
I see your new hawk proves well.
A fruitful and welcome diversion.
Were you on the grasslands?
Your mother is a lovely rider.
I can only assume the Princess is as well.
It was difficult to discern through all the dust kicked in my face.
He stands several hands higher than a Mongol pony.
Mongolian crossed with warmer blood.
Mother.
Do I embarrass you?
He is quite handsome.
My daughter.
Princess.
Shall we continue?
Are you planning on whittling her down to a skewer for the open fire?
I think you're ready.
I'm more than ready.
War is easy.
The waiting will kill you.
How do you call your shiny friend?
Decisive.
That's a beneficial trait for the one who wields her.
As well as for the one about to receive its sharpened end.
Do you wish to talk about it?
What is there to talk about?
I have seen you defeat far more proficient wrestlers than me.
I do not have the skills...
Or the balls to marry me.
So it was a ploy.
You lost by design in order to secure my hand in marriage.
You think much of yourself, Byamba.
If I wanted you, I would have had you years ago.
But for now, I am engaged to Decisive.
I would never sever you from your blade.
You needn't sacrifice one for the other.
The other?
You are.
We need to speak about Mei Lin.
She is dead?
She was spared for the sake of her daughter.
She said you could help us.
I do not have the time to earn it.
Your choice.
I come from Cambulac with news of the Great Khan's pending assault on your city.
Thousands from the barbarian horde will descend.
Song blood will flow like the Yangtze.
And you want me to help you bring this about?
I want you to help us prevent it.
You must listen to me, Tulga.
It has become clear that she seeks another bride for the Prince.
We can be miles away before she notices you are gone.
That is impossible.
What are you saying?
You must leave this place without me.
Someday, we shall be as one in the Blue Sky, if not before.
For now, you must leave.
Do not contact me again.
Where were you?
I came to you, earlier.
My apologies, my Chancellor, for not being present for you.
A gift from our brothers-in-arms in Quinsai... for our Emperor's coronation.
A peculiar substance.
Where were you?
At the pleasure house.
I fear for my future in this house when you are gone.
I sought assurance from the madam that I might return to service.
I will not have it.
I have no choice.
My meager skills demand it.
Do not say that.
I was mistaken.
I did not know your heart at the time.
We carry this holy edict in name of our benevolent Emperor on this, his coronation day.
May his virtue extend to the boundaries of heaven.
May his benevolence sustain the world.
I will be here with horses when you finish, Sifu.
Godspeed.
To exalt virtue, so that all should cherish the spirit of kindness and meekness, and that they should all enjoy a reign of eternal peace.
Do you believe in it?
I do not judge the decisions that you have made, and I will not understand until you set a scholar's pen to parchment.
May his righteousness guide the teeming multitudes of Song dynasty with great reverence and by the 16 Maxims of The Sacred Edict.
Who sent you, monk?
Come with us.
He'll keep you safe.
Jing Fei!
Are you prepared to take your throne, my Emperor?
They work at pace to repair it.
But as of now... that is our way in.
The Great Genghis, he of the wolf, dreamed of a Mongol empire stretching throughout all of China.
I have sought to realize his dream without spilling Mongol blood.
I have been patient.
My patience has been rewarded... with the severed heads of men who have marched beside you.
My scholars, ministers advised me to choose peace over war.
But I am a proud Mongol.
At times... peace can only be achieved through cruel war.
We begin the expedition to fulfill our destiny.
Those of you who do not return will have your names carved in the Secret History of the Mongols.
Your wives, children and parents will hold their heads above other Mongols, because in their hearts they know their husbands, fathers, their sons gave their lives in pursuit of the last dream of our Great Genghis!
March!
I don't have your baby.
Can I ask you something about the girl staying at Nick's house?
What the hell?
I don't know where I am.
I don't know where I was.
You said you saw something.
Some kind of old room.
I see you.
No, no, wait, please.
Let me go!
Look at me.
You're the Grimm.
I'm sure he was surprised to see what you are.
Detective Burkhardt took you in.
Does he know you're a Grimm?
Listen carefully.
There are people who find what you are and what you can do very important.
They would be extremely interested in your services.
What you're doing now is not nearly as important as what you can be doing.
Being able to identify and destroy dangerous wesen influence in society is a very valuable gift.
I'm sorry we had to do it like this, but I had to make sure you were who I thought you were.
I'll be in touch.
No chest pains, slurring of speech, pains radiating down your left arm?
Are you ready for the main event?
How you feeling, huh?
You're gonna be world champion someday.
Please, don't.
Let's get him out there.
Let's go, kid.
- It's not enough.
- Get the hell out of here.
This ain't over.
Fight.
Come on, Clay.
You coming to bed?
Yeah, it's got to be connected.
Being a Grimm?
Look, I'm sorry.
He wanted to know why we have a murder suspect staying with us, and why Hank and I introduced her as a criminology student at a crime scene.
I think you're gonna have to tell him the truth, Nick.
I'm not a Grimm anymore.
What am I supposed to tell him?
I expect that contract this afternoon.
You booked another fight?
He was in the ring all of 37 seconds, Abe.
Three more wins... just three more and we're fighting in Las Vegas.
Now get your ass out there and tell him.
Yeah, who's this?
Clay messed me up, man.
You got to make this right or I'm reporting you to the commission, and they'll pull your license for what you do.
25 grand or you're done.
Damage to the optic nerve can cause blind spots, pain, distorted vision... but your nerves look healthy.
Most people have three types... blue, green, and red... and the overlap of these cones allows people to see a spectrum of colors.
A small percentage of women have a fourth cone that allows them to see colors invisible to the rest of us.
Are you suggesting that Nick has a fourth cone?
In the area where the abnormality appears, there could be a fourth or even a fifth cone.
Not that I know of.
Not a surprise.
Since no one can really see the world the way everyone else sees it, people with special vision tend to be unaware of it.
Is this something that could have just appeared recently?
No, he'd have been born with it.
Then what's causing the headaches?
There's some swelling in the area, which may be preventing light from triggering the cones.
Now, whether that's temporary or permanent, I don't know.
It's just, she actually asked us... didn't so much ask.
More suggested.
But there are a lot of bad wesen.
Very few good Grimms.
What... it's not my business, anyway.
Look, it's about the wedding and that girl.
She's a Grimm, and you know, there's a lot of talk around.
Oh, well, that's a relief.
You know, in a way, maybe it's sort of good news.
Oh, my God, he's blind?
No, bud, he can't see wesen.
You know, probably best you don't tell anybody about this, okay?
I got to get home and not tell anybody.
You got my money?
What'd the doctor say?
It's all good.
What have we got, Wu?
"Bang bang" was on his license?
We got an address for bang bang?
He's right over there.
Nick, we really need to talk.
Yeah, later.
Do you know where your brother, Bobby, was last night?
He got busted up real bad the night before.
When I got home from work, I saw his face.
What was he doing at the fights?
He was picking up work, maybe?
He was damn good.
He just got hit too many times.
If I hadn't given her to Victor, he would've killed me and you.
So you had no choice but to give my granddaughter to the royals?
I know you better than that.
You wouldn't have given her to Victor, but giving her to the resistance wouldn't have guaranteed her safety, either.
However, it would be advantageous if the royals thought the resistance had her.
Are you gonna tell me where she really is?
I don't know, but she's with someone who owes allegiance to no one.
You're not well enough.
No, we... we don't need to take you away from your son at a time like this.
Don't be afraid of me.
Oh, afraid?
Clay, come over.
His trainer, Abe Tucker.
- We're investigating a murder.
Hey, I don't know what you were told, but Bobby was in no condition to work anymore.
I mean, he was a great fighter in his day, but he stayed in the game too long.
That's about all he could do.
And don't you have security for that?
I help ex-boxers whenever I can.
Bobby's sister said he was pretty beat up the other night.
Wouldn't have been the first time.
Bobby was one of the guys in my dressing room.
We believe Kingston?
Did you just ask if I believe a fight promoter?
Whoever gave him that beating had to know how to handle themselves.
Stan did two years for fraud and tax evasion, was acquitted in '07 of manslaughter, settled six lawsuits with ex-fighters out of court, but still got his promoter's license.
What have you got on the kid?
Still lives with his mom.
Been in the fight game for less than one year.
She could tell us what kind of wesen we're dealing with.
She almost got killed last time, Hank.
And I'm not.
What are we supposed to do, bring her in to every case that we think involves a wesen?
That's not fair to her.
The more you teach her, the better she's going to be, and until we find out what's going on with you, we need her to be her best.
Oh, that smell.
This is where she mixed it.
Look for a book that won't open.
Just find it.
What's up?
Got a boxer who might have been involved in a murder.
I like boxing gyms.
Well, don't use them.
The boxer we're looking at is Clay Pittman.
She'll be fine.
Oh, I am.
Works hard.
Sometimes, I wish he'd just go out with his friends.
How long has Clay been with Stan Kingston?
Oh, Stan discovered Clay about a year ago.
He told me my son had something special.
He's a... he's a good manager... oh, and his trainer Abe, too.
It's hard to know who to trust.
But you trust Stan?
His cell phone was in the seat.
I need to know if he called anyone associated with the boxing gym.
Yeah, what do they call you?
How do you not like nicknames?
They got Bone Crusher, Boom Boom, Sugar Ray.
- All boxers have cool names.
Didn't have one.
You serious?
You ask a lot of questions.
I mean, why do you do it if you don't like it?
This ain't no social club.
Go get ready for tonight.
Looking to get a few bouts, make a little money.
Really?
Let's see what you got.
Guess I'm getting in.
Abe, glove her up.
Keep your hands up.
Didn't I tell her not to get in any fights?
- We got to stop this.
- You fight dirty.
- Sorry, I... yeah, I like dirty.
You got a lot of potential, kid.
Abe is gonna start training you full time tomorrow.
Keep Clay in the dressing room while I deal with this.
Keep showing up, you're gonna have to pay gym fees.
A few more questions.
Oh, I need to get my boy ready for a fight.
Bobby Moore called you at 3 P.M. yesterday.
And you just forgot to mention that this morning?
I got more on my plate than worrying about a drunk has-been.
- He say where we was?
I-I can't do it anymore.
No more fights, Abe.
Please, you tell Stan for me.
Tell Stan what?
Cops are asking a lot of questions about you, Clay.
Gonna make your momma proud.
I make those decisions, not you.
This kid is going all the way.
Cancel the fight or I'll tell Clay the truth about what happened to Bobby.
It's over.
If I could show you how to get out of here, would you be happy?
Six stones in, three stones high.
Six stones in, three stones high... through the wall you must try.
My name is Hofmann.
You want to find your baby?
Please, get me out of here.
It's a treacherous journey.
You will need your strength.
I mean, that's a good idea, 'cause that'll open it right up.
Please, tell me that hurt.
Here's the spell she used.
It's contaminated.
What about this?
This beast cannot be trusted." Okay, here we are.
"Schinderdiv use their brutal force to pin their victim, and razor sharp tusks to inflict damage."
Same type of puncture wounds.
What about this wesen?
- That's Abe, only he looks a lot older than that.
So they inherit this great ability, but they don't want to use it.
I bet Clay's the same type of wesen.
He doesn't even like boxing.
Wait here.
It's quite a jump.
Looks like he's got more holes in him than rebar.
What is it?
A note.
You think Stan was having steak with Abe this time?
This is harassment.
You're not going anywhere.
You killed Bobby and Abe.
You must have some pretty good evidence to make a charge like that.
We do.
You're wesen.
Got no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, yeah, you do.
You're a schinderdiv.
You don't know anything.
You broke his neck.
Oh, I didn't mean to kill him.
Calling it in.
Tell Clay he doesn't have to fight.
Where's Stan?
I don't know.
Abe's not here, either.
Now, the fans and the reporters... they're all waiting for you.
I know, mom.
I got you the best manager and the best trainer.
And they did what I told them to.
And when they didn't, I did.
Now, you get out there, and you do what you were born to do.
You get out there, and you fight.
Dead?
She's a Grimm.
No, Clay, don't.
I'm done.
Clay... no, Clay, wait.
Hopefully, you'll have what we need.
Both.
- Gypsum extract.
- Uh, third shelf, far right.
You too.
I need to know that I'm not making a mistake.
Well, Jane is studying for the midterm, so we can't go there.
I thought everyone left the city over the holidays.
Max has got nowhere to go.
Well, we could go to a museum.
Her and a friend are taking the kids upstate, skiing, then back tonight.
What do you mean?
You could stay there when you come to town.
That sounds good.
Move out?
I promise it'll be worth the wait.
Anything wrong?
Hey, what time's your train?
Half hour.
That's the closet over there.
Is it?
It's perfect for a writer's office, and then you can stay there whenever you're in the city.
That's a place you put your mistress so you can fuck her when you want.
I have four kids!
You're the one who brought it up this morning.
That's nine months away.
Which is nothing when you're talking about breaking up your fucking family and ruining your children's lives.
Why don't you just say it?
Hi.
Have a nice night.
You too.
Alison Bailey, as I live and breathe.
You're still seeing that guy?
Did he break your heart?
It's hard to love someone who doesn't love you back, right?
It didn't work, but... you want to fuck me, Oscar?
What?
You do, right?
Hey, I'm making pancakes.
Not hungry.
That's okay.
You want to go for a drive?
There's a crafts fair in amagansett.
Thinking of getting a real tree this year, spruce the place up a bit.
I have to go home.
Back to your husband?
Man, what does that even mean to you?
Eat shit, Oscar.
I won't be here in 15 years.
We're selling the ranch.
A lot of money in that place, huh?
I don't believe you.
I'm sorry, Bailey.
I don't want to be the one to tell you.
He... he said it's been refinanced so many times, it's not really yours anymore.
He saw the files at the county clerk's.
- You got to do it yourself.
It's gonna keep us solvent until the summer people return.
There's no money left.
When you sell the ranch, the bank could just take everything...
We're not gonna sell.
He was upset about his brother, which I understand, but you can't make a sentimental decision like that about something so big.
I'm gonna wait until the commercial loan comes through, and then I'm gonna sit the boys down and I'll tell them the good news.
Don't you understand?
They all think they're about to be rich.
If you don't tell them, I will.
He already knows.
I told him.
What?
I told you to take him to the hospital.
I have lived to regret that restraint so deeply.
You've been lying to us all.
Alison, I have tried so hard for so long to find love in my heart to forgive you, and you just become more and more hateful.
A little girl came in here the other day.
Let's go have a talk, okay?
You want to tell me what's going on?
I've been thinking of the night gabriel died.
What happened?
What do you mean?
Why I don't remember.
It's starting to slip away from me.
Well, I remember a party on a beach.
I remember a bonfire.
I remember... All the kids were in the water, and gabriel was in the water.
Yeah, I thought he... he's gonna be cold when he gets out, so I went to get a blanket from the house.
Cole was watching him.
And by the time I got back, they were pulling him out of the water.
And then he... he sat up and he hugged me.
First time in years.
These cases are so rare, they're impossible to catch.
Easy.
- Come on, breathe.
It wasn't your fault.
This is why secondary drowning is so dangerous, especially in young children, because it just looks like they're tired, just like any kid who spent the day at the beach.
There's no way you could've known.
I don't know.
No, I don't.
What do you believe, Alison?
Come back!
Where are you going?
You'll freeze out there!
I'm going back there for a while.
Why?
What?
It's worthless.
Please stay.
You were right.
Mr. Solloway, thank you for coming back in.
- Did I?
- Are you fucking with me, man?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your car.
A few years.
What kind of mileage does it get?
What's wrong?
I'm yours.
Where did I find you?
I've never done that before.
No?
Hey, you ran off with my top.
It must be in the washing machine.
- Is it wet already?
Is this weird?
It's a beautiful shirt.
- Are you freaking out right now?
Here's your shirt.
When are we gonna see each other again?
I'm just worried she's in for a rude awakening.
It's... it's soft tacos?
She thinks she can get into williams because she's a legacy, but with her grades, we really would've had to donate, like, a library.
Um, did you check the dishwasher?
And where's Martin?
He's supposed to be setting the table right now.
He's washing dishes tonight.
Mommy, can I peel the garlic?
Have you been using my shampoo?
Are you gonna tell me?
I found it in the garbage.
We know you're pregnant.
I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid.
Who did this to you?
Fine.
I'll take her into Dr. Jaffey's office and she can do the DC there.
How pregnant is she?
I don't know.
Who's the boy?
She won't say.
- Yeah, of course I do.
- Do you know the password?
The one on Wall Street.
She's very proud she made an appointment at the best one in the city.
By who?
W-where?
You don't want to know.
Now, sit down.
Have you talked to your father recently?
But you haven't called him?
No, I'll call him on Christmas like I... why are you fucking bringing him up?
And then you can revisit it all again next fall.
I didn't say it was.
But you loved Helen, didn't you?
And I loved Val.
It doesn't last, buddy.
Women are like the stock market.
I got to get home.
And then he'll send you home with some vicodin and Valium, which you might not even need.
I'm sure I'll want it.
What?
Not great enough, sadly.
It's been a hard time.
I don't want this life.
I have to leave.
Leave?
We've lived together for Half our lives.
I'm in love with someone else.
Do you need some time?
I want you to get the fuck out of my house.
Was she here?
Did you fuck her in this house?
Get out.
Get out of my fucking house!
Please, get me out of here.
I know where your baby is.
__
Elizabeth recreated the potion that Adalind used on Nick.
Yeah, and in order to re-Grimm Nick, you have to, you know, do what Adalind did.
Yeah, you know, breathe in the potion, and... and what?
And make love to you.
When you do it, you won't exactly be you.
What do you mean?
The potion will transform you into... oh, God, no.
You don't mean...
How did I get here?
I told you not to wake them.
They knew where my baby was.
You heard what you want them to say.
I've checked everywhere.
I promise.
You've got to get some sleep.
You'll feel better in the morning.
The complex nature of Adalind's spell may have unintended effects on Nick.
That's my problem, not hers.
And presumably you would know that Nick knows that it's you.
Yeah, but she wouldn't be looking like Juliette.
Just saying.
I would suggest a very dark room.
Nick, if you want to be a Grimm again, this is the only way.
If you do change your mind, do it quickly.
I won't be here much longer.
I'm gonna go to bed.
A normal life sounds really good.
What are you doing up so late, Ava?
Ava, I'm your friend.
You came looking for me, didn't you?
No, you're not really here.
You seem so nervous.
That's better.
Please, come back.
I'm only trying to help you.
Ava, stop!
Ava, calm down.
Everything okay?
Uh, sort of.
What's going on?
You don't have to leave until...
We heard about you losing your, uh, I mean, not having your... well, you know, your whole Grimm thing being kaput.
By the way, is Trubel here?
I don't mean broke up in a bad way, although it was pretty unnerving.
Anyway, I was really relieved to hear that you were a friend of Nick's, as were all my friends who were there at the wedding.
I mean, wow, I never thought I'd meet one Grimm, let alone two.
What do you need?
Uh, I'm glad you asked.
Not that that reflects on you in any negative capacity, but I have this little wesen-type problem.
You know, smooth things over, straighten things out.
See ya.
Well, who the hell is Shaw?
You know where to find this Shaw guy?
I got no idea.
Your new home must have cost a small fortune.
Thank God you had one.
Security here is far better than what I had before.
Good, because I can only save you that way once.
I know what that must've cost you.
I'm very grateful.
She decapitated a Hundjager.
You think she knew that?
It would explain why she's staying with Nick.
I do, but it won't do any good.
No one knows where she is.
Tell me who has her.
Kelly Burkhardt, Nick's mother.
You know I'm going to find her.
I know you're gonna try.
Let me look at you.
I need to make sure you're okay, that there's no lingering effects from what I've done.
God, I'm good.
That's gonna open up a big can of wesen.
What am I supposed to tell him?
That I used to be a Grimm, but I'm not anymore because I slept with a hexenbiest who changed into Juliette because we took her baby away and gave it to my mom?
Wrong place, wrong time.
Happened earlier this morning, so the street was deserted.
Stop!
Where's my baby?
Calm down, Joe.
I mean, well, not in so many words.
I was at the bar telling my buddy Wayne the rumor that's been going on around the lodge.
Where do we find Shaw?
Griffin and Burkhardt, Portland PD.
You Ava Diaz's husband?
I'm sorry, she can't talk right now.
They had to sedate her when she found out the man she hit died.
One of our officers reported to us that your wife said that she was being chased by a wolf.
My wife was diagnosed with severe mental illness about six months ago.
Last night, she had a psychotic episode.
Before I could stop her, she ran outside, got in her car.
Where were you before that?
Asleep in bed.
Was your wife drinking last night?
We're gonna need to take a look around your house.
I don't want to leave Ava alone unless you need me to come with you.
Yeah, we do.
I was upstairs asleep in the bedroom when I heard a glass break.
I realized she wasn't in the bed, and I came downstairs as fast as I could.
Looks like blood.
When I came in, she was gone, and then I heard the car outside.
Your wife has seen this wolf before?
He says he's trying to help her, but she's terrified.
When did she first tell you about the wolf?
Ava was born here, but she traveled a lot to Brazil on business.
What kind of business?
Import/export started by her grandfather.
We met through a charity that provides medical care to orphans.
One thing led to another, and we got married.
But after we moved here, her illness came on rapidly.
Now we're just trying to survive.
All right, we're gonna need the contact information for Ava's psychiatrist.
Let's talk to Ava's doctor, see what she thinks.
Are you Shaw?
Is that supposed to mean something?
I heard you been talking about teaching him some kind of lesson.
So Burkhardt's sending a little girl to solve his problems?
I'm gonna teach you a lesson too, soon as I'm through with this bitch.
You got a big mouth!
You're a Grimm!
That's why I wanted you to talk.
Next time, it'll be closer.
'Cause if any of your other friends get the same idea, they won't be as lucky as you.
Make sure they know it.
Should've cut off his head.
Ava came to me right after she started having psychotic episodes.
Over the last few weeks, they've become more and more frequent.
Are all the encounters the same?
Her descriptions of the wolf are consistent and detailed.
Well, if you do, I will testify that she was mentally incompetent at the time of the accident, and in my judgment, she should be institutionalized rather than incarcerated.
I asked Ava to draw the wolf, and I will present her drawings as evidence.
In any case, I recommend that she remain hospitalized until we know that she's no longer a danger to herself or others.
Okay, dad, you're home.
Oh, my God.
A woman we think is being stalked by a wesen, uh, sort of like a Blutbad.
And you can't tell her the truth, of course, because that'd sound even crazier than what she already thinks.
Are you sure the husband is the Luison?
No, and there's no way I can find out.
And if we don't find out, there's nothing we can do for her.
Want me to come with you guys, 'cause... no, we should talk to her first.
Ava, these are the Detectives I told you about.
We have a few questions.
I don't even remember hitting that poor man.
Dr. burn said she talked to you about what I see.
Gabriel tried to stop me, but the wolf was in the car, and I had to get away.
So one moment the wolf was in your house, next thing he was in your car?
He's everywhere.
I can't get away from him.
He pretends to be kind, but I know he's lying.
Everyone tells me that the wolf isn't real, that he's all in my head, but he's real to me, and I know he's trying to kill me, and I know he will.
I am not going to let that happen.
I think this is enough for now.
Thank you.
Gabriel's records claim he has a medical degree from the university of Sao Paulo, ran a private practice in Rio for 15 years, and got his green card when he married Ava eight months ago.
He has no criminal record in Brazil, at least not one that we've been able to find.
I don't have an exact figure, but it's worth about 50 mil.
So either he's innocent, or he's working with somebody.
There's a hearing tomorrow to determine whether Gabriel gets control of her estate.
Well, she's a Grimm, right?
She cut off Weston Stewart's head with a machete, and according to sergeant Wu, she didn't seem too bothered by it.
I'm trying not to involve her too much in what we do.
You know, one of these days you're gonna have to make a decision, Nick, or you're gonna have to back off on these investigations.
Now, I personally think that would be a mistake, but I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life.
You're also gonna have to deal with sergeant Wu, 'cause I don't want him getting any closer to bringing Theresa down.
So, no pressure there.
We're gonna have to deal with Wu whether you're in or out.
Well, maybe they're looking for the key.
Nick, this is a nightmare.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't go back to your house.
My car's parked at the house.
I told you not to go back.
Whatever you do, don't stop when you enter this room.
But how do I get into this door?
There's nowhere to open it.
What do you mean, "you're the key"?
Mama.
Diana?
It'd be better if you could get into the house when he's at the hearing.
It should be easy enough to tell if the Luison's been there or not.
- We good?
I am looking at Gabriel right now.
I am looking right at him.
I don't know what to tell you, man, that's the guy I saw.
Of course... twins!
We're still waiting on records from the Brazilian federal police, but now that we know how they're doing it, how do we explain it to Ava or anyone else for that matter?
Or kill herself.
You're safe.
Luison.
Matheus!
I am not an idiot.
Gabriel?
Gabriel, where did you go?
Gabriel, where are you?
Ava, where are you?
It's not an exact match, but it's close enough.
We had to go to, what, three different stores?
Yes, you do.
You're a Luison, your brothers are in the garage, and this is so against the wesen council.
You cannot prove anything.
Oh, I think we can.
Some people hide it well.
Well, I don't have the damn key, you do.
Yeah, well, I'm glad they don't know that.
This Grimm thing is ruining my life.
You need to find some place safe and stay there.
Well, where the hell is that?
What do you want from me?
I want the same thing you want.
To get our child back.
Yeah, well, the spell of a hexenbiest does tend to put a damper on the good times.
Are you serious?
And I'm pissed that it was taken away from me.
I just wanted to say thank you to Monroe and Rosalee for putting aside their honeymoon.
Why?
It's because we got married.
You need to be a Grimm again.
A very sophisticated explosive device...
Me?
I got Lincoln Dittmann here, boss.
What's the matter?
You all look like your d-dog died or something.
Some kind of problem?
I came here 'cause I heard you were the ones who blew up that federal building in Wichita, but all I've seen so far is a bunch of wannabes who don't want to do anything real.
That's right.
He's ready to start a fire that's gonna burn down the so-called government.
Well... all I can say is, what took him so long?
I mean, that's all I've been waiting for since I got here, the chance to blow some shit up.
Even die?
I worked c-construction for 15 years.
Then they gave my job to some wetback.
My wife left me, took my daughter with her.
I ain't got nothing to lose.
It means the Founding Father wants to meet you.
Well, when?
Tomorrow.
What the hell?
I'd have appreciated a heads-up the ATF was coming.
I didn't know.
I have no idea why they're here.
And he's with me.
Foxtrot-Echo-Zulu cleared, sir.
We came here to serve a warrant to seize illegal firearms.
So, who are you?
Martin Odum.
Call it in.
Hey, kid.
Dad!
I didn't know you were coming.
I missed you.
And, Dad, I can do this trick with the ball where I can, like, flip it.
I mean, I can almost do it, but I just need to work on it.
Yeah, I saw you.
Hey, I, uh... just brought around your check.
- That's okay, Aiden.
I can't stay.
You can't just pop back up after months of being gone and expect everything to be the same.
- They're not.
Martin, you signed the check Lincoln Dittmann?
What?
You signed the check Lincoln Dittmann.
Streeter reached out to me this morning.
The Citizens' Army is back in business.
Sit-down for what?
I'll make the arrangements.
Lincoln Dittmann's still in play.
He wants Lincoln to meet him at a strip club outside O'Hare tomorrow afternoon.
Sir, that mess in Virginia happened because Martin refused to loop us in.
Nothing from you in six months, not a word.
Then I get a call that you crash an ATF weapons bust, and I'm still cleaning up after you.
Martin, can you give us a moment, please?
Excuse me.
You're acting like we got a choice in this.
He's got some kind of personality disorder.
Three out of four shrinks on the committee found him unfit for duty.
What did the fourth shrink say?
Crystal, we're talking about an imminent attack on U.S. soil.
Now, I know we're taking a risk in reactivating him, but I'm more concerned about the risk if we don't.
How long do you plan on being pissed off at me?
I run Field Ops.
One of my people goes off the grid, it makes me look bad.
I didn't mean to undermine your authority.
What did you think would happen when you went AWOL?
I'm sorry.
Don't flatter yourself, Martin.
Today... true patriots fought back against the so-called president, who is a puppet for international bankers...
We don't even know who he is, except that he calls himself the Founding Father.
He's the most dangerous domestic terrorist in the country.
And now he's gonna try to top himself.
Except that we're no closer to finding him now than we were three years ago.
Well, it sounds like Odum got close.
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.
Don't let me stop you, Buchanan.
I'm done.
Martin, this is Maggie Harris.
She joined the team last month to help out Bobby with analytics and field support.
We actually have something in common.
Lots to cover, let's get started.
Russell Stillman, former member of the Aryan Brotherhood, until he found God.
Tossed by the 82nd Airborne for striking his superior officer.
If you're meeting Streeter tomorrow, we don't have a lot of time to work out tac support.
Then start sharing, because you're not flying solo anymore.
- Children?
- A daughter.
He's got a persecution complex and a... stutter.
As his savings dried up, his writing grew more strident.
It's not fair.
I did everything right.
Learned a trade, worked hard.
I deserve... b-better...
What?
You stuttered and your accent changed.
You didn't notice?
Go home.
We'll backfill the legend.
I'm trying to help you.
What the hell are you talking about?
You don't know where your life begins and your legend ends.
Who are you?
I don't know.
Who are you?
Who do you think you are?
You really think you're Martin Odum?
There is no Martin Odum.
Trying to give yourself a heart attack?
I hate the gym.
Need a favor, Bobby.
Well, technically, you outrank me, so you can just order me to do that.
This is off book.
I'm hoping you can clean this up enough to make an ID.
It's from a subway security camera.
What's this about?
Okay, stop it there.
I'll run it through facial recognition and get back to you when I have something.
Thanks, Bobby.
The Chicago field office is prepped for your arrival.
Just make sure you stay in contact.
Lincoln's debit card, ID, cell phone, picture of his daughter.
Streeter sent a plane ticket to Dittmann's P.O. box in Phoenix.
Well, hopefully the Founding Father will be, too.
A lifeline.
Flight 425 to Savannah, final boarding.
I'll be... right out.
Streeter and Rand are approaching now.
Give Rand the car keys.
The Founding Father?
He's really gonna meet us here?
Stop asking so many damn questions.
- I don't know if this is a problem, but just in case it's a problem...
Crystal, we may have a situation here.
Stillman hasn't checked in.
If he's not there, find him.
Data can be planted... records manipulated.
People... people always tell the truth in the end.
Our people checked Stillman's motel room, and there's evidence of a struggle.
Okay, if they break Stillman, Martin's dead.
He has to know that he may have been compromised.
Crystal, what are you doing?
Isn't she supposed to c-call?
Which one of you wants to help the economy with a private dance?
I'm Star.
TLC... tatas,
Go get her.
Did it ever occur to you that Crystal is a cool stripper's name?
I'll be sure to tell my mother that you said so.
Russell Stillman never checked in with Maggie.
You'd better go.
Tell them to get moving.
Move it, dead man.
Founding Father still has some doubts about you, Lincoln, and Russell... well, he didn't live long enough to put them to rest.
Hey, you owe me 50 bucks!
I'm already d-dead.
Know what?
Follow team's still two minutes out.
Streeter?
Dittmann says he's dying of cancer.
Ask him where he was diagnosed.
Where were you diagnosed?
Chemo and radiation non-responsive after three rounds of doxorubicin, and another three of methotrexate?
Beautiful.
Doctor's name?
No records for a Lincoln Dittmann at that hospital.
Are you sure he's spelling it right?
Stand down, Streeter.
You checked out.
What about her?
Let's go.
I'm clear.
Call Gates.
Financial ministers from the G7 will be at the IMF summit tonight.
There's a whole media event planned at the Willis Tower to announce the economic cooperation agreement.
It's not just a symbolic target.
10,000 people work there.
We'll work up a threat assessment and alert all relevant law enforcement agencies.
I want everyone here on standby for when Streeter calls Dittmann.
Everyone.
Well, what's going on?
I wanted to tell you in person.
Chicago PD found Russell's body in a vacant lot near the river.
It looks like he was tortured.
Oh, we should do something for his family.
He risked his life for me.
You saved the operation today.
All right, it's not how I would've done it, but... you kept your composure, you preserved your cover.
You have no idea.
I have to take this.
Hello, th-th-this is Lincoln.
No, I'm alone.
You-you got it.
I meet the Founding Father tonight.
As we reported earlier, the treasury secretary has been in negotiations all day with finance ministers from the G7 member nations and the heads of major banks from around the world.
I'll make a note of that.
Everything that went bad was all my f-f-f...
First rule of undercover... make the lie as close as possible to the truth.
The only place that's listed here is an auto repair shop.
All set.
Guess how much.
"All talk, no action," huh?
I see t-two hats.
Sorry about Russell, but we couldn't take any chances.
Sometimes a good soldier has to fall for a good cause.
Alpha and Delta Team standing by.
Waiting to confirm target.
The police staging area is right here, next to where the bankers and their puppets are selling out this country.
Except I di-didn't see a detonator in the car.
I've got it.
So... so you're not going in with me.
Listen to me.
We've all got our parts to play, right?
I'm your Founding Father.
Alpha, Delta, target is confirmed.
I'm picking up radio communication just outside this building.
You stand down or I swear I'll take us all out.
Go ahead.
Do it.
That's right.
You wanted me to do it.
Where are you going?
You don't know where your life begins and your legend ends.
There is no Martin Odum!
Bring it on, bitch.
I'm really sorry about your C.I.
Thanks for backing me up.
That's what Bobby said.
Where is Bobby?
You really think you're Martin Odum?
There is no Martin Odum!
I need a favor, Bobby.
I'm hoping you can clean this up enough to make an ID.
Trust no one!
Tell me what happened!
They don't want you to know the truth.
They don't want you to know who you are.
Who doesn't?
There's a book, left pocket.
The answer's in there.
I don't know.
Who am I?
Welcome to Mount Weather.
We have to get them out.
I found you.
Sure, if we can get past the Reapers and the Mountain Men.
I swear to God, if your mom doesn't sanction a mission soon, I'm going by myself.
You won't be by yourself.
Guess the inquisition's over.
How's Finn doing, anyway?
I haven't talked to him since we got back.
I don't know what to say.
He just kept shooting.
We're at war, Clarke.
Next round's on me.
We did what we had to do.
I got to go.
Trouble in paradise?
Just because they pardoned you doesn't mean I have.
I know why we haven't heard from any of the other Ark stations.
Mount Weather's jamming us.
Show me.
I tweaked the resonator and got this.
It's also why the range in our walkies sucks.
It's the same signal Monty heard on the black box of the exodus ship.
Mount Weather crashed the exodus ship.
No one is going anywhere.
You and your friends are not soldiers, and continuing to act like you are puts lives at risk.
You don't understand.
Mom, we're already fighting one.
Or maybe he's dead, and they're massing against us as we speak.
Maybe... which is why we need more guards.
Sir, it's been 3 days and Maya's numbers are still climbing.
It's too soon to be sure, but I believe she may actually be metabolizing radiation on her own now.
Jasper's blood was 8 times more effective than any outsider we've ever measured.
I'm still running tests, but his system appears to have jump-started hers.
You're saying that it's a permanent solution?
Every day, you paint the outside, and if Dr. Tsing is right about this, then you might be able to see it again, dad.
Where are you going?
Then we'll have to do it anyway.
I can't believe they let Finn come.
He's the best tracker we've got.
You were right to have me bring them.
I know you're worried about Finn.
Thank you for voting to clear him.
Kane, stop.
If they wanted to kill us, they would have done it already.
This... this is not how our story ends, Marcus.
We wind up in the same train station on the ground just to die in it?
We still got work to do.
You speak of peace while you send an assassin into one of my villages.
What are you talking about?
One of you will die here, today, by the other's hand.
I will hear the terms of your surrender from the man who lives.
_
They want us to turn on each other.
They want justice.
Lives have been lost on both sides.
That's why we need to end this war!
What's your name?
Lexa.
I'm Thelonious... and this is Marcus.
Your commander spoke of an assassin in a village?
We have nothing to do with that.
It doesn't matter.
The commander thinks you did.
One of you must pick up the knife.
That is our way.
And if we refuse?
Then the commander will use it to slit both of your throats.
I'd hoped to catch you before you were discharged.
I see I'm not the only one impressed by your courage.
Oh, I just did what anyone would do.
Mount Weather wasn't built to last this long.
Over time, trace amounts of radiation seep inside.
The breach in the dorm is an extreme example.
We have methods for dealing with this, but frankly, those methods pale compared to what we saw with you and Maya.
Of course not, but if you could inspire your friends to follow your example, imagine the difference you could make here.
It'll be dark soon.
We're missing two.
Where the hell are they?
They went to find a way in.
You'd have to be able to look at me to do that.
I'll go get him.
It was an accident.
What was that?
I'm guessing some of them had access to the bunker.
In case you've forgotten, we're not under your command.
What are they doing?
Running.
Acid fog!
There's something in here.
You ok?
Clarke, do you read me?
- What is that?
This one's clear.
Let's go.
Where are we?
Looks like a garage.
More like a tomb.
Look, I'm sorry about your man, but we need to find an access door to Mount Weather.
Be safe.
Let's go.
I'm sure they're fine.
Everybody had tents.
So first you can't look at me, and now you're looking at me like I'm the enemy.
I'm not looking at you like that.
Well, you don't look at me the way you used to.
I've been waiting for the right moment to give you this.
It's starting to feel like that moment might not come.
I know how much it means to you.
Where did you get this?
It was around his neck.
- Dude, you puked for 3 days.
You know what?
We don't have much time, but we can talk freely here.
What the hell is going on?
I'm sorry.
She means they exposed her to radiation on purpose.
I'm betting it was to get you to agree to be her blood brother.
Everyone, but nobody talks about it.
We learn not to ask questions.
We have to get out of here.
We volunteer.
What's taking so long?
I just need to pinpoint the origin of the loop, hone in on the pure transmission.
Which means they attacked us.
Sergeant Porter?
When that fog lifts, take the tower down.
Blow the antenna, and we won't be able to do that.
Tough call.
I know what Clarke would do.
Man, I hate that sound.
Check this out.
Who's that?
Are you there?
Bell, what's that?
Reapers.
Don't.
It's Lincoln.
It's Octavia.
This has gone on long enough.
There has to be some other way to resolve this... something that we haven't thought of yet.
We can offer a trade.
Through sacrifice.
Marcus, what are you doing?
If we don't make a choice... then we'll both die.
And the killing won't end.
There's only one way out of this.
You have to kill me.
They respect strength.
You did not order the massacre.
Not that one.
Marcus, you don't need redemption.
The choice we made on the Ark was about survival.
We did what we had to so that the human race could survive.
It's the only way.
Not gonna happen.
You're a good man, Thelonious.
I told you, we didn't come all this way to die.
He's a Reaper?
How is it even possible?
He just looked right through me.
I don't know.
Take off these chains.
Thelonious, please, she's just an innocent girl.
_
_
_
You're the commander?
I've learned much about you.
It's clear your intentions are honorable.
Your desire for peace is true.
_
The massacre must be answered.
Blood must have blood.
You sure you're ready for this?
Now what?
Now we take him home.
The fog has cleared.
They were unarmed.
We have to go.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Neither do I.
What have we become?
And you're all set, Monty.
How high are you right now?
I must say I'm impressed, Jasper, and deeply grateful.
These are just the first, sir.
You just have to have a little faith in our shared humanity.
I hope they're all this compliant.
You think I'm stupid?
Tell me you weren't behind the breach that almost killed Maya.
I love you, Cage, and there's been a Wallace in this office since the bombs, but if I find out that you're lying, there won't be one after me.
Am I making myself clear?
We bought ourselves some time, but we're gonna need to recruit some of the others, only people we trust.
We don't even know if Clarke's still alive.
Bellamy and Octavia?
They know to rendezvous here.
If we took out the antenna, we wouldn't be able to do that.
What about the other Ark stations?
We're gonna get them out.
I'm sorry.
We all have battle scars, Finn.
Help!
I have a message from the commander.
Leave... or die.
We have two days.
Where is the girl who was wearing this watch?
And as we speak, they are marching on this camp.
They're not attacking yet, which means we still have time.
You ok?
Shut the gate.
You can't be out here.
What did she say?
Is there a chance for a truce?
Yes.
They want you.
If we want a truce, we have to give them Finn.
What the hell are you talking about?
That's their offer.
That's not an offer.
It's punishment.
That's insane.
If we refuse?
They attack.
Give him to the Grounders.
I promise, ok?
I'm not dying for him.
_
You've answered all of these, like, 10 times.
I have to go over this stuff.
Multitasking.
So, what do you want to do for your birthday?
That's it?
Move up to Zero-G so I don't have to spend the rest of my life trapped inside this tin can?
It's a raven.
Do you like it?
B corridor will be easier to defend if it comes to that.
I'm not gonna hide.
Right now, we have to think about keeping you safe.
Stay away from me.
Just trying to be helpful.
You were with him at the village.
I tried to stop him.
Not hard enough.
Yes, I do.
They're waiting for Finn.
You don't have much time to decide.
If you don't do this, she will kill everyone in this camp.
There has to be something else that we can offer.
Finn took 18 lives.
- How can you say that?
He massacred my village.
Some of the dead were my friends, too.
It is now.
We've all got a monster inside of us, Clarke, and we're all responsible for what it does when we let it out.
What will they do to him?
They'll take his hands.
His tongue, his eyes.
And anyone who grieves will have a turn with the knife.
At sunrise, the commander will end it with her sword.
But I've never known anyone to survive until the sword.
He killed 18, he will suffer the pain of 18 deaths.
Then we can have peace.
He was ready to throw Finn out the gate.
And you think I would let that happen?
I don't know.
I'm trying.
She's free to go.
We need to find a way out of this without fighting.
We sent 100 of them to the ground.
That was another time and another chancellor.
Bellamy told me you were here.
What are you doing?
There's nowhere to go.
I'm putting everyone in this camp in danger.
You were trying to find our people.
Trying to save us.
I was trying to save you.
Everything that's happened, everything I've done.
All that matters is that you're ok.
That you forgive me.
Say something.
Don't leave.
Please.
They're trying to scare us.
I think we should pull back and go inside the station.
What if I am?
Fake it.
Open the gate.
Where's the boy?
We're not giving him up.
We're ready to fight, if that's what it comes to.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I was afraid that I wouldn't see you again.
I had those fears myself.
It's good to see this place again.
It's safe for the moment.
Where did they keep you?
Uh, the commander's stronghold, I think.
No offense, Marcus, but I'm keeping the job until this is over.
I would advise you not to fight her on this.
You bought us time how?
I've gotten to know the commander and I believe... she'd be open to the right proposal.
What kind of proposal?
Abby, if we put him on trial, at least we will have control over the process and his treatment.
So, instead of letting the Grounders kill Finn, we would execute him ourselves?
That's a strong possibility.
You still want the job?
Step aside now.
We're all trying to find a way out of this.
They're gonna give him up.
Happy Birthday.
Did they post the scores?
Aced it.
It's the first perfect score since they've been giving the test.
So, when's your first spacewalk?
That'd be never.
Happy Birthday.
We are surrounded by Grounders.
If we split up, we take the low ground, we'll make it through.
We'll meet at the dropship.
Anyone else?
I thought we were meeting in the mess.
I thought this would be better on an empty stomach.
Do you like it?
It's a piece of tape with my name on it.
It goes with this.
I borrowed it from the maintenance bay.
There's external repairs scheduled all month.
So, you want to go for a walk?
Here we go.
Have fun.
The commander accepted this agreement?
We haven't made the proposal yet.
Your people would kill their own leader for being merciful?
For being weak.
And that's why you're all still alive.
If it were up to some at her table, you wouldn't be.
- Indra?
- She leads those voices, yes.
She's dangerous, Abby.
Maybe that will be enough.
I thought we were splitting up.
Not a chance.
You think the Grounders will just leave when they find out I'm gone?
Is this the best way to help our friends inside Mount Weather?
Where are they?
We shouldn't have split up.
Someone's coming.
What are you doing here?
I believe I was invited.
I thought we could use an extra gun.
Might be a good idea.
Finn should've been right behind you.
This is Ark Station calling birthday girl.
Are you reading, birthday girl?
Received, Ark Station.
On my way.
Closing the outer doors.
Free.
What happened?
What happened?
A Grounder hit her on the head.
Clarke, can you hear me?
Are you?
Why have you come, leader of the sky people?
We've both seen too many of our people die.
You ordered him to run, and then you came here to distract us.
You told our riders you were ready to fight.
If we don't find the boy soon, you'll get to prove that.
You kill one of ours, we kill two of yours.
That only helps the Mountain Men.
There has to be a way to end this without bloodshed.
You have courage... but courage isn't justice.
Only the boy can die for what the boy has done.
Still nothing?
Just give her a little time.
I never meant to hurt you.
I know.
Truth is, things change.
Maybe that's for the best.
Don't let me off the hook so easy.
Told you she'd be ok.
How's your head?
Awesome.
Because of me.
I'm right here.
I've killed so many people.
Finn, the things that we've done to survive... they don't define us.
We're surrounded.
I can't open the inner door!
Unh. Shut the door.
Are you ok?
Emergency support teams to airlock B-17 immediately.
We gotta get out of here.
Finn, Finn, that breach lost a lot of oxygen.
That plus an unauthorized spacewalk, it's a capital crime.
I'm still 17.
I'll go to the skybox for a couple months, then I'll get a review.
You'll get floated.
There he is.
Am I gonna get in trouble for this?
They're not moving any closer.
If we hit them now, at least we'd take them by surprise.
We don't even know how many of them are out there.
I'm not hearing any better ideas, Clarke.
We'll give them something.
All they want is Finn.
Finn wasn't the only one at the village.
What are you talking about?
You... that's why you asked me to come along.
Sick bitch.
Raven, you don't mean this.
You know what they do to people.
They want a murderer, we'll give them one.
Drop your gun.
Go to hell, Raven.
Put it down, Raven.
We're not doing this.
They've got us surrounded.
I'm with you.
May we meet again.
Be careful.
You, too.
Someone's coming.
There.
But I failed the physical.
Now, get moving.
We're gonna get him.
We'll get in close and we'll hit them hard.
Son... there's thousands of them.
Even if we could kill hundreds, they'd still wipe out this camp and your friend would still die.
We have to try.
No, Raven.
Take this.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna talk to the commander.
If she won't let him go, kill her.
Things'll go crazy, and we'll grab you and Finn.
I owe him my life.
What is she doing?
I'm here to talk to your commander.
Let me through.
Let her pass.
Show my people how powerful you are.
Show them you can be merciful.
Show them you're not a savage.
We are what we are.
Then I'm a killer.
I burned 300 of your people.
I slit a man's throat and watched him die.
I'm soaked in Grounder blood.
Take me.
He did it for me.
Then he dies for you.
Can I say good-bye?
What is she doing?
I love you, too.
I'm scared.
You're gonna be ok.
You're ok.
Thanks, princess.
- Okay, how much?
- Do you think he's anemic?
- No, the blood work was normal.
I had a fling this summer.
It is a destructive thing for a waitress!
You just see me as potential unfulfilled.
You ever ask her how she found out, huh?
Anybody?
Uh, it's in the script, Mr. Solloway.
I know it is, Cherise, but until the morning after their wedding, Romeo and Juliet is a comedy in the classic sense of the form.
So why do you think Shakespeare chose to change it up?
'Cause he's soft. [Laughter]
Maybe they're just too happy.
- Yeah, the nurse.
- Yeah, and that freaky dude...
The friar.
But when the adults interfere, even though they're trying to help, which both the nurse and the friar are, they end up corrupting this perfect love.
So what Shakespeare's trying to say is that pure love cannot sustain in an imperfect world.
Okay, Act III, Scene 4.
Oh, wait a second.
What's that?
- Did you know?
Wow, what's that for?
- I think you should return it.
What are you in the mood for?
Fantastic.
You want to tell me what happened this semester?
Come on, you got a... you got a B-minus in algebra.
You used to do algebra for fun two years ago.
So... move nearer the front of the class.
[Sighs] Okay, well... why don't you go find Mr. Reiner after school, and ask him for some extra help?
Okay, sure.
Who's "they?"
M-Maybe I should just go to private school next semester, with Whitney.
Do you really want to do that?
Look, I-I know it gets a little tough, okay, but... you're getting a real life education there, not some private school fish bowl bullshit.
Just give it one more semester, okay?
- She's throwing up.
Well, then what's she got to throw up?
Is it my fault?
I hope she's happy paying for Whitney's fucking therapy, and I just found out she's not even coming this weekend.
And you have lost the right to say that to me.
You know, we used to be a team.
We still are.
No, now we're just two idiots that don't know how to handle anything.
So don't go.
You're not responsible for the problems in your parents' marriage, Helen.
I understand that, Dr. Gunderson, it's just that... somebody needs to be there if my mom's not gonna go.
I'll go.
No, not necessarily.
Because you loved me?
Safe.
[Sighs] And I chose you.
And I knew you were never gonna be president or famous or rich, but I didn't care about that, because I had a rich, famous father and he was such a fucking asshole, and you adored me.
Do you think any of this is news to me?
Helen, I have been going over and over this in my mind for four months now.
The French ones, yeah.
- You know, that doesn't make me feel better!
I've taken all your fury.
I walk out of here every Friday with my fucking underwear on my head.
All I want is move on.
Let me do this for you.
Well, it's not the Pulitzer, but I suppose it's something.
- Fancy meeting you here.
I-I can't.
Ah, come on, it'll put hair on your chest.
So, was that her?
So... was that her?
Well, it's been invigorating talking to you, Bruce, as usual.
How's your book coming?
- It's fine.
Seems to me this girl might have been your muse, and now that she's gone, you're afraid of the page.
You got to harness that disappointment, son.
If you know how to use it, you might actually produce something worth reading this time.
Why do you have to be such a dick all the time, Bruce?
We were living in Greenwich at the time, and Margaret had erected this tree.
And I looked up at the tree, and I thought about what my tree would be like with this girl.
I imagined some sad, little potted thing in her tiny apartment.
I thought about my little Helen coming to visit, sleeping in the closet without any of her toys, and I knew right then, I would never go through with it.
Instead, I channeled it all into my next book.
First time I was short-listed for the Pulitzer.
The only time.
Send me something, anything.
Which hospital?
My grandmother had a heart attack.
I'll give you a lift.
I need to get my coat.
Will you come in with me?
Won't your husband be there?
No, I haven't told him.
It's not my place.
Well, thanks for the lift.
It's great seeing you again.
Every fucking day.
What?
Yes, you can.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to present to you tonight, author of the best-selling novel Descent, which will soon to be made into a major motion picture...
Thank you, it's an honor to be reading here tonight.
As I used to say as a teenager, I can't promise this will be any good, but it will be quick.
- Is it Christmas already?
Garbage.
Your old records.
How can you tell?
We need somebody who understands the property, somebody who can market it.
I don't know, sometime early spring?
Before that, she backed herself into a fencepost.
And what the fuck was she even doing, running a bath before dinner?
Why?
I want you to buy something you always wanted.
I have everything I always wanted... right here.
What happened?
- They called your mother first?
- Yeah, I don't know why.
Oh, thank God you're here.
Please, let me know if I can be of any service.
Can you give us some privacy, please?
- I'll be in the cafeteria.
What did her E.K.G. show when she was admitted?
I haven't had a...
Okay, she's been in decline for a while now.
Her heart is an old heart, and we need to honor what is happening here, and make this part of her journey as peaceful as possible.
At times like these, we need to act from our higher selves.
I'm getting a cup of fucking tea.
I'm looking for it.
No, the roof on the stable is 11 years old.
Appraiser's fucking useless.
What's happening tonight?
- Bruce Butler?
Ah, the man of the hour.
Miss?
- Miss?
Have a good night.
Traitor.
It's the only thing I could find.
I haven't smoked since this summer.
No, really, I haven't.
So your family didn't come?
- Why not?
Can we not talk about my family?
You look so beautiful.
You know, things have been good between Cole and me lately.
You know, we're trying to get pregnant, actually. [Chuckles]
- That's wonderful.
Well, I guess I should go back inside before my absence is felt.
I appreciate the ride.
I can stay and drive you home later.
Do you know what it looks like to see a pit crew of Western medical professionals trying to jumpstart a heart that's done?
Cafeteria's closed.
If it's any comfort, I remember how this feels.
What if... what if someone made a mistake?
You know, people die because someone... should have known better...
But it's different.
Letting her go is an act of compassion.
Feels like hell, but... it's compassion.
Did she have friends?
If you want to plan a funeral, I understand.
You know, she'd want a service at her church, but if you want something casual after lunch...
Well, we're headed up to Rhinebeck in the morning.
You can't wait a few days?
The pathways out here are too muddled for me.
I need to be someplace I feel supported in order to even start the healing process.
I love you.
I love you too.
As you know, we had to delay this memorial service longer than we would have liked, but today, we are here and we will not dwell on tragedy.
Let us pray.
Try under cancellations.
Oh, wow, you're right.
We found a way for you to get your Grimm back.
A Grimm?
Yeah, I am.
You know I am going to find her.
If any of your other friends get the same idea, they won't be as lucky as you.
The secundum naturae ordinem wesen.
To them, intermarriage is a crime against man and nature.
Somebody get the door.
Just put it under the tree.
Ready?
Looks like an invitation to a Christmas party.
Are we going?
It's up to you.
Depends on who's throwing it.
"Dearest Rosalee"...
"He's hoping you'll say yes because it won't be much of a honeymoon without you."
Oh, yes.
That better not be... that was not an omen.
Right, of course.
No omens here.
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be just fine.
Dennis, wake up.
I think I heard something downstairs.
Dennis, there is somebody downstairs.
I told you.
Call the police.
What the hell?
Oh, my God.
This is the group that's been terrorizing Monroe and Rosalee.
Secundum naturae ordinem wesen?
That's what Rosalee said it might be.
"These brutal trials dragged on from one to three days, bereft of mercy."
Nice masks.
"They too were burned, not necessarily so much at the stake as through the stake."
I guess the inquisition made life easier for the Grimms.
Yeah, it seems like the Wesenrein didn't die out with the inquisition.
Well, it looks like somebody at the wedding told somebody who told somebody.
So you really didn't know your dad was a Grimm when you were growing up?
He tried to tell me about some of this when I got older, but I'm not, you know, what he was, what Nick is again, what Trubel is.
I just thought my dad was kind of crazy and getting crazier.
At that point, you don't care if he's crazy or not.
Then, I met you guys, and I realized crazy is relative.
How do you deal with it?
And those are the ones that Nick has to deal with.
Maybe that's a dumb thing to wish for.
Nick's taking it very seriously.
I wish there was something I could do to help.
You have enough problems of your own right now.
Well, if you count having no job, no house, no car, and two Hundjagers trying to kill you, then, yeah, I guess I do.
You know, this is gonna be the first Christmas in my whole life that I won't be spending in Philadelphia.
Question is, what invaded?
Who got hurt?
Dennis Gladstone, owner of the house, got banged up pretty good.
Paramedics took him in.
No visible signs of forced entry.
So much debris and wreckage, gonna be a challenge to dust for prints.
Mrs. Gladstone, this is Detective Burkhardt and Detective Griffin.
Did you witness the attack?
No, but I heard it.
It was horrible.
When I got downstairs, whoever did this was gone.
I found Dennis on the floor.
Did anything happen before the attack?
We had a party with a lot of our friends.
Went to about 11:00, then everyone left.
We locked up and went to bed.
No, not really.
Do you know which one it was?
Um, that one.
Do you have any idea who sent the present?
No, I wasn't paying attention.
Looks like someone or something pushed itself out of the box.
Later, they hear something.
Mr. Gladstone comes downstairs, interrupts what's going on, tries to run, was attacked.
Looks like someone had time for a snack.
You can work up an appetite beating somebody up.
That looks like fruitcake.
Hmm, I didn't think anyone ate those.
Where are you going?
It's not a good idea.
But I'm a Grimm, and so is Nick.
Okay, Juliette isn't, and Hank isn't.
Okay, but things could get a little iffy, so don't get in my way.
Hey, yeah, I'll be standing right behind you.
What are we doing?
Why you got to check on him?
Stuff going on with Rosalee and Monroe.
He woged, right?
What's that?
We should go.
What is this?
You remember when bud came by and asked me to help with that bully problem at school?
Well, it was really about this guy, Shaw, a Klaustreich who was gonna do something to you 'cause he heard you weren't a Grimm anymore.
Well, he was coming up behind Trubel, and I just...
Yeah, I can meet you at the hospital.
See what you can find out from bud, but just get the names.
What are you gonna do, put out a police sketch of hairy, little beasts?
Aren't you looking for whoever was inside the costumes?
Any detail about the costume could help track them down.
Big guy on the left is big Johnson, real name Harold.
He is one badass Schakal.
I think that's the guy Josh hit in the head with a rock.
You hit big Johnson?
That's Walter Dempsey.
Don't get me started.
I think this is getting serious.
There's gonna be real, live ballerinas and fairies and dancing candy and a nutcracker that comes to life.
Honey, you're not gonna believe all the amazing things you're gonna see tonight.
First crime scene was on shaver street...
Now, that puts the center of everything right about here.
See, now, what's that in the middle?
St. Demetrios Greek orthodox church.
Uh, just got this from the sketch artist.
My mother left.
Sorry I didn't have a chance to say thank you.
- You tell her who has her?
Your mother wants to know where mine is.
Yeah, she brought up that subject.
Have you heard from her?
And I don't want my mother to kill your mother.
Well, if we can't warn yours and we can't dissuade mine, then we're gonna have to figure out another way to deal with all this.
It's not gonna make it any easier to find them.
Let's hope not.
Have you given any thought to how you want to handle sergeant Wu?
If he hadn't found that book, he wouldn't be paying any attention to her.
Well, he did find that book, and he is paying attention to her and to you.
What do you want me to do?
Right now, I don't want him discovering anything about me.
What the hell are they?
No idea.
One on the roof.
Easy, easy.
Guess you don't need to be a Grimm to see it.
Is it wesen?
I don't know if it's woged or what.
Well, if it's not wesen, what the hell is it?
Well, we'd better take it somewhere before somebody sees it.
Okay, we'll take it to Monroe and Rosalee's.
They can help us figure out what it is.
And animal sedatives.
Now, we don't know what this thing is, so be careful.
Me neither.
I'll be all right.
Something about 4 feet tall, hairy, smelly, and hates Christmas.
That narrows it down, sort of, and I can tell you, from the odoriferous evidence, it is not upine, canine, feline, vulpine, or bovine.
We're talking Mediterranean?
Yeah, looks like them.
Huh, well, I hope it's been translated.
I... that's, I think, what they're called.
Why do I know that?
Yeah, I mean, I wonder if it's triggered by the days getting shorter, you know, like Krampus.
Are you telling me it's all about raging hormones?
I... you know, it's either this or acne with them, I guess.
"King Augustus, however, had found the answer for me.
It stood 7 cubits high and weighed 6 stone."
Wow, that's like an 84-pound cake.
And that train is just the cutest thing I've ever seen.
Actually, it's a prewar 1935 Marklin, which survived the war by being buried in the backyard of Monroe's grandfather's house in the black forest, just outside Offenburg.
That's what happens when you're married to Monroe.
I feel like the kid I never was.
Oh, that doesn't feel good.
What's wrong?
It'll pass.
Okay, it's going away.
Have you tested yourself?
Run!
No, don't let him near the Marklin!
No, no, you don't.
Crap.
Get 'em!
How'd they get here?
Monroe, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, by the time we got to the garage, they were already out.
We didn't know they would find each other.
Ah, but you saved the Marklin.
Did you figure out what it was?
Yeah, a "Kallikarkazoi."
Yeah, it's some sort of, like, rare, seasonal, hormonal disorder that apparently only affects certain children of the Indole gentile.
They're Italian?
Yeah, we got to figure out where they're gonna strike next.
Even if we do, how do we stop them?
Fruitcake.
Dempsey's a Hasslich, right?
Right, Dempsey knows Shaw through Johnson.
All these guys were at Shaw's house today.
You went to Shaw's house?
Yeah, you said you wanted names, so I got bud, and we went over there.
Yeah, there was a lot going on there.
Okay, this is what we got so far.
Harold Johnson... that's the one we took the mask from.
You think all of these guys have something to do with what's been happening with Monroe and Rosalee?
That's what we're thinking.
I can fix them with a little glue.
What's this?
None of our decorations have asthma.
There were at least five guys at Shaw's house the first time, and most of those same guys showed up later.
If all those guys were part of that group, what if they're planning on doing something else?
Yeah, well, I try to use the law at first when I can.
- Hey, you want coffee?
Hey, Nick, you said you thought the guys who were in my dad's house were "Hungjagers."
Look, I think I'm gonna have to go back home and deal with this however I can, but is there any way that I can learn more about this stuff before I go?
Yeah, I think there is.
You cool with that?
If you are.
Is there a name on the medical bracelet?
Wow, this place is incredible.
Hey, wait till you see this.
Wait, you use all these?
This is just like all the stuff my dad used to have in his basement.
Everything that was your dad's is here now.
Do you think I'll ever become like you and Nick?
I don't know.
Let's hope for the best.
Whatever that is.
Is this his?
That makes sense.
What am I supposed to do, just go on the run for the rest of my life just because they think I have one of those keys?
Look, I was on the run for years.
It didn't do me any good until I stopped running.
You might have to stop running.
I know it's possible, but it's rare, like tay-Sachs disease in the Jewish population or sickle cell anemia in African-Americans.
Only a very small population of Indole gentile of Greek heritage are even susceptible.
- He's home every night.
Where is John now?
The St. Demetrios here?
The Christmas concert and tree lighting at the church.
Thank you.
No, but we know where he is, and if we find him, we'll find the others.
What can we do?
We're gonna need a trap.
We just... we just tell them we needed to be able to find our way back to the church.
Everyone, back!
Okay, now.
How much longer do we have to wait?
It's been quiet for quite a while now.
Oh, you're not going to arrest them, are you?
They look so innocent.
You saved some of that?
It's not as bad as its reputation.
As soon as we've got anything, we'll let you know.
You know, if you're not gonna eat that... it's all yours.
You are up awfully early.
I wanted to get an early start.
You going somewhere?
Nick, I can't thank you enough.
You saved my life.
You're a Grimm again, and things are sort of back to normal, and you don't need me as much as you did.
I don't trust them, and I don't think it's right for me.
Just let me finish, or I might not make it.
I don't think we should let him do that by himself.
But, um, I can't, you know, say good-bye to everybody.
Monroe and Rosalee and Hank...
But especially Juliette.
We're not going anywhere, and I think you should do whatever you want to do.
And, you know, you can always come back.
We'll figure it out.
I think I have something that might help.
This was my aunt Marie's.
This is what she brought the trailer here with.
I didn't want to sell it, but this seems like a good way for it to move on.
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Nick, you gave me my life.
We are being watched.
The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I'm going in alone.
Academy exercise terminated.
Sounds like you're enjoying your temporary assignment as a weapons and tactics instructor, Mr. Reese.
I'm lucky the academy was a bit shorthanded.
And our new number?
I'd call her unconventional.
Sounds like someone I know.
Why don't you try pulling your own weight, Dutch boy?
Police are supposed to enforce the rules, not break them.
Well, maybe I'm not done breaking things.
Next time's real weapons with live rounds.
Be a shame if there was a training accident.
As if law enforcement wasn't already dangerous enough.
I just finished teaching a class on the importance of mental health to some new recruits.
Well, given the ongoing IA investigation and your recent firing of a weapon inside a police precinct, figured it couldn't hurt to get you reacquainted with the rules.
We making progress on the excessive force front?
Bright and early, Doc.
Do you still have eyes on our number, Mr. Reese?
Yes, and we're about to get ears.
Sounds like Detective Fusco's going to have to pick up an extra shift.
Samaritan has uncovered evidence that an ISA agent allowed members of a criminal outfit to escape with our virus.
Escape from surveillance?
One of them has proven to be particularly elusive, avoiding cameras and detection.
Makes me wonder if it might be related to our underground friends.
Of course, you want me to track her down.
Perfect task for a former investigator for The Hague, don't you think?
No matter who they become or where they hide, there will always be the people they meet, the people they love, the people they wrong.
All of whom can be leveraged.
Good old-fashioned human intelligence.
Meanwhile, Samaritan will continue to do its part.
Our recruit's still waiting on her date.
You know, of all my confidential informants, you got the nicest wheels.
Yeah, the free eyeliner.
Well, the five-finger free.
You wear makeup?
Well, apparently, she's not too busy to case them.
Stick to the plan.
Any updates on Silva's target, Mr. Reese?
No, but she's applying her lesson on curb searches by going through their trash.
_
Any clues on Silva's phone?
Phone numbers, email accounts, home addresses, even locker combinations.
A mole inside the academy, just when we flushed out HR.
She may be searching for recruits who can be blackmailed.
Question is, who's she working for?
You missed a good time last night.
No problem.
Sounds like Silva has an admirer.
I don't think it's mutual.
Anything on Silva's date from last night?
Shaw and Fusco followed him to the suburbs, so we're still working on it.
Deep Throat's a late riser, huh?
If he takes any longer, I'm gonna ruin this upholstered leather.
Should we follow him?
I put a tracker on that clunker.
Plus, I'm betting there's more secrets inside the house.
You got ten minutes.
How did you come to work for Tomas' crew?
Attorney-client privilege, and I checked the observation room just in case.
Rest assured, no one's watching.
At the end of the day, it's all about relationships.
No names, not even to lawyers.
And what does any of this have to do with my drug case?
Who recommended you to Tomas' crew, and who recommended your replacement?
You're fired.
We weren't done talking.
There's a guy.
His name's Romeo.
Unfortunately, it's not a good time.
Would you rather I pull my endorsement of your instructor position?
We can start where we left off, your hero complex, which men often develop in response to being bullied as a child.
What just happened?
And our undercover cop's just been outed.
I know you're a cop.
Yes, I'm a cop.
Just don't get kneecapped like you did in training.
This place used to be a dump.
Someone gave it a fresh coat.
_
_
We have history.
Why would they do that?
Gang money winning the local hearts and minds.
Yeah, but knowing Dominic, it's the Pablo Escobar version.
If he can't win the former, he'll just put two in the latter.
How's it going out there?
Boys seeing the light.
Coming over from all them other gangs, just like them Trinitarios.
They all take a knee when shown the green.
Elias.
He's got to have someone, somewhere, helping him hold it all together.
Who says we have to do the digging?
You just jeopardized six months of hard work.
Like I told all of you, we all die in the end.
Save it, miss Shaw.
Something tells me we haven't seen the last of Dominic.
Meech?
All mopped up.
But what if that tall cop keeps showing his head?
There'll always be cops, just like there'll always be gangsters.
And then there are the pawns-- chumps caught in the middle.
Yeah, one-time job, all right.
If she's still out there, I can't go back to the academy.
You just need to lay low until she's out of the picture.
Got the perfect place for you to hide.
Trinitarios have them a fort up in Spanish Harlem.
No one will look for him up there.
Time you called in sick for a few days.
All that just to steal some files off a computer?
Yeah, now he's got to live in Russia.
Gave you direct access to their computers.
You want to take down Elias, the man who took down the Five Dons, you got to play smarter.
Why do all that digging when the police already did it for us?
So what did you steal?
This right here is the keys to the castle.
We're closed.
Suppose I could make an exception.
Boss doesn't have to know.
I don't see any cameras.
I am the boss.
Little something I picked up.
You ride?
They say the first rule of any job is not to spend the money.
Your friends out shopping?
You are too pretty to be local.
I don't know how you found me, but if you think I'm giving up any of my boys--
Don't care about your nickel-and-dime pals, except one.
Your former driver.
So then tell me, Romeo, who are you trying to alert?
Cell phone jammer. _
Let's just get to the point.
We keep things compartmentalized for a reason.
Deceased is Detective Howard, Internal Affairs.
Took two to the back from this baby.
Looks familiar.
Guessing our victim met his CIs here but no sign of break-in.
You can't.
Not only is your only connection to the NYPD gone, but you've been framed.
No one else knows you're Internal Affairs?
Once you're in, it's either knocked up or locked up.
Got to like judges who give second chances.
There was an anonymous cash deposit into your savings account yesterday.
He offered to clean it for me.
I'm gonna find Ortiz, and I'm gonna bring his ass in 'cause that's the only way that I can prove my innocence.
Hang on a second.
I'll check with RTCC, see if they can find him.
I suppose I am an RTCC of sorts.
During the time that Ortiz was in that office, someone logged on to the Commandant's computer using a brute force password cracker.
Where's Ortiz now?
The RTCC worked fast.
I'll head back to the Eighth and check for updates.
Let's not forget who shot who in training.
She's got a point.
Being undercover, the days turn into months.
Tell me about it.
Takes self-reliance.
Well, you got a new friend on the force.
I knew a cop like you once.
She stood up to corruption.
Gave her life to do what was right.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Were you a part of the HR takedown?
I worked undercover with Narcotics when all that went down.
I saw that in your IA file.
There's nothing in there about a military background.
And I'd swear by the tactics you teach you were in the service.
First tactics instructor was a Gulf War veteran.
Must be where I learned it.
Well, we're gonna need military tactics where we're going.
It's going to be 2 against 2,000.
It is, which is why I brought modifications.
The shirt from Ortiz's locker.
Find our mole, boy.
Welcome to mi casa.
You police?
Still in the academy.
So Dominic's got one on the inside, huh?
I never finished high school myself.
So you finished your one job with The Brotherhood, huh?
Yeah, but the thing is, we're a part of The Brotherhood now.
Don't do it, Ortiz.
An elite defense attorney got him exonerated for a recent drug charge.
The uncle was Dominic's leverage.
Where I'm from, you only got two bad choices.
Well, you still have two bad choices, but only one ends with you bleeding out.
It was only supposed to be one job.
With The Brotherhood, it's never just one job.
We need to move now.
Well, that looks dangerous.
Let's go, kid.
Your mole won't be too hard to break.
Want to teach me some interrogation tricks?
But I'll save 'em.
Including the possibility that the big, quiet kid in the back of the class, the one that everyone always underestimated, could one day run the streets of New York.
Our circles keep overlapping.
Why are you worried about a stupid cop when you got us Trinitarios on board now?
This ain't about numbers or corner boys or turf.
This here is about cutting down the old lion and ruling his kingdom.
But that can't happen if guys don't follow orders.
Guys like that... don't have a place.
You might want to rethink that.
Not like you walked in here with numbers.
I just told you, this ain't about numbers.
We all die in the end.
Heard you helped Internal Affairs uncover a mole in the academy.
The mole confessed, cleared Silva's name, and fingered Howard's killer, but no one can find him.
About the other day, we need to talk.
What do you mean?
When the bullets started flying and you swooped in and played superhero?
So either violence follows you around, or you just have the most impeccable timing.
Either way, I'm glad you were there.
This mean you're gonna recommend closing my IA case?
Let's just say I'm looking forward to our next session.
Are these the files that Dominic stole?
Oh, that's just a small portion.
Looks like NYPD intelligence on a criminal network.
Information that it took the police years to collect, and yet Dominic steals it in less than 48 hours.
And I finally figured out the common denominator.
Which is?
Our new number.
Any insider tips on eyeliner?
You keep samples in your purse?
I won't tell if you won't.
You've got to be kidding me. _
Ex-boyfriend?
Is target present?
Visual update on target.
Yes.
But no name?
Is it wrong that I'm starting to get hungry?
...Vitamin B-12, yellow #5, carrageenen, antifreeze...
Yes, and it did confirm that all the pieces we have came from the same person.
But whoever he is, he didn't come up on any database.
All the animal predation on the right metacarpal, it's gonna be tough to separate the peri- from the postmortem trauma.
Someone left the lids of their trash cans open when it rained.
We-we don't have nearly enough information.
I'll see if there's any pattern to the dumping of the body parts.
Maybe that will help them.
You are approaching a railroad crossing and are unable to see 400 feet in one direction.
You have five seconds.
You haven't finished traffic school yet?
Yeah, I'm already on it.
Enough, enough, enough with the squint talk.
Well, that should be interesting.
Like looking for a prize at the bottom of a cereal box.
Apparently, you and I eat different kinds of cereal.
I'm putting my money on the Mafia.
Traffic school's looking pretty good right about now.
I hope so.
According to Angie's map, that is the only street left.
We're the Crash Brothers.
That's odd.
It appears these trash cans have been arranged like a...
What...?
Oh, that's definitely going viral.
Turns out they were quite helpful.
Good news.
FBI techs found more of our victim in a trash compactor in rural Maryland and in a dump just outside Roanoke.
Based on the texturing of the auricular surfaces of the ilia, the victim was in his early 50s.
Well, many people become extremely intoxicated to celebrate.
I'll keep that in mind.
The posterior plane of the thorax shows signs of animal predation.
Based on the length of these punctures, these look more like stab wounds than damage from teeth.
I'll be able to confirm that once the thorax is clean.
Look at the ulna, Mr. Bray.
Judging by the pattern of kerf and striae, the victim was likely dismembered by some type of reciprocating saw.
Well, if we can discover what kind, that may lead us to the murderer.
Is it too much to ask for a complete skull?
I mean, sometimes these murderers are so inconsiderate.
Bingo.
Why wouldn't the college file a missing persons report if one of their professors went MIA for an entire week?
According to this calendar, he started his sabbatical two weeks ago.
I'm quite used to it.
I'm sure you do, but I will be reserving judgment until I can judge your value as a colleague.
So I guess warmth isn't your thing.
I don't think they look half bad, for a guy who lived alone.
Well, these hydrangeas along the bottom, they're pink, while they should be blue.
Anybody notice anything unusual going on in the past few weeks?
I've thought about doing it a few times myself.
Who lives here with all the birdhouses?
Unfortunately, I do.
We'll need to take it into evidence.
I hope I don't regret leaving you alone.
That's exactly what my mother used to say.
Just kidding.
On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate the quality of your nursing care?
Well, that should do it, Wendell.
Your labs look good, and heart rate-- everything looks good.
But unfortunately, I still have a lot more questions to ask you for the patient satisfaction survey.
Oh, but I got another patient coming in now.
Maybe we can finish this later?
Like... over lunch?
Sure.
See you soon, then.
There is so much blood in this soil, it is teeming with blow fly maggots.
Aubrey!
There's blood in the garage.
Hey, do you think we're being tested, covering the crime scene?
I'd like to think the appropriate word is "respected," my friend.
Sounds like something's in here.
Poor thing's probably been trapped in here ever since Fairbanks died.
What, are you gonna adopt him?
Man, I wish that I could, but unfortunately, Michael Vincent is allergic.
Hey, maybe Dr. B wants him for Christine.
I believe Dr. Brennan's exact words were:
"domesticating animals is a form of enslavement."
And since I can't keep a goldfish alive...
I found a tablet in the victim's house.
I think this might explain all the screaming the Golden Girls heard.
I know professors like to torture their students, but this is unreal.
Well, what kind of experiment makes someone pretend they're being tortured?
I mean, if I could, I would change places with you in a second, but I can't.
And the people who administered the shocks, did they ever find out what they were involved in?
I'm sorry, but that information falls under doctor-patient confidentiality.
Okay, Skinner.
Now let us see how these plants absorb it.
Wait a minute.
I'm trying to extrapolate the absorption rate of the victim's blood into the hydrangea bushes.
But unless time of death was six minutes ago, my experiment is a bust.
Uh, no, that's okay.
I thought you might have time of death, so I could narrow down which photos to enhance.
Hopefully I'll get it before I run out of blood.
And if you don't like roast beef, I brought chicken salad.
And if you're a vegetarian, I brought a grilled veggie sandwich.
You really didn't have to go through all this trouble.
Being told I was cancer-free.
Only those that share a love of science and lame '80s music.
So far you're the only one.
Lucky me.
You don't know the half of it.
Thanks.
One question.
All we're missing now is a romantic '80s power ballad.
And the leg was found in an off-duty trash truck.
We must have about 70% of the body right now.
Hopefully that's enough to find cause of death.
Tearing of the tissue at the distal end of the tibia and fibula is quite prominent but dull at the proximal end.
Maybe the saw blade broke and was replaced by a new one.
Was Dr. Hodgins able to find the kind of saw that was used based on the mold you made?
The blade was much too common to point to a specific saw.
Well, according to the data, you're more than likely to.
Which is why civilized societies can become barbaric.
Germany had the most advanced public education system in the world, impressive industrial production, and yet they tried to exterminate an entire race of people.
That could mean the left ventricle was punctured.
Which would have caused him to bleed out.
There's also bone chipping on the anterior of the sternum.
Whatever penetrated his rib cage was shoved in with enough force to go through his entire torso from back to front.
I thought we didn't have names for the students who participated in the professor's experiments, only faces.
Well, that's all I needed.
I used facial recognition to cross-reference student I.D. photos and found a kid that Aubrey should talk to, this psych student named...
And he had a stay in the mental hospital?
When he dropped out of school.
"Until your experiment, I never knew what a monster I truly was.
What you've unleashed, it's your fault."
Why am I here?
Taste of his own medicine, right?
I don't think so.
So you saying you killed him?
I could have.
That's what he proved, right?
Fairbanks proved that given the right circumstances, these nice people can pick up a machete and hack someone to death.
I killed an innocent person, and I don't know how to live with that.
Well, maybe you wanted revenge.
It's okay.
It's exciting how much we have to discover about each other, isn't it?
It sure seemed like it did.
You're amazing.
I guess everything's just, you know, happening so fast.
Yeah, what the hell?
Yeah, I know, but, uh, the time and, uh, um... a nooner isn't a really good excuse for being late.
Right.
I'll call you later?
There's evidence of remodeling to the victim's lower left margin of the mandible.
Uh, and there are remodeled fractures in the lateral curvature of the sixth and seventh ribs.
Are you okay?
Just before Alex Heck was confined to a mental hospital.
Maybe he came back to finish what he started.
Um, Mr. Bray, take a look at this color variation in the inferior margin of the left side of the mandible.
I'll run a DNA test to see where the bone came from.
I thought the problem was your simulated sun needed to set?
Yes, but over days.
So, let there not be light!
And... go!
Wow, it's working!
I'll go isolate the bird cam photos from around that time and you should feed Skinner.
Yes, Mr. Bray?
I have the results of the DNA test.
The grafted bone came from a Brazilian national.
Oh, Fairbanks was hospitalized in Brazil two years ago with a broken mandible.
It was a parasailing accident.
I knew that.
Congratulations!
Murder break-- a lot better than traffic school, don't you think?
And that was around the same time that he started seeing Tabitha.
Seemed farfetched to me, too, until I found out that Victoria just moved back to the area to sell her sculptures.
And Hodgins found traces of copper, aluminum and steel in the victim's stab wounds.
You might've just found the murder weapon, my friend.
Dr. Brennan's gonna be so impressed.
I'm impressed.
And she and her team say that the metal you use matched the particulates they found in the bone.
A gift... that's conveniently disappeared.
Now, you use a, uh, Kobashi 8.9-inch saw blade on your sculptures, right?
Couldn't handle it, could you?
Not before you trashed his lab, and got booted out of school.
So, where were you on the night of the 22nd, Victoria?
Can anybody verify that?
You might want to call your attorney because, uh, things are really not looking good for you right now.
The right ulna, radius, tibia and fibula.
Not much more of him left to find.
Which is good because they won't be able to hold Victoria Andrews without more proof.
I'm in remission, everything's good.
If you need to get that....
No, I'm at work, and at work I work.
And judging by the curve and the size of the dental arcade, the bite was made by a female.
Victoria Andrews.
I'll get a warrant and pull her dental records.
So Victoria did it?
Look at the diastemata of Victoria's incisors in relation to the dental lacerations on the victim.
He does knows the pH of blood, which is impressive.
You're supposed to be a genius.
Officer Stop 'n Go is wrong.
Okay, would you like to argue with an officer?
You are at this instance.
You're not-- you're wrong.
What are you sitting here, waiting for?
She's all yours now.
I used the time of death you gave me to pull the correct footage from the bird camera.
As if I needed another reason to love you.
We've been focusing on the wrong jealous lover.
I swear, I'd never hurt Randy.
His next door neighbor said that she heard fighting a few minutes after you got to the house.
So maybe it wasn't about sex.
So she was just a grad student like you, but Fairbanks gave her credit on all the studies.
And even a nice person like you can turn violent.
Isn't that what your last behavioral study was about?
I'm waiting for the part where I believe you.
I was conducting a study of my own on Randy, to see if subconscious olfactory reminders of me would make him more attentive.
He caught me in his bedroom, and we fought, because I was conducting a study without his approval.
We fought, and I left.
And I never saw him again.
You know, you can't sleep with me and dump me all in the same day.
You just can't do it.
I'm talking about you.
There's another point?
'Cause I'm pretty sure that two people liking each other like this is what everyone is looking for everywhere in the world all the time.
And we're lucky enough to find it.
So what gives, Wendell?
What I've learned treating patients... death is just part of the deal.
You know, we all come with an expiration date.
That doesn't scare me at all.
And what makes you so sure you're gonna go before me anyway?
I had an aunt who went on a bike ride-- healthiest woman in the world.
Killed her on the spot.
You ask him if he would've been better off if they'd never gotten together.
I don't know if I can do it.
Sure you can.
Just... maybe not alone.
Is it okay if we kiss here?
Who cares?
Mr. Bray, if you'd like to keep your job...
Of course, Dr. Saroyan.
I'm almost done.
Well, it would, if I hadn't found antifreeze on the victim's right hand, which was found at a different dump site.
Are the left metacarpals ready for us?
Now you're in a rush?
Yeah, sorry about that.
Not too sorry, I imagine.
Anyway, I got some X rays over there if you want to take a look while you're waiting.
There's an abrasion on the second distal phalanx.
Actually, antifreeze tastes sweet to animals.
It's the reason so many household pets consume it and die.
Which means that someone was trying to poison Skinner.
Congratulations, driver.
Thank you!
Why are you acting like your hockey team the Finers won?
Yes, it looks like someone tried to poison the cat.
I'm sorry, are you following this?
Apparently.
I'll get her dental records and see if the bite mark is a match.
You should be pleased with yourself for picking Aubrey.
He's quite competent.
Was that just a compliment?
I tell you what, why don't you just enjoy the spotlight for now and go finish the case, huh?
I wouldn't hurt a fly.
That bite mark matches your dental records.
During the struggle you must've pushed him, causing him to stumble backward and impale himself on the garden sculpture.
And then there's this.
The saw that you used to cut him up.
The same saw you used on your birdhouses.
How could I know that he'd impale himself?
One little bell?
I was just trying to protect the Bewick's Wren.
They're so beautiful.
There's really nothing like them.
Oh, Bones, I almost forgot.
I got you a present.
Very funny.
However, unlike you, I have never received a citation for speeding.
The State of Virginia, for starters.
Okay, that's it, you're under arrest.
Stand up, turn around, hands behind the back.
Themosthighly anticipated film of 1954 had its premiere this week at the world-famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre in the heart of Hollywood.
Bones features two of Tinsel Town's most beloved stars, the beautiful and talented Emily Deschanel and the leading man's leading man, David Boreanaz.
They're celebrating their tenth film together in ten years, which means a decade of joy for America.
And here they are joining other great stars in the Hollywood galaxy as they are honored by being immortalized in cement for the hours of enjoyment they've given their fans.
Yes, it's showtime!
And Hollywood royalty files in to see this new and exciting picture.
Good luck to Emily and David, even though we know they don't need it.
Miss Braga?
Miss Braga?
Temperance Brennan, LAPD.
Miss Braga, poor Miss Braga.
I need your weapon.
I could be a great detective, Dad.
He has the lead on the Braga case.
The remains weren't even warm.
The bones weren't displaying...
Don't you dare take one of those desks.
Ditto.
It's not time to celebrate yet, Booth.
They're going to find a way to arrest you for the murder.
They've even brought in Inspector Clemens from Interpol.
Let's drink to it.
Professor Hodgins is a brilliant paleontologist.
Professor Hodgins has made amazing discoveries studying bones to determine how dinosaurs died-- why shouldn't he be able to find clues on Eva Braga's bones that could lead us to the killer?
It's similar to the damage from the lightning that struck our coelurosaurian theropod.
While you're asking them for the impossible, why don't you see if they can send a man to the Moon?
The young lady's idea is brilliant, sir.
We should be able to connect our research to your mystery.
A challenge.
Bodies are so much bulkier than jewels.
I guess you could say that science is a hobby of mine.
I like to think that it could be the key to solving crimes.
Don't you have faith in science?
I wanted to drive, and that's not working out.
Let's get these remains over to the professor, shall we?
I think we're the only two people who believe Brennan.
How come you're only a cub reporter, big boy?
Injustice, but maybe we can change that.
Little early in the day for a martini, isn't it, Vaziri?
Sort of.
Then perhaps another drink is in order.
Framed for Eva Braga's murder, we're thinking.
We thought you might know what happened to them.
If she was so rich, why would she sell her jewels?
Now, if you'd like to throw a drink in my face for that, be my guest.
Thanks, Angela.
Angela is trying to lift the carbons of the files that are coming in from Interpol.
A poorly made omelet?
Hey, when do I get to drive?
Miss Brennan's theory is brilliant.
If we look at these remains as if they were dinosaurs, then we should be able to determine what happened to this poor woman.
"Decomposing flesh."
Professor.
Interesting.
I don't believe this.
Sarge!
And you've brought an angel with you.
Temperance Brennan, this is Sarge.
Beans?
Thanks, PeeWee.
Booth, what did he do for you?
It is certainly easier to detect anomalies on new bones than on fossilized ones.
What else have you found, Watson?
With all due respect, Professor, the woman was locked in a safe with a stick of the stuff.
The concave fracturing juxtaposed with the outward bowing caused by the explosion.
Blunt force trauma, like the kind caused by the tail of an ankylosaurus.
Which could have caused enough damage to the brain to kill her.
She was killed before she was put into the safe.
I find I am quite enjoying this, Mr. Edison.
Men have been slapped for less.
And more.
You still haven't told me about Sarge.
Do you have the carbons?
All the information collected so far on Eva Braga.
No problem.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay, so, I'll get you anything else I find.
Almost?
Oh, some people deserve to be robbed, and others don't,
What did I tell you, Booth?
And if you don't want anyone to know you're a cop, you're gonna pretend you're having a good time, darling.
Well, you don't need an eagle to spot him, sugar.
Eva was paying your tab in South America, right?
And with her out of the way...
I'd never kill anyone, my dear.
If you say anything to the cops, old sport, you're toast.
Oh, Jimmy, you have the best friends.
What kind of answers?
She and Rodolfo?
I hate you.
I'm going to kill you!
I thought I was an early bird.
I think it's time you answered some questions, Booth.
No "thank you" for the coffee?
Thank you.
Are you protecting Sarge?
Is he who we're looking for?
You don't have a job anymore, remember?
But since you asked... out of uniform, Sarge wouldn't hurt a fly.
Are you having second thoughts about me?
Do you really care?
I shouldn't.
Well, then knock it back, because we've got to scram.
These are Eva Braga's clothes, taken from her closet.
Eva Braga was too large to fit into these shoes.
If this is her dress, it should fall to the middle of her tibia.
Look at the length of the femur.
She's at least four inches too tall for a dress like this.
Eva Braga doesn't seem to be able to fit into her own clothes.
Which means that this is probably not Eva Braga.
What do you mean, it's not Eva Braga?
If I had a sketch of the dead woman, maybe Aubrey could I.D. her.
She must have some connection to Braga.
Well, the professor can show what a dinosaur looked like from the bones.
Now I know why you got suspended.
They're all jealous of you.
I was hoping we could all get a drink.
They're trying to frame me for Eva Braga's murder.
The murder victim-- you recognize her?
Seriously, old sport?
Aubrey, are you okay?
You need another scotch?
A double.
Or he was looking out for his own skin because the heat was closing in.
He saw horrible things in that war.
D-Day, liberating the camps, all the friends he lost.
They'd sell to Hitler as easy as our side.
It didn't matter to them as long as they made a profit.
And gave the money to his chums who were having a rough time since they came home.
Phone call for you, Miss Brennan.
Booth couldn't have killed her.
You recognize her?
I don't know.
She was...
Pretty loose with those adjectives, you louse.
It was the maid, Booth.
Come on!
Aubrey was killed because he knew the real Eva Braga.
That's why they didn't fit.
She stole Eva's jewels, took off, posing as Eva on the boat.
So then the real Eva found out her jewels were missing, figured out the maid took them and came after her.
Because Eva Braga's family got rich during the war selling arms to Hitler on the black market.
We know you killed Eva.
That's why you're leaving.
No, I'm leaving because I no longer have an employer.
Why is everyone always surprised by that?
Move it.
Well...
- That's what Caroline told me.
Told you?
- You're just trying to save your daughter.
His daughter is brilliant, Jeeves.
I wouldn't have been able to give this beautiful artist the victim's description without his daughter's visionary help.
You really think I'm beautiful, Doc?
The Golden Ratio is hard to argue with, Miss Montenegro.
So, Inspector, you're not needed here anymore.
Are you serious?
Very serious.
Sometimes.
I said move it!
We gotta get out of here, now!
Now we're talking.
What do you have in here, a dead body?
We'll dump her over the ocean to finish her off.
That's gonna be extra.
Time to board!
Go, go, go!
Hurry!
Go, go, go!
All this dough I paid you and you couldn't get me a door that works?
I didn't know you wanted the luxury getaway package.
Oh, no, you don't!
You got your seat belt on?
Just fly this thing!
Bad move, chump.
Don't even think about it.
My jewels!
Did she...?
But you solved the case, Detective.
And now we're going to die.
Oh, no, I would never let that happen.
See?
This is why I like to drive.
Thanks for letting me drive.
Only seems fair.
Wait a second.
Darling?
Oh, Lord have mercy.
There is one more thing.
So that's 20 cargo ships in the last three months.
Whoever's behind this smuggling ring knows their way around the docks, so we're going undercover as longshoremen.
No, Vaughn did.
And I'm Twink Tucker.
You cannot choose your own name anymore.
Coffee, extra black, extra no sugar, and real warm.
It gets cold on them docks.
And one Earl Grey tea for me, Twink Tucker.
No, you ruined it.
Perp's name is Jesse Hermick.
We arrested him for nine counts of armed robbery, but he skipped bail.
He was just picked up in Neustadter, New York, trying to pay for a hoagie with a gun.
The sheriff is making us pick him up tomorrow morning at 6:30 A.M., so we're going up today and spending the night.
I'll put them in a sealed baggie.
Naturally.
Call me if you need anything.
Yes, sir, will do.
It's almost like it's haunted by fancy ghosts.
I don't mind at all.
It's actually really cute of you.
Teddy's never done anything that spontaneous or romantic.
Okay, see you in a sec.
Hi, can I speak with Detective Teddy Wells please?
Captain Holt just asked me into his office for a food-related question.
I've wanted to build a rapport with him since he got here, but until now, all we've had in common was our bank.
This is great.
I had no idea Captain Holt was interested in food.
I have zero interest in food.
If it were feasible, my diet would consist entirely of flavorless beige smoothies containing all the nutrients required by the human animal.
Could you help orient me with that process?
I'd be honored.
Preparing food for one's lover is the most intimate gift of all.
Is it typhoid?
Are you a vampire?
My horoscope said to wear a cowl-neck today, and I laughed.
This is allergies.
That perp in there has the name of a giggle pig supplier.
I leave when I get a name.
I'm gonna go to the deli anyway.
Terry loves kreplach.
So I'm gonna go unpack, and then I'm gonna take a bath, and then we have dinner, and then...
Your surprises are always terrible.
Uh, you're welcome.
Jake, I don't want to see Teddy right now.
I'm about to break up with him.
Look, what happened with you guys?
We have different interests.
It's all we talk about.
I had an airtight breakup plan in place.
I made a reservation next Thursday at a well-lit Korean restaurant in midtown.
I don't want to say the wrong thing and hurt him more than I have to.
That's why I started writing out a breakup speech, but now he's on his way, and I'm only halfway through the outline.
All right, look, this is totally my fault, so I promise, I'll do everything I can to help.
Tonight, I will focus solely on you and Teddy.
I can be very persuasive.
I don't need your help, because I am not sick.
Gina, where is the cold medicine?
I hate to point out the obvi-o-so, but why do you need the meds if you're not sick, hmm?
To fight off the cold symptoms that my healthy body is exhibiting.
Okay, if Diaz won't accept our help, we got to go behind her back.
One of them watched me bathe.
I'm Meredith.
You were just trying to do something really nice for a friend, and it blew up in your face rather spectacularly.
Oh, there's so many puppets in there.
Now, the first step in learning how to cook is learning how to taste.
So close your eyes and open your mouth.
Their components have a long shelf life, they're cost-effective, and they're so simple, a child could make them.
Okay, I was looking for more of an emotional connection.
For example, my favorite meal is a simple roast chicken and potatoes.
He's in the shower.
I said hi to him, we chatted for, like, a minute, and I almost blew it.
Oh, I'm sure you're overstating that.
All right, so after dinner, pretend you're sick and say you want to go straight to bed.
There he is!
Teddy in the house!
The radiator in our room sounds like a woman screaming.
Yeah, oh, and there was a dead crow in our toilet.
You should complain about that.
I'm gonna snuggle up next to that thing with you.
No, I don't want to do that.
'Cause of the cancer risks.
Most people don't know this, but sitting by a fire is actually worse than sucking on a tailpipe of a bus.
What's going on?
We having a good time?
We are not.
I don't want to get near her germ face.
Permission to lock her in a distant room?
Rosa, come here.
They are a highly nuanced and complicated dish.
That means the heat is a little too high on those eggs.
Well, the higher the heat, the faster the eggs cook, the sooner Kevin eats.
No, you make an excellent point, but we don't want to feed Kevin burned garbage.
Cooking is about patience.
Are you completely insane?
You know what?
You, sir, are not ready to scramble eggs.
I'm just gonna make Kevin plain toast for breakfast.
What you smell is the burning wreckage of my relationship with Holt.
So there's no corn on the cob?
The main reason you want to break up with me is the pilsners?
There are so many reasons I want to break up.
That sounded bad, didn't it?
There's just no spark between us.
Can I maybe just have two hours alone with my laptop, so I can type up a draft?
Great idea.
In the meantime, we can just chat.
No, actually, I think you should stay, so we can all talk about the real reason there's a problem in my relationship with Amy, which is you, Jake.
Buh... what now, huh?
About how you told her that you liked her before you went undercover.
Was it?
A little.
I mean, I was confused.
And I really need my laptop right now.
I'm gonna go.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, it's me.
You were a wrong door.
You were a wrong door.
That's a very angry man.
Look, I know what that sounded like at dinner, but I promise you, I am not into Amy.
I knocked on yours.
Who's Amy?
The puppets are on the bed.
Good morning, Boyle.
Oh, good morning, Captain Holt.
After our disagreement yesterday, I went online to read your culinary blogs and scoff.
To my dismay, I actually learned something about how food tells a story, so I made Kevin this.
It's warm.
It's a croque monsieur.
Kevin and I shared one on a rainy afternoon in Paris on our first anniversary.
So thank you for your guidance.
It's gross, huh?
He's a natural chef.
Now I know how Salieri felt.
Everything okay with Diaz?
Yeah, she fell asleep five minutes after I locked her in, and she hasn't moved in the past ten hours.
I'm gonna rip your head off.
I'm gonna rip your damn head off, grandma.
I already interrogated the perp for you.
It's all good.
Now go home and get better.
You literally have been in a coma since yesterday.
Now, I know you like to act like you don't need any help, but we all do.
I ask five dudes to spot me when I'm doing my squats.
Now's the time when you say "thank you for all your help."
Thank you for all your help.
Wait, is that a smile I see?
Possibly.
My immune system is too weak to fight off my smile muscles.
You okay?
We're still together.
I told her, you know, everything with me and you is in the past, and we're just friends, so...
Great.
Welcome back.
It looks like he might come out dressed and ready for school.
My doula assured me that my meditation and my breathing exercises will give me at least two more weeks.
Well, you've been through so much, losing Sweets.
Lance would want me to rejoin the world.
And the baby and I have never felt better.
When he's ready, he'll tell me how he wants his room set up.
So, you're waiting until he can talk before he has a room?
I'll get the remains set up on the platform.
No, but the protesters are accusing the fracking company, which is mere supposition.
Well, the fracking people are freaking, right?
They're putting a lot of pressure on the Bureau to get this solved quickly.
Yeah, everything that's ever been made for a baby.
We will be there for every school play, graduation and hockey game.
On my way.
Cam needs me, too.
But there's no other damage evident that would give us cause of death.
That's so nice.
I doubt that very much.
These bones are quite porous.
I've uploaded the photos of the remains from the coroner's report.
There's at least 20% more tissue on the remains in the photos.
Don't those sites use acid as part of the process?
That's what's causing the rapid tissue loss.
But the acid is still consuming the bones.
You know, I'm on it.
Maybe this is why the fracking company was trying to get in the middle of the investigation.
It's not just for cooking anymore.
I don't know what I'm gonna get from a tox screen.
Well, the porous nature of the bones and the irregular pitting on the surface indicates that the remains weren't in the pit for very long.
Well, I should be able to recreate the exact conditions to tell us how long he was in the pit.
Hey, Cam, check this thing out.
The fabric that got caught here on the cast-- it looks like it's got some blood on it.
Well, I'll try to get DNA off it so that I can ID the victim.
Thanks again, Dr. B., for sharing Christine's stuff with us.
My doula says the baby and I will be able to communicate as long as we both keep our spirits open.
Your baby will communicate when he defecates or is hungry.
And he will do so by crying, not picking out clothing.
Are you feeling okay there, Daisy?
I've never felt better.
The majority of the victim's skull exhibits the same pitting evident on the rest of the remains, except for this large section of the occipital.
So, he must have suffered some sort of head trauma in the past.
And the polymer piece was used to repair the skull.
Well, it's most likely polyetherketoneketone.
It's the most biocompatible and osteoconductive substance.
It's a very rare procedure.
Okay, so the site manager admitted that only three of the security cameras were real, and they were all covering the front entrance.
Well, that's why there's no footage of the pit the guy died in.
I mean, you'd think they'd want working security cameras with all the protesters they get.
Well, you would think, but, uh, you know, he was accused of beating up protesters before.
Thank you.
Turns out, he was in a boating accident three years ago, and his surgery made national news.
You know him?
He's the puzzle master.
His crossword puzzles are syndicated in hundreds of papers.
Maybe that's why he was killed.
He lived less than a mile from the fracking site.
The article mentions his wife, Emilia, but she never reported him missing, and she still hasn't.
Oh, you sound a little bitter about that.
I loved Lawrence, but no marriage is perfect, is it?
Which is why I'm still single.
So when was the last time you saw him?
Right before I went to the grocery store yesterday morning.
Oh, unfortunately, people have been killed for less.
But he promised to make her co-editor, so she knew that was coming eventually.
Yeah, but some people can get very impatient.
The impressions from the pen were still on the cast.
That's how I was able to recreate what was written on it.
The blood on the fabric was degraded by the acid, so I could only get a weak STR profile, but it appears to be a match for the victim.
What's all this on the cast?
They appear to be crossword puzzle clues.
Yeah, except this is not all of his handwriting.
The handwriting on these clues is different than these.
I may or may not have a... an autographed copy of one of his completed puzzles.
You really are a fan.
This is not his handwriting.
"Despise ." Hate.
This looks like some kind of a message from his killer.
Ooh, Booth said the wife told them about Brooks' assistant.
If she killed him, the clues on his cast make sense.
Yeah, great.
I want to talk about Daisy.
I think that she might be having a nervous breakdown.
Her work on the case is exemplary.
Honey, she's shopping for crystals.
She told me that her doula told her that if she found the right one, that it would channel positive energy into her womb and make the birth painless.
Well, that's foolish and ignorant, but it's not a nervous breakdown.
Is there anything I can do?
Of course.
She has a doctor's appointment this afternoon, so I'm gonna drive her.
Right.
Do you want my help finding Lawrence's killer or did you just come here to insult me?
You're a thief, Brooks!
Said he had an appointment, but there was nothing on the books.
And you think that's the same guy that left the message?
All I know is the message and the guy showed up around the same time.
I saw the same guy again yesterday in the parking lot, like some kind of stalker.
Yesterday.
So you have no way of knowing who made the call.
"Schmo." It's Yiddish for "idiot."
So I assumed you were saying we're looking for a mentally challenged, Yiddish-speaking...
Stop, okay, Bones?
The killer doesn't speak Yiddish.
How do you know?
I don't, but that's not the point.
Then why did you bring it up?
I think I might have found our guy.
Does he speak Yiddish?
What?
Since then, he's had two DUIs, a few disturbing the peace violations, a couple of assault charges...
So a farshtunken chachem.
Just bring him in, okay?
Our real challenge here is getting the acid concentration just right by getting the right piece of pork to mirror the relative mass of the actual victim.
And the solution replicates the conditions in the pit?
On to the next.
Daisy, do you really believe in all that new age stuff?
Science can only go so far, Dr. Hodgins.
You think I've changed since Lance died, don't you?
You know, that is science.
Oh, perfect.
The degree of pitting matches the victim's bones.
So, Emory, I have an eyewitness saying that you were stalking Lawrence Brooks.
If he wants me to stay away, he just has to say so.
A god to you.
I'm not some nut job.
I've been researching him for two years.
But it has absolutely nothing to do with Lawrence Brooks.
Someone threatened him?
Donald is also a puzzler.
You know, with clues like "a three-letter word for a grown kitten."
So he was jealous of his career.
It's all in my book.
You can take the manuscript if you think it'll help.
You found something, Ms. Wick?
Yes, it was.
Perhaps we can just stick to the case.
I would like that very much.
The victim has an extensive amount of remodeled fractures localized around the pelvis, ribs, ankles, and arms.
All of it occurring within the last 18 months.
What do you suppose caused these antemortem injuries?
Look at the X ray of his femoral shafts.
Thinning of the cortical bones of both femurs.
Meaning that the victim's bone density was compromised even before the acid.
That's why our 48-year-old victim has the bones of an octogenarian.
You should perform a trephine bone marrow biopsy on the posterior iliac crest, then screen for poison and other toxins.
I-I can perform the biopsy.
And this appointment, it's it's with a... real doctor?
Yes, Dr. Brennan.
I'm alone now.
It's just... me and the baby.
I have to find a way to make that work for me, to... connect to him without Lance here.
I'm doing the best I can.
Thanks so much for coming with me.
There's my budding Daisy.
Valentina, hi.
Well, everyone has to make their own choices is what I believe.
But you seem like a nice person.
I'm sure your child will be fine.
You can wait out here.
And you agreed.
All you have to do is say "suspect," Aubrey.
So I left Brooks an angry voice mail.
Last time I checked, that wasn't a crime.
Oh, it's not a crime, but killing him is.
Well, you should, because it's from the, uh, puzzle that you stole from Brooks.
You opened it!
Why did you do that?
This was my proof.
I wasn't stealing from Lawrence.
Lawrence was stealing from me.
So... the nationally syndicated puzzle master was stealing puzzles from you?
Lawrence and I used to be friends in college.
I thought maybe he could take a look at my puzzle-- it's a good one-- and consider it for publication.
But he never even acknowledged getting it.
This guy's a hack.
I was gonna take legal action.
I mailed the original puzzle to myself the same time I sent it to him.
It was proof I'd been ripped off, until your agents came along and tore it open.
Did Cam get the results back she was running on the marrow biopsy?
He definitely punched someone.
Very good, Ms. Wick.
Hold on.
The protrusions on the proximal phalanges at the metacarpophalangeal joints on his right hand are healed avulsion fractures due to hyperextension.
His fingers were bent back until they snapped.
Remodeling suggests this happened two months ago.
So his murder wasn't the first time he was assaulted.
I have the results of the tox screen of the marrow.
The victim wasn't poisoned, but he did show traces of donepezil hydrochloride.
That's used to treat Alzheimer's.
The head trauma that put him in surgery three years ago could've triggered an early onset.
I-In rare cases, a side effect of donepezil hydrochloride is reduced bone density and increased bone fracturing.
Which explains why the victim had so many remodeled injuries.
But Brooks' puzzles could stump geniuses.
So I've been looking at Lawrence Brooks fan sites.
There's a lot of chatter about how his puzzles have been different lately.
He might have been stealing more than just Donald's.
So it's likely he didn't even know he was stealing Donald's puzzle.
My grams had dementia, and her handwriting would change like she was a different person.
So why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you tell us your husband had Alzheimer's, Mrs. Brooks?
It was hard.
Horrible, sometimes.
Do you have any idea what it's like when the person you've been married to for 20 years looks at you as if you're a stranger?
And I would do anything to preserve that.
His treatment was expensive and... we were broke.
Lawrence Brooks was worth well over a million dollars.
When I asked him about it, he couldn't remember what he had done with it.
Money like that doesn't just disappear, you know?
I've been going through Brooks' bank statements.
There were e-payments made to LPAK, LLC that started five months ago.
Looks like the transfers started off small and got bigger and bigger as all the money dried up.
Well, maybe someone knew about his Alzheimer's and was using that to steal his money.
Well, it looks like it was more simple than that.
LPAK, LLC is a front for an online gambling site.
Well, most are, but some are here.
They're illegal, but they're here.
And after you sign up, if you want to stay off the grid, you can meet with the bookie in person.
So maybe because of the Alzheimer's, Brooks forgot to pay.
This time the bookie did more than just break his fingers.
I was able to track down the local bookie for the...
The hell are you doing?
I put ten grand on a horse named Major Imperative.
I'm sorry-- what the hell do you think you're doing?
You're an addict, Agent Booth, and I'm not gonna let you jeopardize your gambling sobriety on this case or any other case.
You read my file.
Yeah, 'cause I heard rumors.
Sweets was pretty thorough in his report, you know?
You gambled as a coping mechanism after your time in the military.
What do I look like, a winner?
What, having a cup of coffee is a crime now?
No, but transferring funds from a bank to an illegal online gambling site is.
In fact, that's a federal crime, which is right up my alley.
Congratulations, I'm really happy for you.
What's that got to do with me?
Oh, you're really gonna play stupid right now?
Stupid?
Okay, the fingers, yeah.
Look, I hated to do it to the old guy, but, you know, he was deep in the hole.
Maybe you should talk to that woman that he was bankrolling, because she started freaking out as soon as the money dried up.
Look, the chick that placed the bets-- well, she lost big a couple of months ago, right?
Of course I had access to Lawrence's accounts and credit cards.
So you took advantage of a man who was losing his mind in order to feed your gambling habit.
How did you figure out that Brooks had Alzheimer's?
Well, he started getting confused over the littlest things, and then... just like that, he would get agitated and lash out.
It happened often enough, it was easy to put two and two together.
Daisy, Dr. Brennan said you were having contractions?
I'm sorry, I'll clean it up.
I would recommend us being alone now, Daisy.
No external distractions.
They're not distractions, they're my friends.
A peaceful mother makes a happy baby.
Cut her some slack, Valentina.
A human being is trying to escape from her vagina.
Well, perhaps I can walk with you and you can squeeze my hand.
I did that when I was in labor and I took great comfort knowing that Booth was in pain, too.
He's the godfather.
Visualize a forest...
Very good.
Daisy...
I want shiny machines that beep, and I want the lights on!
I've got plenty to go over.
Oh, g-g-good, is that the kid's manuscript on Lawrence Brooks?
Yeah, I'm hoping there's something in here that can point us towards a suspect.
I mean, there's got to be somebody other than Donald that Brooks pissed off in the last year or two.
Great, see if anyone can place Alexis Sherman at the fracking site.
I got it covered.
Oh, thank goodness you made it.
No, no, you have to be here.
You all have to be right here.
We are not going to leave, sweetie.
Right, right, you're so right.
I'll go tell the doctor how you're doing.
What are our findings thus far?
No, Bones, this is really not the time to talk about this.
Okay, okay, okay.
We know that the cause of death is a broken neck.
Um, no defensive wounds, offensive injuries only.
As fragile as his bones were, we know there should've been something more than just a neck break.
No, no, that's how the victim's neck was broken.
It was from the killer.
The victim's parents are dead and he had no children.
Okay, who here has the balls to argue with a pregnant woman?
But I actually really need to push now.
Like really need to push.
I found it, Agent Booth.
Yeah.
Yeah, everything is... is going good.
Listen, just, you know what, get a warrant so you can unseal the adoption records.
So, writing the book was a way to get to know Brooks.
He was all I had left.
I never meant to hurt him.
Well, then, what happened?
I finally found the courage to call, and I told him I was his son.
And he actually seemed happy to hear from me.
So we agreed to meet at a café down the street from his house.
How did you get from a café to a fracking site?
He never showed up to the café.
I waited over an hour.
But Brooks had no idea who you were.
He wouldn't even acknowledge that we had spoke.
I was hurt.
We're flesh and blood, so I asked him why he was messing with me, and he freaked.
He started attacking me, hitting me, kicking.
So you shoved him to get him off you.
Yeah.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I-I was scared... so I-I put him in the pit.
And then you poured acid in to make sure the body dissolved.
I was scared.
If he hated the idea of seeing me, he could've just said so.
I-I wouldn't have pushed it.
He probably didn't remember that he talked to you.
It was the same day.
Oh, God.
He's beautiful.
Absolutely perfect.
He looks like Lance, doesn't he?
Lance insisted that his first name be Seeley.
So he's Seeley Lance Wick-Sweets.
Do you want to be the first to hold him?
Lance would want you to be the first.
Okay, let's try your voice now.
Still got a lot of swelling in your vocal chords.
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
Someone he trusts.
Send her in.
How you feelin'?
My family hasn't come to see me.
My family?
The bakery didn't survive.
Peeta, what you're saying isn't real.
She sent you here to talk to me.
- Katniss?
- She's a mutt!
Have a seat.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
I can't send you there.
We can't get into The Capitol until we control District 2.
I saw Peeta... before we left.
And what did you think?
Something selfish.
What's goin' on in your head?
I don't know.
That's like kissing someone who's drunk.
Doesn't count.
You allow people enough time to rush in, help the wounded, then...
I guess there are no rules anymore about what a person can do to another person.
I don't think Snow used any rulebook when he hijacked Peeta.
President Coin, we're indebted to you for the reinforcements and the Mockingjay.
But I'm not sure that anyone outside of 2 knows what we've been up against.
It's manned by both military and civilian personnel from District 2.
As you can see, the fortress lies so far beneath the bedrock, it's untouchable.
Yesterday, we attempted to take the northeastern gate.
The enemy countered from higher up and we were forced to pull back.
We took heavy losses.
Whose troops do you propose as a decoy, commander?
You've been underground a long time, Madam Coin.
Then there is no sacrifice too great.
We need to control the arsenal inside that fortress.
Even with every district in this alliance, we are outgunned.
I won't commit my people to a ground assault just to pillage weapons.
Commander Paylor, your people have suffered more than just about anyone else at the hands of The Capitol.
Which is why I won't condone a mass suicide.
If we don't take District 2, we won't get into The Capitol.
Would it be enough to disable the fortress... instead of taking it?
What do you have in mind?
You trap the wolves inside, or you flush 'em out.
Bury them alive.
We'd forfeit any chance to control the weapons.
It's a luxury we weren't given when they firebombed 12.
There's gotta be a better way.
I suggest we try the avalanche, but leave the train tunnel alone.
Civilians can escape into the square, where our armies will be waiting for their surrender.
We should have every available medic standing by.
And if they won't surrender?
Then we will need a compelling voice to persuade them.
What's the difference, Katniss?
We were under attack in District 8.
Even if those civilians are just mopping' floors, they're helping the enemy.
And if they have to die, I can live with that.
No one who supports The Capitol is innocent.
It's war, Katniss.
Sometimes killing isn't personal.
Figured if anyone knew that, it was you.
I, of all people, know that it's always personal.
Don't worry, Katniss, there'll be survivors.
Let's focus on what it is you gotta say.
Now, Plutarch wrote a speech for you...
So you might wanna experiment with a little sensitivity, warmth.
Make it quick, you're exposed.
Get on the ground!
Drop the gun!
Drop it!
Drop it!
I can't.
We each have every reason to want to kill each other.
I'm tired of killing his slaves for him.
And Thresh killed Clove.
Always Snow.
I am done being a piece in his game.
You're family.
These people are not your enemy.
He corrupts everyone and everything.
He turns the best of us against each other.
Stop killing for him.
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.
Turn your weapons to Snow.
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.
Turn your weapons to Snow.
A toast.
Antonius, with our best troops crushed in the mountains and the rebels marching on us as we speak, what did we celebrate?
The death of the Mockingjay, sir.
If Peeta didn't kill her, her own arrogance did.
You have a habit of burying people before they're dead.
If the Mockingjay were gone, the rebels would already be using her as a martyr.
Sir, the rebels can be held off out...
The rebels will reach the outskirts of The Capitol in a matter of days.
We'll evacuate the outer blocks to let them in.
I want all anti-aircraft defenses ready, so we're secure from the skies.
Lure them into the city, and then our Gamemakers will make them pay for every inch with blood.
I want every camera watching.
We'll turn their advance into a celebration of suffering.
Let each moment be captured for all posterity.
So, what did we toast tonight, Minister Antonius?
We toasted a glorious era...
Well, there she is.
The Mockingjay.
You don't mind, do you?
They cut off my supply of morphling.
There's this head doctor that comes in and sees me every day, trying to help me adjust to reality.
Like some guy from this rabbit's warren actually knows anything about my reality.
At least 20 times in a session, he tells me that I'm totally safe.
So what are your injuries?
Bruised ribs, bruised lung.
I mean, it's everybody's job to keep you alive.
- Is that why you hate me?
The whole tacky romance drama and the "defender of the hopeless" act.
Feel free to take any of this personally.
But nobody likes me.
It's just stuff my family brought.
They messed us up pretty good, didn't they?
That still doesn't mean I'm going in there.
What's the harm in trying?
I watched you die.
- You look terrible.
- You've looked better.
You're not even remotely nice to say that to me now.
I remember... you in the rain.
I remember my mother hitting me.
I was supposed to give it to the pig.
That was the first we'd eaten in days.
Why would I take a beating like that for you?
Because you were kind and generous.
- And people said you loved me.
- Did people say you love me?
I think the only thing left to say is "thank you."
I need to be in The Capitol.
No, you have done your job.
Katniss, we won't let this momentum go to waste.
We'll shoot more propos right here in 13, showing them that you're alive.
I should be with the troops.
It'll be like being on the front lines.
I'll do whatever you need me to do.
One life, one purpose, one destiny.
You may kiss the bride.
You saw Peeta, didn't you?
Did you tell him "Hi" for me?
I'm going to kill Snow.
Nothing good is safe while he's alive.
And I can't make another speech about it.
He needs to see my eyes when I kill him.
Now you're talking.
Find a way to The Capitol when everybody's looking the other way.
You just have to be willing to sacrifice yourself.
Go on.
Don't you want Snow to see you dance?
Come on.
What is she doing?
I don't know, it's so frustrating when she goes rogue.
This isn't just adolescent, it's insubordination.
At the front lines, surviving a gunshot wound.
She's going to stay where she is.
Of course it was.
Mr. Heavensbee, you're the Gamemaker.
I want everyone to know, whatever game she's playing, she's playing for us.
I'm Commander Paylor of District 8.
I'm a soldier, like all of you, so here's what I know.
For the first time in our lifetimes, we're standing together with 13 districts.
From what I see here, we've already made history.
President Snow has pulled back Peacekeepers to fortify the center of the city.
We're deploying medical brigades to help anyone in need.
We'll show The Capitol people who we are.
To slow our advance, President Snow is building a minefield of traps and lethal devices called "pods."
The sadistic inventions of Gamemakers meant to make sport of our deaths.
If our armies make it past Peacekeepers and other defenses, we'll converge in the center of the city at Snow's mansion, where we won't just unlock his gates, but unshackle all of Panem.
If we die, let it be for a cause and not a spectacle.
If we succeed, let it be for all of Panem, and let it be forever.
Yes, you've already made history.
But the future, our future, starts tomorrow at dawn, when we march together into The Capitol.
Squad 451?
Looks like you got your meals covered.
- Tryin' to be prepared.
- Don't lie to me.
You gonna leave me behind, too?
But I couldn't stop you if you wanted to come.
Hawthorne, Everdeen, come meet your new unit.
I'm Lieutenant Jackson, and I wanna introduce you to your squad.
This is Second Lieutenant Mitchell, best sharpshooter in Panem.
Finnick?
Squad 451, you're my unit.
Lieutenant Jackson is my second-in-command.
Our instructions are to shoot propaganda footage on the battle-scarred streets of The Capitol.
You were handpicked to intimidate their forces.
And inspire surrenders.
It is likely that we'll encounter both active pods and Peacekeepers.
You're considered high-value targets to The Capitol.
I've already briefed you on the pods.
I remind you, they are on every block.
Our unit has been given a Holo.
A database that contains a detailed map of The Capitol and a list of every known pod.
These pods can trigger anything from bombs to traps to mutts.
Because we don't want the Gamemakers to know we have this intel, it has a self-destruct on it.
You flip this switch, say "nightlock" three times, and it blows itself and anything within a 10-foot radius.
Stay within our unit.
Even with the Holo, it is likely that new pods have been set.
Whatever they contain, they are meant to kill you.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 76th Hunger Games.
I've never seen this place so empty.
Just keep your eyes open.
Got a pod.
Let's take cover.
Shoot through those two buildings.
Pollux... right here.
Castor.
Good.
When you're ready, Katniss.
All clear.
I don't think we can get across this minefield.
Not without that Holo.
We're not gonna get it off him while he's awake.
Let's make sure we're on the same watch tonight.
Is that Peacekeepers?
We'll move forward a few blocks tomorrow and shoot the new footage.
The Leegs till 1700, Homes and Mitchell till 1900.
Give me a watch.
And if it really came down to it, you think you could shoot him?
I'm not sure that kind of a comment recommends you for the job, either, soldier.
Put her in the rotation.
We'll keep him contained.
Why would Coin do this?
She'd deny it, but...
What?
One way or another, this war is gonna come to an end.
Nobody would think I'd be a leader.
And if your immediate answer isn't "yes," then you're dangerous.
That's not gonna happen under my watch, Katniss.
Because you've earned it.
You're trying to decide whether or not you should kill me.
I never wanted to kill you.
And that's not what I'm doing.
In the first Games, I thought you were trying to help the Careers kill me.
After that, I always saw you... as an ally.
I'm sorry.
I just can't tell what's real and what's made up anymore.
Yours is orange.
Not bright orange.
You're a painter.
You're a baker.
You always sleep with the windows open.
You never take sugar in your tea.
You always double-knot your shoelaces.
You were right.
I can't do this.
Guess we're not leavin' anymore.
We're not going anywhere without that Holo.
Listen up.
Mag's empty.
It's only for the propo.
"To the citizens of The Capitol, our war is not with you."
To the citizens of The Capitol, our war is not with you.
Boggs.
This is a good spot.
Through there, in the courtyard.
Okay, let us clear it.
Got a pod.
Stay back.
Leegs, take the wings.
Everdeen, no!
Unfit for command.
Transfer primary security clearance...
Say your name.
Katniss Everdeen.
Katniss, don't trust them.
Let's go, soldiers!
Finnick!
Come on, come on!
Keep moving!
Keep moving to the top!
Go!
It's slowing down.
Gamemakers are still putting on quite a show.
Those surveillance cameras caught us.
Boggs gave it to me.
And why would he do that?
I'm on special orders from Coin.
I don't believe that for one second.
As your new unit commander, I order you to transfer security clearance to me now.
I can't do that.
Let's not lose our heads here.
He thinks if we could film the Mockingjay assassinating Snow, it'll make The Capitol surrender before the casualties get too high.
While we're arguing, there's 100 Peacekeepers on their way here.
Boggs promised me that when the time came, you would help me.
All right, soldier, Holo's yours.
We have to evacuate her.
I'm sorry.
I'll stay with her.
Can you walk?
Come on, this way.
Get these curtains closed.
It's the Leegs.
Katniss Everdeen, our once favorite daughter, has infiltrated the city with some of the victors, whose names are all too familiar.
Finnick Odair and Peeta Mellark.
Take a look at what happened just a moment ago, when our Peacekeepers cornered Katniss Everdeen and her band of foolish rebels.
Whatever arrogance brought this treacherous girl back to us, you are about to witness a great victory, not only for The Capitol, but for Panem.
So now that we're dead, what are we gonna do?
Isn't it obvious?
The next move is to kill me.
I murdered one of our squad members.
Katniss is right.
I'm a mutt.
And it's only a matter of time before I snap again.
I'm not in control.
I need a nightlock pill, so I can die when I need to.
If it gets to that point, I'll kill you myself.
I don't think I ever really understood The Capitol until now.
So Katniss Everdeen, a poor unstable girl with nothing but a small talent with a bow and arrow, is dead.
Not a thinker, not a leader.
Simply a face plucked from the masses.
Was she valuable?
She was extremely valuable to your rebellion because you have no vision, no true leader among you.
Your soldiers are at each other's throats.
I am President Alma Coin, leader of the rebellion.
I have interrupted a broadcast from your President in which he attempted to defame a brave young woman.
"A face picked from the masses," he called her.
Dead or alive, Katniss Everdeen will remain the face of this revolution.
She will not have died for nothing.
I had no idea I meant so much to her.
Her vision and ours will be realized.
A free Panem with self-determination for all.
It's at least 70, 75 blocks north.
Just about every ten steps.
Yeah, that doesn't even show the new ones.
So we can't go anywhere in the streets.
And the rooftops are just as bad.
There might be another way.
My brother knows these tunnels really well.
We're too exposed here.
Sir, should I call for your doctor?
- What did you say?
- Shall I call for your doctor?
I hope you've wakened me for something more urgent than an old man's health.
They survived.
The arena has moved underground.
Looks clear.
Everybody okay?
Yeah.
All right, everybody, we're gonna stop here for a bit and get some rest, yeah?
I'll take first watch.
All right, settle in, everybody.
You know, The Capitol, they used tracker jacker venom on me.
Real or not real?
Real.
They changed them.
You should get some rest.
Real.
That's what you and I do.
Keep each other alive.
Katniss?
Come on!
Move!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Go!
Peeta, come on!
Peeta, we have to keep going!
Stay with me.
Always.
I know where we are!
Keep going.
Someone's coming.
Shut the door, shut the door!
No, Katniss, it's okay, it's okay.
Tigris, do you remember me?
I'm with Plutarch's underground.
I know you.
You were a stylist in the Games.
Until Snow decided I wasn't pretty enough anymore.
I'm here to kill him.
Gale's gonna need stitches.
I made it up.
All of it.
I killed them.
I killed Finnick.
I'm sorry, Pollux.
I'm so sorry.
Glimmer, Marvel, Mags Clove, Wiress, Rue.
What do all those deaths mean?
They mean that our lives were never ours.
There was no real life because we didn't have any choice.
Our lives belong to Snow and our deaths do, too.
They chose this.
They chose you.
You should cuff me.
It's not safe with me yet.
You should cuff me.
I can't sleep.
Yeah, I haven't slept in days, either.
No, she never would have forgiven you.
She needed you to be there and take care of her family and you did.
She can't lose you.
She really loves you.
No, you won her over.
You gave up everything for her.
Well, it's not gonna be an issue much longer.
That's not outside the city.
Sun's comin' up.
There you will be provided with food, medicine, safety for your children, and you will have my solemn oath to protect you until my dying breath.
They are coming to destroy our way of life.
They are coming to bury us.
Every Peacekeeper's gonna be waiting.
Next to our faces on every billboard.
Snow's offering shelter to all the refugees.
We got one shot.
Let's make it count.
Good luck, Katniss.
Thank you.
Pollux.
Tigris, thank you for everything you've done.
Stay alive.
If I see you again, it's gonna be a different world.
Ready, Katniss?
Let's go.
By order of President Snow, all residents must proceed to the Presidential Estate.
Please, continue to move forward in a calm and orderly fashion.
Additional food, medicine and clothing will be provided upon arrival.
By order of President Snow, all residents must proceed to the Presidential Estate.

Mama!
Shoot me!
Shoot me!
The gates will open momentarily.
The children will be received first.
It's The Capitol!
Medic!
Prim?
Primrose!
Fight was over after The Capitol dropped those bombs to defend the palace.
The rebels walked right in.
Everybody felt it.
It was...
It was over after that.
Mom?
I brought all your things.
Well, I'll leave you to get settled.
That's a nice one.
I was hoping you'd find your way here.
There are so many things we should discuss.
But I have a feeling your visit will be brief, so first things first.
I wanted to tell you how very sorry I am about your sister.
In fact, I was just about to issue an official surrender when they released those parachutes.
You released those parachutes.
You really think I gave the order?
I take life for specific reasons.
And there was no reason for me to destroy a pen full of Capitol children.
I must concede, it was a masterful move on Cain's part.
There was no resistance left inside The Capitol or the mansion.
Do you know it aired live?
There's a particular savvy in that, isn't there?
I'm sure she wasn't gunning for your sister, but these things happen in war.
My failure was in being so slow to grasp Coin's plan.
She let The Capitol and the Districts destroy one another, then she stepped in to take power with 13's arsenal.
Oh, make no mistake, she intends to take my place now.
I'm afraid we've both been played for fools.
I don't believe you.
President Coin asked for you.
You never came to see me.
I wanted to, but...
Was it ours?
The bomb.
The delayed explosion.
Was that you?
I don't know.
All I know is that I was supposed to take care of your family.
Now I'm sorry I couldn't.
You can't protect anyone in an arena.
Goodbye, Gale.
What's this?
I have invited you all here for several reasons, but first, I have an announcement.
I have taken the burden and the honor of declaring myself Interim President of Panem.
Interim?
Exactly how long is that interim?
We have no way of knowing for certain.
But it's clear that people are far too emotional right now to make a rational decision.
We'll plan an election when the time is right.
But I have called you here for a far more important vote.
A symbolic vote.
This afternoon, we will execute Snow.
But the danger is, once we begin, the rebels will not stop calling for retribution.
You wanna have another Hunger Games with The Capitol's children?
- You're joking?
- Not in the slightest.
Is this Plutarch's idea?
No, obviously not.
I say "yes."
So do I. Let them have a taste of it.
You guys, this way of thinking is what started these uprisings.
I vote "no." With Peeta.
We need to stop viewing each other as enemies.
It's down to Katniss and Haymitch.
I get to kill Snow.
I expected no less of you.
Haymitch?
I'm with the Mockingjay.
We'll announce the Games tonight, after the execution.
Well, it's bound to be quite the show.
Oh, you look lovely as ever.
Just beautiful.
Finishing touches.
Welcome to the new Panem.
Today, on the Avenue of the Tributes, all of Panem, a free Panem, will watch more than a mere spectacle.
We are gathered to witness an historic moment of justice.
Today, the greatest friend to the revolution will fire the shot to end all wars.
May her arrow signify the end of tyranny and the beginning of a new era.
No!
Kill him!
Well, Plutarch gave me a letter for you.
"Katniss, maybe the country was shocked tonight by your arrow, but once again, I was not.
You were exactly who I believed you were.
Tonight, the 12 District leaders will call for a free election.
I'm sorry so much burden fell on you.
I know you'll never escape it.
Of course, we're fickle, stupid beings, with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction.
I've secured you a ride out of The Capitol.
It's better for you to be out of sight.
What now?
I couldn't let you go without a proper goodbye.
It's your job to take care of yourself now, Katniss.
The life of a Victor.
Effie, don't be a stranger.
She's gone.
Get out!
Peeta?
I found these, uh, out by the edge of the forest.
It's a primrose.
So sorry, Katniss.
"You'll be happy to hear that Katniss' mother has been training new medical units in The Capitol.
Gale has been promoted to a captain in District 2 to help keep order and security.
And I am loving every moment with my son who reminds me every day of his father.
I solemnly swear to the best of my ability, to preserve, protect, and uphold the rights of every citizen of Panem.
There's Plutarch, right in the middle of it all.
And they say no one ever wins the Games.
You love me.
Real or not real?
Real.
Did you have a nightmare?
I have nightmares, too.
But I'll tell you how I survive it.
I make a list in my head of all the good things I've seen someone do.
Every little thing I can remember.
It's like a game.
I do it over and over.
Gets a little tedious after all these years, but there are much worse games to play.
Breathe the air, Mrs. Donnelly!
I'm eating dust.
The wind in your hair!
Put the bloody top back on, Sonny!
I will not hear your negativity.
Madam, this is Route 66 and we are most assuredly getting our kicks!
I'm Chet and I'll be happy to valet your car.
Not as happy as we are that you are happy to do so, my friend.
Just tell me there's a cup of tea and a biscuit waiting inside.
If not now, when?
And if not us, who?
Later?
Somebody else?
My hand is powdered, so the shake is firm and dry.
My clothes precisely walk the tightrope between casual and relaxed formality.
Mr. Burley.
While I am aware that convention dictates that I should wait for your assessment of our proposal please take my interruption less as rudeness than proof of our profound excitement at the opportunity to meet yourself and your fine company.
And let me say right here and now...
Alright, that's enough, that's enough.
We agreed that my colleague would do the speaking and rightly so for while her language may be... salty, it has great economy and pith.
I don't care about any of that.
No, listen and learn, son.
That is boiling water.
Everywhere I've been in this country they slap down a cup of tepid nonsense you know with the teabag lying beside it which means I've got to go through the ridiculous business of dunking it in the lukewarm piss waiting for the slightest change of color to occur.
This is what I'm talking about.
Get her some boiling water.
We've been going properly for about eight months now.
But phase two of the development is more or less complete.
- Mrs. Evelyn Greenslade.
- Mr. Douglas Ainslie.
- Mrs. Muriel Donnelly.
- Mrs. Madge Hardcastle.
We have monthly check-ups at the local clinic and Sonny takes a roll-call every morning.
A most valuable precaution to ensure that nobody has died in the night.
Most of our guests don't just live in India, they now work there.
- These are lovely.
- That is why they cost 10,000 rupees each.
The reason I come to this stall is that whereas Bharat over there uses wool and Mohan goes with the rabbit fur you at least use a reasonable quality of silk.
I'll give you 5,000 for four.
- Done.
- Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow, Hari.
Norman I know the membership's dropping, times are tight, but do you really have to water down the wine?
They're on to us.
Let's try the red.
And others are doing jobs they never thought they could do.
One Queen was so close to her elephant that when she passed away, the elephant stood beside her tomb for three days before dying of grief.
We should all know such love, just not necessarily from an elephant.
And sometimes they're right, they can't.
- When were these built?
Look, I could talk and talk but all that counts in the end is this one had an idea.
I know, I know, but it works.
The proof of our success is we are victims of it.
The Marigold Hotel is full up.
So we have to expand.
- There's a local place we've got our eye on.
- The Supreme Quality Hotel.
Leading to a chain of hotels stretching across India and beyond for those such as this great lady whose face is a map of the world and whose mind, though failing, still contains many of the secrets of the universe.
Who had the chance to say, when she left her home for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel as others will do "Why die here "when I can die there?"
We believe that the well that the leaves don't need to fall.
That these years, the mature years are an opportunity for travel, for further education for different work situations.
Well, in a word, an opportunity for life.
And for passing on the value of that life to others.
I take it you would agree with me, Mrs. Donnelly?
I'm here, aren't I?
Are you talking to other companies about this?
We came to you first.
- We do have competitors.
- Not in our eyes.
- And did you tell them about the roll-call?
- With a spoon, they ate it up.
Hoops, Sunaina.
Before our triumph is complete, there is one more through which we must jump.
At some point in the next soon, Mr. Burley has promised to send an evaluator to the hotel.
Undercover. "His guy," he called him, to check us out.
The engagement party is on Thursday and we have dance rehearsal at the Viceroy Club at 4.
And I have some exciting news about that.
Let me put just one word in your mind, Sunaina.
"Elopement." We elope.
Kushal?
- I did not know you were in Jaipur.
Have you just come for the wedding celebrations, Kushal?
Only to go away again?
Immediately, straight afterwards, for a very long time?
Isn't this great?
I have to go now.
So they're looking at me, awaiting my wisdom and knowledge and I have none of either.
How many times have you done that tour now?
- I should have stern words with your assistant.
Well... goodnight.
I wonder, do you fancy a cup of coffee?
- Or chai, perhaps, would be more appropriate.
- I actually don't have any coffee.
- Or chai for that matter.
- And you, too.
Suddenly I realized I wasn't alone.
So I turned round to see who was tapping me on the shoulder.
Only the bloody Archbishop of Canterbury.
It's funny because it's true.
Yes, and unfortunately, it's neither.
- Are you walking out with us, Norman?
- No, I'm afraid I I've got to stay here and count up the meager takings, I'm afraid, Susan.
Well, unless you need some help finding a taxi.
- Yes, what is it?
- Miss Carol is on the phone.
She's wondering when you'll be back.
Well... another time.
Well, goodnight.
The thing is, you see, what one has never ever had before is opportunity.
Yeah, but I can't indulge myself, or indulge them because I have already got one and I think the absolute world of her.
Still, one does think what if she weren't there at all?
I mean, what if one were alone again?
How impossibly free one would be.
I'd miss her dreadfully, of course.
But I'd have a bloody good time.
If you only go once around the room, you are wiser than he who remains sitting still.
And thus we two return to India with new ideas and greater enlightenment of the state of the world and humanity.
That flight made my ankles swell.
I missed you, too.
- Sonny's mother has arrived.
- Let's go back to America.
- Then let us go see them.
Is Vikram outside with his beautiful minibus?
- She doesn't need to meet him.
- Can he help with balloon ankles?
- I can do heavy.
Shall we go?
Who carries grapefruit oil in their car?
So sorry.
Have you ordered?
I'm told the Chilla pancakes here are not to be missed.
You're probably wondering why I requested this meeting.
I presume it's to tell me my services are no longer required.
Why would you think that?
Well, I've loved buying fabrics and textiles for you.
And after three months we were either going professional or giving the whole thing up.
And please tell whoever it is that I'm around to impart what little wisdom I...
We would like you to be in charge of sourcing for our whole operation in this country.
- I'm 79 years old.
- We don't mind if you don't.
We'll give you a team to work under you, of course.
- It's going to mean some travel.
Well, I say riding, damn thing broke down again, I was pushing it.
- Do you mind if I join you?
- No, please do.
- I'm Douglas, by the way.
Have you?
Well, congratulations.
She hasn't said "yes" yet.
What's stopping her?
You see I think the problem this time is the piston which must have had what we call a seizure.
But, luckily, Cyril at the bike shop has this tool called a gudgeon pin remover which should minimize damage to the bearing at either end of the con rod or, God forbid, the con rod itself.
I think you're just making these words up.
Would you have asked my opinion?
Sorry?
If I hadn't have come in, would you have talked it over with me before saying "yes"?
Of course I'd have told you tonight and asked you what you thought.
Thank you.
Good morning, Ainslie.
Morning, you two.
Not riding the bike, Douglas?
- We just popped out for some of those pancakes.
- I don't suppose you'd care to join...
Something must have gone wrong with his steering.
It almost looked as if he was aiming straight at you.
How I wish I could prevail upon you to stay.
Always leave them wanting more, Nimish.
Are we going to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, madam?
- Your Highness.
- Welcome.
In this hand, I'm nothing but putty.
If you like it, you should put a ring on it.
Would you mind waiting?
I don't quite know how long I'll be.
Your command is my wish.
- He will wait.
- Yes, but can you?
Tough.
For home are the happy hunters and fat is the lamb that we have slaughtered!
How was America?
It made death more tempting.
Oh, look.
These are for your mother, apke ma.
These are for your father, apke pita.
Come here.
- I was just checking in a guest.
- You scare the guests.
I'll do it.
She must be the reason why things are going so smoothly.
It takes teamwork to make a dream work, Mummyji.
Cousin Sapna.
And little Ranjan.
And breakfast is served on the terrace between 7:00 and 10:00, Miss Beech.
- With roll-call at 9:00 precisely.
Although you, dear lady, are nearer the menopause than the mortuary.
Do fill in, please.
- Oh, good morning.
- Is this the Marigold Hotel?
- Do you have a reservation?
With great pride and joy I offer you room 6, the jewel in our crown.
- Overlooking the restaurant.
- I was hoping for somewhere quite private.
Another new guest.
Like lemmings they come to the cliff edge that is the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
I'm so sorry, we're full up.
That's disappointing.
Come, Miss Beech, your palace awaits.
I saw you at the airport, didn't I?
Lavinia Beech.
The name again, please?
I am Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, owner and proprietor of this great and sincerely profitable hotel.
- Don't you want to see my passport?
- I know who you are, Mr. Chambers.
Room 19 is not finished yet.
What can carpeting achieve that a good pair of slippers cannot?
- I'd really rather the room that I...
- Please, Miss Beech, say it walking...
Now.
One moment.
What is your problem?
I have never seen such rudeness.
Bigger fish are frying, Sunaina.
Mr. Burley promised he would send someone to evaluate the hotel.
- That's not much to go on.
- Instinct, Sunaina.
It goes well with my poppy-out ears.
Yeah, these aren't bad.
Not bad at all.
- Good evening, Mrs. Donnelly.
- Evening, Mrs. Greenslade.
- We understand there are grounds for optimism.
I went with low expectations and came back disappointed.
Given your age, I'm impressed you came back at all.
- When's your next check-up?
- Evening, all.
- Evening, Mrs. Hardcastle.
He even followed me to the lavatory.
Everyone, this is Lavinia Beech.
- Well, I'm here for my mother.
Not that one needs an excuse to escape the six weeks of warm rain that constitute an English summer.
For who?
Lordy lord, have mercy on my ovaries.
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen this is the great Guy Chambers.
As welcome as he is fragrant.
Perhaps tomorrow you will allow me to take you on a tour of our magnificent Pink City.
But now I shall bring you food guaranteed to tickle even your most talented taste buds.
- He's the one.
- What one?
What's your evidence?
That's a coincidence because I read novels.
It's just been kind of a dream until now.
Any other dreams I can help you with?
So, what's it about?
Yes, well, you've come to the right place for that.
How many tuk-tuks are there with bloody scorpions on them?
And the driver is completely lethal.
Of course I don't know his name but he's got one eye.
- There you are.
I'm sure you'll sort it, darling.
To the travel agency where I work.
- Why don't I walk with you?
There was a power cut.
- Only insomuch as it matters to you.
- But still you came.
- I know, for Laura's conference.
- I was thinking, why don't you come?
She's my daughter, I'd like you to meet her.
- With the new job and everything.
- I would love to meet her.
- It'll happen.
You should marry that girl.
I want to.
Where's our new guest?
Which one?
The American...
I didn't see him at breakfast...
The man with no plan who still gets the best room.
- I felt really bad about that.
So how's the new room?
He's my son.
Don't speak to the guests, Mummyji.
Mr. Chambers was just telling me how comfortable he is at the hotel.
Hope to see you again.
Go on, Mummyji.
And now, good sir, for our tour.
Let us find Vikram and his beautiful minibus, and taste the pleasures of our fine city.
Could I come along?
I was just about to brave the city on my own.
Madam, this perfect specimen and I were planning to spend the day alone together.
- I didn't mean to intrude.
- Of course she can come.
Of course you can come.
It's difficult.
Every morning I take a taxi to the roundabout and I have a decision.
I'm pretty sure they're going to propose soon enough.
Just because I'm looking at you when you talk, don't think I'm interested or listening.
No, I don't care.
...and crowned his achievement with the magnificence that is the Hawa Mahal.
The Palace Of The Winds.
This is the palace?
This is the Supreme Quality Hotel.
Well played indeed, my friend.
Your eye does not flicker and the cards stay close to your noble chest.
Clearly whoever named this establishment had a sense of mischief.
But had he named it the Supreme Potential Hotel then, my friends, we would be talking.
- I wanted to ask you about your mother.
- I can only apologize.
Here is our planned installation of an elevator.
Easy access for the elderly to the higher floors before they make the greatest climb of all.
And from here to the hospital it is but a short walk or a stretcher ride.
Why, why do you ask?
I don't know, I'm just really struck by her.
- By whom?
- I'm sorry?
- My mother?
Not the last time I looked.
Kushal?
To what do we owe this... pain?
Funny guy.
Why are you here, Kushal?
And please explain the hat.
You wouldn't want to read this, darling.
Please excuse her, madam.
Babul, madam.
- Is this your daughter?
- My niece, Aaina.
She was in an accident and needs many hours of physiotherapy.
And you bring her, and wait?
There's no present like the time.
I also bring banana chips.
Shall we go?
He knows a thing or two.
Please tell me there'll be something for the old people to dance to.
Because we can still shake it, you know.
Don't worry, Aruva's a professional.
So when do you and Sunaina do your dance?
It depends on whether Sonny ever gets here for the rehearsal.
- Sonny boy.
- Don't call me that.
Your friend Kush has cheated us out of what is rightfully ours.
What are you talking about?
- Had you made an offer on it?
- We don't have the money yet.
Then how did he cheat you?
- I saw it, I contacted my investor.
How hard it must be not to choke on the silver spoon in your mouth.
- Ask him if he knew.
- Did you know anything?
Why are you being like this?
That's why I'm here.
Shall we?
Host is looking dapper.
Big night, isn't it?
A happy conclusion to a slightly bumpy journey.
That's really the point, isn't it?
For all relationships, the journey.
Because the really frustrating thing is, we could be madly happy.
And not to take the risk, when it's so close you could almost reach out and touch it.
The great and terrible thing about life there's just so much bloody potential.
All of which is almost certainly nonsense and I've no idea what I'm talking about.
I think I might have taken out a hit on my girlfriend.
You're going to have to drive some pretty hard bargains with the factory owners.
You're gonna have to get used to that.
I can't tell you the family holidays I'd have had to blow out if I had a family.
- How long have you guys been together?
I'm going to be so late for this party.
It's been a while since I had one suitor, let alone two.
Something of a dry spell.
Good evening, Mrs. Donnelly.
Oh, you look so beautiful.
Sonny, your mother needs to spend some time with my parents.
- For the guest of honor.
- We are the guests of honor.
I was thinking of celebrating by asking your mother for a dance.
Really?
You're looking very fine tonight, Norman.
I don't suppose you've seen Carol anywhere, have you?
Here...
I've noticed.
You're happy.
I hate this machine.
- Turns out she's coming here.
- I thought she was going to Mumbai.
- So the two of you will finally get to meet.
And she can see for herself that all the things I've told her about you are true.
I hear you're going to dance tonight.
You're probably thinking I'm a little young to be staying at the Marigold.
Either that or your plastic surgeon's a genius.
I'm... quite interested in your new place.
Come by again sometime.
That means I will.
- I don't think so.
- Are you pimping out your own mother?
Well, I wouldn't mind but...
- I'll get over it.
- Forgive me.
Now, have either of you seen Carol?
I honestly thought it might help.
I thought if I could see them at the same time, I'd know which one I preferred which port in the storm I'd choose.
But it didn't work out that way.
Some you win, my lady, and some you learn.
And I don't know why, but I rather snubbed his kind invitation to go with him to Mumbai.
Where, as it turns out, I'm going anyway.
So we'd actually be there together.
I don't know if I'm excited or terrified.
Sometimes it seems to me that the difference between what we want and what we fear is the width of an eyelash.
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
The hearing's gone then, obviously.
Yeah, along with your backbone.
- I don't know why I tell you anything.
- Because I'm older and wiser.
- 19 days older.
- That's the entire lifespan of a wasp.
Well, we start by you telling me what your name is.
It's Mrs. Kapoor.
That's all I get?
I'm generally kinder to people than to animals.
What do you want from me?
I went, now you go.
- What do you really want?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I prefer cats.
I figured.
Have dinner with me.
Whenever you want.
What makes you think I'll say yes?
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests the moment you've all been waiting for.
Please welcome to the dance floor, Jay and Kush...
This is our night, Sonny.
Ours.
Nobody... nobody panic.
Are you okay?
You better pray I don't find you in the dark.
- I don't believe this.
- Neither do I. It's outrageous.
Don't pretend you're not relieved.
- You think I'd organize a power cut?
What is more important than your engagement?
If I could see where your leg is, I'd kick it.
Really?
Really.
You're screwing up, Sonny boy.
I went to one once where the best man and the groom were found in bed together.
Which still went slightly better than tonight.
- I'm sure I paid that bill.
- It was a power cut, it happens.
Just, please, no-one tell Madge.
- No-one tell Madge what?
But, absurdly, as it happens, I now have to go to Mumbai.
I don't know how long I'm going to be there but the time that I am perhaps we could...
Hello, Dad.
Darling!
Hello, Douglas.
It was all so delightfully last minute.
Yes, a bit of warning would have been nice.
- You didn't get my texts?
- I hate that machine.
About the exponential growth of internet start-ups and the consequent effect on...
Daniel has been saying I was looking tired and could do with a holiday.
It's typically him to be so considerate and caring.
You can take your pick.
I don't understand.
Daniel's proposed to me, Douglas.
He's asked me to marry him.
I'm here to get a divorce.
- Mr. Guy Chambers.
- I am here.
Mrs. Jean and Miss Laura Ainslie.
You can see us!
Mr. Douglas Ainslie.
- Mrs. Muriel Donnelly.
- What's left.
Mrs. Madge Hardcastle.
Mrs. Evelyn Greenslade.
- Mrs. Evelyn Green...
- Can't find her.
She's gone.
This is very exciting.
Not too short notice, I hope.
You've been to Mumbai before, surely?
Hari, I wonder, could you do me a favor from now on?
I think it's important if we're going to be working together.
Could you always just tell me the truth?
These are serious business negotiations.
Carol!
Taxi!
Sunaina you're waiting for an apology.
For that there is no excuse and I am completely and sincerely sorry.
- Thank you.
- In my defense...
Because he bought a building?
He didn't even know you were interested in it.
"Coincidence" is just a word for when we cannot see the bigger plan.
All your guests are happy here.
Nobody is going anywhere else.
Let us delay this conversation until the moment I'm proved right when perhaps it will be your turn to apologize to me.
What would you like, Miss Beech?
- Could I have a cup of tea, please?
- I'll get you a fresh pot.
Just hot water and a teabag on the side would be marvelous.
Lavinia was curious about that new place you showed us.
- The Supreme Quality, was that the name?
Six stairs without a rest is about all she can manage now.
Maybe we should take another look.
And also because the new proprietor is quite handsome.
Truly, madam, you're on fire today.
Can't you make this thing go any faster?
My pedal is to the metal, boss.
Left or right, madam?
I'm sorry, what?
When we reach the turning, with which gentleman do you wish to spend your time?
Oh, left.
How's your niece doing?
She's bored and frustrated.
Her first question to the doctor was whether she would still be able to dance.
- Is she good?
- She makes movement into magic.
You have no children yourself?
I did not marry, madam.
I just never fell in love.
Didn't stop me.
Stop here!
Oh, my very generous friend!
It is over!
You want to do a deal with me?
You... haven't understood a word of what I've been talking about, have you?
You you just... brought her to work.
Darling...
- So do we have this clear?
- Very clear, Uncle.
- Are you sure?
- Categorically not.
I'll tell them where to stick their ball.
Now I sleep wonderfully.
Although one does rather miss a rose on one's pillow in the morning.
Have you met Daniel?
Have you thought about our conversation last night?
- Which option are you plumping for?
I think she actually went to start her new job.
What a busy little pensioner bee she is.
This is a process that takes many weeks and involves 12 separate dyes to produce the finished product.
The intricate patterns require 40 passes over the cloth and each pass involves the entire length of the table.
There are 8 tables in this room and 24 in all.
We will process around 2,000 meters of cloth in a day.
And as you know, ma'am, the workforce is highly skilled.
And when I run my fingers through my hair, say it with great authority.
30 really is the most we can offer.
- I'm not sure you understand the work involved.
- I understand perfectly, but 30 is our limit.
He's my partner, not my assistant and he has full authority to conduct this negotiation himself.
Of course.
My friend we can get four for this price anywhere else.
You're just asking more because it's her...
You think because you're with this white woman that you've climbed a treetop?
You think her white hair is going to fluster me?
Don't talk rubbish!
Every single word... ...?
What did I say?
That you understood every word he was saying and he should have more respect for his elders.
Well, he does now.
I thought you'd have left for the Sangeet already.
- Where have you been?
- I was working late.
You'd gone before I woke up.
Right.
You've missed me, you sweet man.
Are you not worried about him?
There's no point in worrying if there's nothing you can do.
Sonny, in a few days we will all be one family.
And in this family, we do not tell each other what to do.
I will find another hotel into which we can expand.
- Just listen to what he has to say.
And just like that, another good party dies a death.
Sonny, thanks for hearing me out.
I want us to form a partnership.
But to keep growing, you've got to have somewhere to grow into.
As part of the company we form together, equal partners.
I know you began this journey on your own, but you've gone as far as you can without help.
Without me.
What do you say?
I can see you're talking now, Kushal.
Your lips are moving.
But all I hear is the soft hiss of treachery and betrayal.
Mrs. Donnelly, can you please talk to this guy?
- What's your advice, Mrs. Donnelly?
- Never to give any.
Listen, think about it, take some time.
Five is more than enough.
Is there really nothing you can do?
Are you really writing a book?
Well, I'm trying, yeah.
My son thinks you're not who you say you are.
Is that why you came?
So tell me about your book.
It was meant to be a story about the end of things but now maybe it's about the beginning of them.
It's about a man who whose life has fallen apart and he's done what people do when they've been bruised.
He circles the wagons, he shuts down.
But now he's, he's come somewhere very far away and suddenly he's awake.
That would be kind of a short story if she did.
I think that she's scared.
But she wouldn't trust him if he said that, so...
Actually, I don't think she trusts anybody, really.
Least of all herself, which is probably a sign that she's become become someone who she doesn't really wanna be.
And every day that goes by makes it harder to remember that she once was passionate, willful.
Which is why he's not pushing.
And another.
To see what happens.
That's my story.
Or at least what I know of it so far.
Shall we write the next chapter?
I don't know what to do, Mrs. Donnelly.
I used always to dream of the future but now all I see is him in front of me.
You know, there's a long list of things I don't care for.
- Don't let that happen.
- Then tell me what to do, madam.
- You have to work that out on your own.
- Evening all.
- Good evening, Mrs. Hardcastle.
- In before midnight.
- Only two customers.
Oh, call for the doctor, Sonny.
Nimish asked me to marry him this morning.
And Abhilash did the same this afternoon.
Decision time.
Your mother was one of the customers.
It appears she won the Mr. Chambers lottery.
I didn't even realize she was playing.
Congratulations would have been nice.
- I believe they were here tonight.
- I could not possibly say, sir.
Did they leave together?
The Viceroy Club values discretion above all else, sir.
You cannot put a price on it.
1,000 rupees.
They went into one of the bedrooms, sir.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure doing business with you.
Sonny?
What are you doing here?
I think that's my line, Mummyji.
- What kind of business?
- He's not an inspector.
- If that's what he's saying, he's lying to you.
I don't want to see you hurt, Mummyji.
I can take care of myself, beta.
And your business can wait till the morning.
Go home now.
Is there anything else I can get you for morning?
I'd like breakfast in my room at 9:00, please.
And Earl Grey tea with pasteurized milk.
That's very important.
- Anyone for a quick drink before bed?
- I'd quite like a walk along the bay.
Douglas, I was joking.
I'd rather walk naked through the fiery flames of hell.
Bye, darling.
She checked out, sir.
- I beg your pardon?
- Mrs. Greenslade checked out earlier, sir.
Did she say where she was going?
I tell you, he turned white as a sheet.
It was the Hindi scolding that did the job.
I thought my mother has walked into the room.
- Thank you, that was delicious.
- Thank you.
So kind of you to put me up.
When you live in a hotel, you rather crave an alternative occasionally.
That was rubbish about the hotel.
The truth is that I checked out because there's something I can't deal with at the moment.
For reasons that are utterly stupid and feeble.
I'm only telling you because you don't know the person involved.
Mr. Douglas.
My friend is mending his bike.
He's a good man.
I want to say to him, "Just give me time and I'll get there."
If I wasn't so useless, that's what I'd say. "Just give me a bit more time."
How much time do you have?
I'll probably just have a sandwich at my desk.
- I could bring it to you.
- You are so sweet.
- Good morning.
Might I have some of that, please?
Now, Sunaina are you allowed to tell me about your dress or is...
- Hello, Dad.
- Morning, darling.
I've been trying to learn my speech for the wedding.
Thought I'd do it note-free.
Darling...
What?
Then what are you waiting for?
Bollocks to that!
You wouldn't understand a word.
Dad.
Don't make me even more like mum than I am already.
You have all the good bits, all the brilliant bits.
Go on.
- Thank you.
- Much more than alright.
Of course.
This way.
Hello, darling.
She still wants to read your book.
Your uncle told me how very brave you're being and I thought you deserved a reward.
Twirling away.
I wasn't bad, I don't think, but I gave it up.
Just like most things in my life.
Which is your house?
What a lovely place to have lived.
I'm very happy you came.
- Because he's not the inspector.
And you've done nothing but show her the back of your hand since she got here.
That is absolutely not true.
My God, that is true.
Might I ask most humbly if you have plans for today and, if so, can I feature in them?
I was actually just on my way to see Kushal.
And is that, if so bold I might be, for the purposes of business or pleasure?
Both, really.
No offense, but I think in the end the Supreme Quality will just suit my mother perfectly.
Room 6 will shortly be available.
So, Mr. Chambers.
Could you hold on a sec, Miss Beech?
The great Mr. Chambers.
The great writer Mr. Chambers.
What did you wanna tell me?
To leave this hotel and never darken its towels again.
- How did you know that?
- It's his business to know.
And ours to know what he's up to.
Please explain.
That would be me.
I told you.
The nose knew.
While there are patterns we can study to mitigate the amplitude of the extreme highs and lows that characterize any entrepreneurial journey, they'll come anyway.
But don't let that stop you because the highs like being here today with you all, make everything worthwhile.
They were riveted.
Laura's success continues, evidently.
What exactly is your job here?
Sourcing fabrics and liaising between the merchants and the company I work for.
- Doesn't that just trip off the tongue.
- It's easier to say than to do.
Well, you look as if you're handling it.
I must say, I admire what you've made of yourself here.
There's only one thing puzzling me.
Do you not fancy him?
Even when I could hardly stand the man, I still found him rather attractive.
In some ways rather more so than Daniel.
Well, Douglas has one great advantage over Daniel which is that he actually exists.
Daniel exists.
- He does.
- Oh, if you say so.
Money doesn't stretch as far in Reigate as in Rajasthan.
Daniel knows my name, of course, we're a small team.
But he hasn't proposed, I grant you that.
That's why I want the divorce.
I can hardly expect a man to want to go out with me while I'm still married.
What do you suppose we should do for our first date?
Which will prevent any possible awkwardness.
- There won't be any awkwardness.
- No, I don't suppose there will be.
There are some people into whose laps the good things in life fall.
I'm not one of them.
Coming out here finally taught me that.
So, if the good things won't come on their own, I must make them.
And that's what I intend to do.
- You can't come in.
I don't want you to see the dress until Friday.
I need my clipboard.
- I must apologize to you.
- You apologized already.
I mean it more now.
And I promise you three things.
I promise I will properly rehearse the wedding dance.
I promise I'll wear the turban your mother chose for the ceremony.
And I promise I'll be a better husband than fiancé.
Good... because you're a terrible fiancé.
Listen to me.
If there is ever a time in our life together when I find myself attracted to another man or even confused a little, I will always tell you.
And that way, you know that I will never, ever act on it.
I don't find Kush attractive.
His ears are too close to his head.
I hoped you would find his offer of a partnership more attractive.
But that is up to you.
Have you seen my other shoe, darling?
Your shoe's under the bed.
- And you're having an affair.
Well, you have.
That's not fair.
Do you mean I didn't need to be carrying on with any of these men?
There's more than one?
I am only out there because I thought you were.
You know, when we met you said you were lonely.
I don't want to be that lonely again, Norman.
Neither do I.
Mr. Norman Cousins and Miss Carol Parr.
Both here!
Miss Theresa Beech.
Present.
- If no longer correct.
- Miss Madge Hardcastle.
Here.
- Mrs. Muriel Donnelly.
- Just about.
- Mr. Douglas Ainslie.
- Learning my speech.
A couple of days, I'll be fine.
Mrs. Evelyn Greenslade.
Mr. Guy Chambers.
Now whether you want my good wishes or not you'll have them on your wedding day.
How will you rate us?
Not that it matters now, but what will the report say?
Shall I be frank?
A welcome change.
To say that there is huge room for improvement in the running of this hotel would be to understate the surreally haphazard nature of your operation.
Thank you... for your feedback.
But the fact that you get away with it I mean, it's a testament to the to the reservoirs of affection in which you're held by the residents here.
No-one can put a price on that.
I see.
But you've got another inspector right here.
I don't like the people she works for but if that's the only game in town...
We've spoken already.
Her recommendation is also based upon the acquisition of the Supreme Quality Hotel.
Why don't you just do a deal with him?
If only for the sake of your beautiful bride.
Right, well I'll be, I'll be staying at the Viceroy until my plane leaves.
What are you going to do?
Write my book.
She knows the story.
Mr. Chambers.
Allow me to offer you a lift to the Viceroy Club.
Vikram's beautiful minibus awaits.
Please.
Good.
Death by cow.
I suppose it would make people sit up and take notice.
Yeah, I wouldn't want that.
I'd like everyone to turn around one day and realize I've already gone.
Well, I'm taking the job.
And then I thought, "As many as we like." While we can.
- Be a lot of traveling.
- How else could I come home afterwards?
You'd be missed.
You do know that?
You must know that.
Anyway, Mrs. Greenslade, the wedding is nearly upon us.
It's a big day.
For all of us.
I never understood why anyone would want to get married.
I barely found a bugger I could spend a week with let alone a life.
But I've been looking forward to this.
And it turns out some things really are worth the wait.
I'm not good with special occasions or the gifts that go with them.
I said at your party, I don't do advice.
I do opinions.
...I must tell you, the reception cannot take place at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
A bride as radiant as this one deserves a more splendid setting for her wedding party and I have just the place.
But for now, to your chariots!
And let us travel to the new jewel in my crown!
The apple of my eye!
Let us travel to the pearl in my oyster!
No longer the Viceroy Club but my gift on her wedding day to the girl of my dreams, where I will welcome you.
Ladies and Germs I wonder if I could have your attention just for a moment.
I have a few words I'd like to say:
A few words of Alfred, Lord Tennyson speaking to something which we all know, and should never forget.
That every hour brings new things.
And it's a privilege to be able to send them on their way in such remarkable style.
Actually, talking of style I had a fairytale wedding myself.
Pause for laugh.
Moving on...
The two things we can give our children, it seems to me it seems to me, are roots and wings.
Read this.
...and as they embark on this...
Vegetarian, non-vegetarian journey, yeah journey on which we send them with all our love and, and, and tremendous you know not obviously...
This is what the the young...
This is what the young make us remember...
And for them to reply "It's what I want, too "and there's nothing to be afraid of."
Evelyn and I would like to wish the two of you all the love and luck in the world.
And so say all of us.
Sonny and Sunaina!
If you really want to try monogamy, even though I think it's for the young and very naïve I suppose we could give it a go.
Norman?
You lied to me.
What about your wife?
Well that, that was true already.
You were my first since my husband died.
You weren't the first.
But I think you could be the last.
Please Chandrima.
Sonny told me.
I'm gonna kill that boy.
Thank you for coming.
You called.
Left or right, my lady?
Sorry?
When we reach the turning, do you want to go left or right?
What do you do when you're faced with a difficult decision?
I don't believe there is such a thing.
Throw a coin in the air and we always know which side we want it to land.
Left or right, my lady?
Are you in there, madam?
Did you forget your dancing shoes?
- No, madam.
- Then go and knock them dead.
Yes, madam.
Is there no-one on reception?
I thought this was a hotel?
- What are you doing here?
- Checking on my investment.
You've come to the wrong place.
I don't think so.
I couldn't find you at the party.
How are you, Mrs. Donnelly?
Why did you come here, really?
To pay my respects to you.
There's nothing I admire more than someone planting trees under whose shade they may never get to sit.
How long are you staying?
In which of your hotels do you think I should spend the night?
Second or the first?
I don't think you'll get a lot of sleep over there.
I know you'll understand me missing the reception and I hope you'll forgive me for not coming to say goodbye.
Go and have the honeymoon you deserve.
I'm sure there'll be somebody there to see you off.
There is no such thing as an ending.
Just a place where you leave the story.
And it's your story now.
I spent 40 years scrubbing floors and the last months of my life as co-manager of a hotel halfway across the world.
You have no idea now what you will become.
Don't try and control it.
Let go.
That's when the fun starts.
Because as I once heard someone say there's no present like the time.
As you may well know, I am many things.
An arts dealer, an accomplished fencer, fair shot with most weapons.
I am loved and respected by all who know me... slightly.
Would you mind?
The Qianlong vase.
Very, very rare.
Low-fired with an immersion glaze?
Why don't you test the vase instead?
I am sure that you will agree it is a bargain at two million pounds.
Everyone knows you're broke.
You will take one million.
Golly, that was a big one!
Well, have it your way, Fang.
One million pounds.
I trust that you have brought the treasuries?
You cheated me in our last deal.
I paid three million for that tapestry, then found out it is worth only one!
I'm an art dealer, not a charlatan.
Enough!
You owe me.
No!
Jock!
Jockie, thank heavens!
Where have you been, man?
Right behind you as always, sir.
Jock!
Well done, Jockie.
It's a privilege, sir!
Jock, you're ablaze!
- Well, I think our work here is done.
- Time to go, sir.
Jock laid out the state of our financial affairs.
We hurried back to Mortdecai Manor, where my beloved wife, Johanna, having heard of our financial distress, was arriving home to sell off some of my prized possessions.
Even my horsey picture was on the block.
But I was hopeful my new moustache would cheer her up.
Just a little something I cooked up whilst you were away, my darling.
I do believe it was Maggie Thatcher who said that kissing a man without a moustache is rather like eating an egg without salt.
- Oh, don't point that thing at me.
- Told ya.
I have put no inconsiderable thought and effort into this endeavor.
You see, the domain of a man's upper lip is his sovereign ground...
Oh, I happen to be terribly fond of it, and I have had every intention of seeing it through.
You mean it's going to get bigger?
It will come to fruition, yes.
Please, will you make up the guest bedroom for Mr. Mortdecai?
Already have, madam.
Very good, madam.
I do believe Jock has informed you that we are staring down the barrel of insolvency.
First thing we're doing is selling off that Sheridan.
We cannot go about selling off family heirlooms willy-nilly.
I'm afraid I shall have to put my foot down, darling.
Sorry?
With your permission, of course.
Bugger it.
A quick aside about Jock.
Recently, after we'd concluded the sale of a painting to a wealthy turkey farmer...
What was that?
- Get your head down, sir.
- What have you done now, man?
The farmer's daughter?
I only gave her the once-over.
- Where do you find the time?
- Sorry, twice-over.
Dear, sweet, simple Jock.
Every man should have a Jock, don't you think?
Meanwhile, not far away, our fortunes were about to become intertwined with one of the art world's greatest mysteries.
And a dead hag.
Bull's-eye.
Miss Bronwen?
Everything all right?
Get back behind the tape!
Who is this guy?
You and your men have done an admirable job stomping all over the place.
Your services are no longer required.
Sorry, Inspector Martland, sir.
Can I have all Thames Valley police officers back in their cars, please?
There's been a jurisdictional change.
No one knows the filthy underside of the art world better than he, sir.
He is the filthy underside.
Why did it have to be art?
Martland and I met at Oxford.
Once in a while I provide him with some off-the-record help with the seedier side of art collecting.
And in exchange, he gives me a wide berth to ply my craft.
He is also desperately in love with my wife.
Rather annoying, really.
What does that blighter want?
Tell him to ring back when my marriage isn't falling apart.
- No, he's here, sir.
- Don't get up.
- I wasn't going to.
Ignoring some of the more inviting bottles on the drinks tray, he reached underneath for the big decanter, and poured himself a gross amount of what he thought was my Taylor '31.
Score one for Mortdecai, for I had filled it with an invalid port of unbelievable nastiness.
- Oh, excellent.
- Score two.
Bit of cheese to go with that?
I should think the special one, Jock.
What is that infernal thing on your lip?
Is there a purpose to your presence?
You're in the hole to Her Majesty's government to the tune of eight million quid, old boy.
I had no idea I was so deep in Her Majesty's hole.
That's not natural.
What do you think?
I think this woman has need of a chiropractor.
Cheese.
Thank you.
Three months ago, a small Spanish museum sent her a Goya to be cleaned.
Why would MI5 be interested in the theft of a middling Goya?
- We don't know why.
But if Strago is involved, well, suffice it to say, it's a matter of urgent national security.
And you would like me to find it before he does?
Precisely.
Help me find that painting, or I'll have the magistrate open that file and prosecute at random.
It was a catalogue of some of my more unseemly escapades.
The file was fat and well-handled, like a Welsh barmaid.
- What's in it for me, as they say?
All right, Queen and Country, travel and living expenses, reasonable overhead.
Ten percent, sir.
And 10 percent of the insurance money as a finder's fee.
Done.
Oh, and incidentally, I asked for some cheese, not an instrument of biological warfare.
Score one for Martland.
Johanna, you look lovely.
Alastair.
- I thought that was you.
- Radiant...
Martland also met Johanna at school.
Johanna, do you...
Would you mind terribly, dear boy, the door?
Now, what's all this about a missing Goya?
Every Mortdecai man before me has had one.
And I will have you know that some members of the fairer sex do find it quite appealing.
Whom exactly?
No one in particular, of course.
I'd be delighted.
Do I detect a slight crack in the marital armor?
Well, good luck, mate.
I had the painting in my hand.
Someone must have known I was coming.
Then it must have been his dealer.
Krampf's dealer, what is his name?
Mortdecai.
You have no idea the beast you are about to receive.
Johanna?
Are you all right in there, darling?
- What is it?
- Moon of my delight.
This is your own personalized Sheik of Araby who seeks admission into your tent.
I have come to carry you off to the burning desert, and work my greasy will upon you... under the tropical stars.
Send your camel to bed, damn it!
My Sheik, does this mean you have excommunicated that moustache of the Prophet?
I'll trim it.
It's very difficult for me as well, you know, this thing that's come between us.
I know, darling.
I'm invested in it.
Why can't you invest in saving us from financial ruin?
Or do you want me to sort it out for you?
Heavens, no.
You needn't worry yourself.
I have things firmly... in hand.
Surely you mean the pubic hair above a vagina.
Go stuff a mattress with that thing!
The moustache, I mean.
Jockie, what if... it isn't just a tiff?
What if this is the well-known "it," as it were?
- That'd be awful.
Are you coming back to bed?
Yeah, give us a minute, love.
And myself sleeping alone.
How do you think this makes me feel, man?
I dunno, sir.
Dash it all, I am resolved.
If it is money we need, then it is money we shall have.
That's me.
- Yes, sir?
Do you think it will be all right in the end?
I couldn't say, sir.
Sir Graham has been the rudest man in England for years.
Recently, he's been working his way up to the wickedest.
Looks like something curled up and died on your lip.
It's not herpetic, I hope.
Hello, Sir Graham, you old member.
Who are you hiding in your belly?
I see you've put your Sheridan up in next week's sale.
What do you make of this Bronwen business?
You used her frequently, didn't you?
Not lately.
She's been unavailable for three months.
The Goya she was cleaning... rather simple job, wouldn't you say?
Usual dirt and grime one finds on the Spaniards.
Haven't the foggiest why it took her so long.
What's your sudden interest, if I may ask?
A client with a mild curiosity, that's all.
We must go shooting again.
Jock has fully recovered.
There's only one reason you might be interested in a museum-owned Goya, and that's because there's money involved.
You are mistaken, sir.
There's a great deal of money involved.
I've always admired your rapacity, sir.
Who's the client?
Terribly sorry, sworn to secrecy.
Perhaps a brisk walk down the stairs will do some good.
So it's that sort of Goya.
Romanov.
I want that painting.
So glad you called.
Oh, you remembered.
Thank you.
And in charge, thank you very much.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd pop 'round, and see how you secret agent men run the world.
It's not all chardonnay and afternoon trysts.
Is this a tryst?
How are things at home?
You've touched a nerve.
- Bit of a moron, actually.
- Maybe I should have an affair.
- Wouldn't that be funny?
- Hilarious.
Now, tell me, what are you and my husband working on at the moment?
- I really can't say.
This is interesting.
Johanna, I simply can't.
It was lovely to see you, Alastair.
Thank you ever-so-much for letting me confide in you.
I feel that I could share anything with you.
- Blackfriar's Hall.
- We must do this again.
Hello, Spinoza, you handsome devil!
It's a fine day to be alive, what?
You bloody chicken, bloody monkey, so good-for-nothing pot of piss, innit?
Spinoza, you silver-tongued scallywag.
You one book short of a library, you maggot?
And for your information, I am holding up a 50-pound note.
Never mind about that.
You should treat a jam jar car like this with more respect when you drive it down the frog and toad road.
Someone shooting at me!
I'm armed!
I should probably mention that this was not the first time I had shot Jock.
- Cover me, as it were?
- That's the old feudal spirit, Jock.
- Give me the painting.
That is a superb Hulihee sans sideburn, I must say.
Oh, well done.
Run, I shall, like a bloody gazelle!
The Mortdecai men have always been in tip-top shape, don't you know?
Fit as a fiddle!
Want to die...
No, I don't.
Sir!
I'm on the bonnet!
Get in the car, sir!
I don't like it!
Hello!
- Get in the back seat, sir!
Foreigner!
- Well done, Jock.
- It's a privilege, sir.
Didn't take long for you to make a mess of things.
Oh, you listen here, you do-gooder!
Your Emil Strago just killed my garage man and physically assaulted my person.
- He seems to think that I have the painting.
- What have you found?
Well, I will tell you that there is more here than meets the eye.
No painting takes three months to clean, so I believe that Bronwen was working on the Goya and discovered something underneath.
I've been helpin' out Miss Fellworthy goin' on five years now.
Just keepin' the place tidy and whatnot.
You have been grossly overcompensated.
Yeah, a Duke.
No help whatsoever, randy bugger.
Don't imbibe the crime scene.
I found her here, sprawled over the table, with an arrow out of her back.
- He was left-handed.
Jesus Christ.
Because I have a question for you, old bean.
Will I be given a badge, nestled in some sort of cheap, leather encasement, just like on telly?
These were found in her camera.
Which lady?
Well, the lady with the hair and brain.
I may have mentioned Bronwen to Johanna at lunch today.
You were luncheoning with my wife?
Horrible composition.
Lighting positively medieval.
This one taken by accident, utterly useless...
Hang on a tic.
- That is not your Goya.
- What do you mean?
That is not the same painting as the others.
Where have I seen that hand before in the background?
- To the library, chaps!
The Duchess of Wellington.
Bronwen has found the lost Goya.
Goya was commissioned by Charles IV of Spain to paint her in 1792.
She was said to be his greatest masterpiece.
Some say that Goya himself engineered the theft.
For 200 years, the painting was sought by collectors, craved by the mighty, and became the stuff of legend.
- And is the legend true?
- Does it matter?
The truth is nice, but a rumor is priceless.
What does Strago want with it?
If it does exist, it belongs to Spain.
If anyone tried to sell it, they'd be arrested on the spot.
Yes, well, that is where the story gets interesting, you see.
The Duchess pops up again in France in 1943, looted from some sealed room in an unpronounceable chateau by the jerrys.
Hermann Goering was said to have been obsessed with the painting, and there are rumors that he inscribed on it the codes to his numbered Swiss bank account.
Untold riches and all that, what?
It had vanished once again into history, and the secret bank accounts along with it.
- What are we talking about here?
- Hundreds and hundreds of millions, surrounded by all that Gruyere, chocolate, and fine wines.
Multiple attacks over the years to come, countless lives are at stake.
I sunk into an uneasy slumber, interspersed curiously with erotic dreams.
Lady Mortdecai, the Duke is expecting you.
This way.
Her Lady Mortdecai to see you, Your Grace.
The Duke of Asherboroughdon.
Lady Mortdecai.
You'll forgive me just a moment, I'm sure?
Of course.
Lady Mortdecai.
She's so damned attractive.
Water bailiff.
Had to speak to the water bailiff about my water.
Fishing tomorrow, you know.
Bloody nuisance.
- I'm very sorry.
No, I can't understand a word she says.
Poor Bronwen.
The painting, Your Grace.
- Bronwen?
- Must to the lavatory.
Would you care to come and take a peek at it?
An exquisite invitation, Your Grace, but I'm afraid I must decline.
- Let's get back to the Duchess.
Bunny rolled it up in a carpet and didn't tell a soul.
Do you think that Bunny still has the painting now?
Must to the W.C.
Do have a look?
I'm afraid I must be going, Your Grace.
Thank you very much for your time.
And you are?
The water bailiff, Your Grace.
Fishing tomorrow's been cancelled.
Thank heaven.
Oh, I see.
- Roman Romanov.
So I have him to thank for this.
Oh, that's unpleasant.
Where's the Goya?
Well, where is the last place you saw it?
Have you looked under your couch?
But why does everyone seem to think...
Milton Krampf tells everyone he is getting painting.
You're his dealer, so you have painting!
Dmitri, please to fetch 12-volt high-tension car battery.
I am afraid you are barking up the wrong Englishman, comrade.
Vladimir, please to take Mr. Mortdecai's trousers down.
Perhaps we can work something out.
Open your balls.
I shan't!
What does that even mean?
I'll go to 20.
That's not cricket!
Oh, Jock...
Jump!
Oh, dear, sweet, resourceful Jock.
Balls!
Forgive me, Vladimir.
No balls.
Thank you so much, Vladimir.
- I wish to use your telephone!
- Head toward the bike.
Have you heard the expression, "Open your balls"?
Hang on, sir!
Bloody good show, Jock!
You really are a cut above!
Where would you like to go, sir?
The only safe ground is English soil.
To the Embassy, chop-chop.
Keep your head down, sir!
- I couldn't say, sir!
No, not the stairs!
A bit of noise, sir!
- Oh, it was dashed exhilarating.
- Where to, sir?
- "Open your balls"?
- I have no idea.
Is it that you actually know and don't want to tell me?
Yes, sir.
- And his wife is on line six for you.
Thank you, Maurice.
Thank heavens.
This place is an absolute mausoleum on one's own.
No, I suppose not.
Still... if he can't make it, he can't make it.
May I bring anything?
Perhaps there is something you could bring.
A bottle of Chardonnay?
A complete regimental listing of the British 7th Army, 2nd Division, June of 1945.
- Very well, Johanna.
Well, maybe he won't be able to make it.
- Uppy, uppy, Jock!
Where are we?
You should see the other fellow.
The fact that you're as drunk as a fiddler's bitch in no way obviates the fact that you very nearly caused an international incident.
A man your age has no excuse for looking or behaving like a fugitive from a home for alcoholic music hall artistes.
- And the Ambassador's residence.
- And at the Ambassador's residence.
Are you suggesting that I go to the Colonies?
The sale of your Rolls-Royce to Krampf will offer you a perfect cover.
Find out if he's got that painting.
Get behind the gates of his estate and poke around a bit.
I should like to ring my wife because she's probably quite worried about me.
I say, old bean!
Go to America and see Krampf.
Do what it takes to bring the painting back, and leave Johanna to me.
Jock?
Come here.
Sorry, there was a queue.
Good God, man!
Focus, man!
- No, today's, what, Monday?
- Thursday, sir.
What kind of hell-place is this?
I feel as though we've made a wrong turn and arrived on the set of a pornographic film.
Have we taken a wrong turn and arrived on the set of a pornographic film?
Checking in?
I am Mortdecai, Lord of Silverdale.
I should like to request a bucket of ice, "Do Not Disturb" sign, and a bulldozer.
- Checking in?
- Yeah, we're checking in.
I suspect I may need to redecorate.
Room 326, overlooks the pool.
So all I must do is show up, and I'm presented with a credit card.
No wonder your country's in financial ruin.
Do you need help with your bags?
Strange country.
Hold it.
Thanks.
It's like listening to bloody orangutans!
Hello, American?
Good God, Jock!
Put that thing away, man!
It is I, your beloved.
Your husband, Charlie.
Where are you?
Well, what are you doing there?
Well, I'm delivering the Rolls to that grotesque Milton Krampf and retrieving a certain something in the process.
Oh, is he still alive?
Has he got the painting yet?
- Is that Martland?
Well, I think I'm staying in some sort of cement brothel, my love.
- Say that again.
- You look here, I will have you know that I too am capable of being desirable to a certain type of woman!
Some women go blind batting their lashes for mustachioed men such as I!
Charlie Mortdecai, you are on very dangerous ground!
Oh, balls.
I was hot on the scent, and a teensy bit curious about his nympho daughter.
Lucky saddle.
You must be Mortdecai.
Yes, indeed I am he.
Are you not having a little something to drink?
No, I never drink alcohol.
Oh, I feel wonderful.
Feel me.
- Charlie Mortdecai, you son of a bitch...
- I was not squeezing the breasts...
The Rolls.
Yes, but someone found out about the plan, and now Bronwen is as stiff as my Uncle Richard's hatband.
The expert brushstrokes, the smooth lines...
I never met your mother.
No, not in her, in me.
I was just looking for something... else.
I'm gonna unveil the Duchess, and watch every art world snob in town drool all over her.
And if you're quick about it, you might have time to couple with Georgina before dinner.
She's been through half the staff already.
Sir, you're staring at your liquor.
So I am.
Jock, I fear we are in the eleventh hour, man.
Our very future rests on getting our hands on that blasted painting.
During the party, we steal it while no one's looking.
Ingenious.
Once again?
You go down, get your face seen a bit... then you meet me 'round the back later, we climb up the side of the building, break through the window, grab the painting.
Oh, diabolical.
Let's review it a few more times, shall we?
Unremarkable.
- That's my bottom.
- Dance with me.
Have me.
Darling!
Whatever brings you here?
This is not a breast in my hand!
Oh, pleasantly.
Aren't you going to introduce us?
And she was, well, we were having a discussion about three...
Sometimes, you know, how it's like a...
My, my, look at the time!
Carry on!
Good hungry doggie...
I met a beast...
And what, pray tell, might you be doing whilst I'm engaged in thus heroics?
How I long for the rain and indifference of Europe.
- Well done, Jock!
- It's a privilege, sir!
Bad news for you, Strago.
There are no bank codes on that painting.
Stop right there!
Despite his man purse, Strago is very dangerous.
- Darling, they are in cahoots.
Oh, that's gross!
We are in love.
Drop the gun!
Emil!
- Alastair, what are you doing here?
- I followed you.
Wouldn't do to have you walking into all this mess on your own, now, would it?
Yes, most likely by accident.
None of you will ever know what it's like to make love to a man with principles.
It's the shellfish!
I go, I go, I go!
- Come on, let's go.
Well, at least none of us had the shellfish.
Jock, please!
My sympathetic gag reflex.
Have you lost your bearings, man?
Shellfish at a catered affair?
I will have you two know that I had a firm grasp on things before you showed up.
You certainly had a firm grasp on something!
You dare to cast aspersions?
I am not the one entertaining at all hours with a failed poet!
Oh, I've got a sensitive tummy!
There's more, there's more, there's more.
At least I have the good taste to hide my indiscretions and not parade them under everyone's nose!
I'm done.
There!
I shall secure the perimeter.
Why, this is an outrage!
Are you quite finished with your barrage of insults?
Now we heat the surface, reveal the codes and transfer the money.
Get the blowtorch.
Nobody make a move.
I really wouldn't, you know, he's trained and sexually frustrated.
Those bank codes won't fall into the wrong hands again.
Oh, dear.
The local authorities were displeased.
Strago and Georgina fled, leaving the rest of us to answer some rather pointed questions.
I recounted the sordid tale as best I could...
I suppose that we will have to open the house to tours.
I'll have Jock fix up the servants quarters for us.
Do you think that Jockie will stay on without pay or lodging?
Of course!
Bronwen makes a fake, and calls Krampf.
Spinoza then secrets the painting into the Rolls and I unwittingly smuggle it to Krampf.
Bunny.
The Duke is Bunny.
- And it wasn't his tadger.
- Come again?
The Duchess of Wellington is in Bunny's loo.
Well, the water bailiff won't bother him now.
- Terribly sorry for your loss, madam.
- How very kind.
Would you mind ever so much if we used the lavatory?
It's this way.
Oh, you beautiful breadwinner.
- Darling, please, you are killing me.
- Out the window with it?
What do we do next?
If it falls into Strago's hands, he will unleash his unpleasantness to disastrous effect upon the world.
And if we try to sell it to Romanov, he will kill us and simply take it instead.
And yet we must find a way to pay eight million in back taxes.
Quite, quite, yes, indeed, quite.
Just bear in mind, I'm standing on a loo, holding a dead man's Goya.
- Perfect.
We are going to enter the Goya into the auction, disguised as our Sheridan.
We'll make a switch.
But first we must convince our buyers that the Goya's back in play.
Then we'll show it to them.
What is all this nonsense?
You know I'm not interested in your flaccid Sheridan.
Darling?
Interested now?
Very.
- But I watched it burn.
- It's Mortdecai, sir.
Chatter is he's found a dashedly clever way to move it on the open market.
- The auction starts at 5:00 p.m.
I believe he still owes me a finger.
Good luck.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Sedgwick's Autumn Master's Sale.
We shall begin with Lot One.
Shall we start the bidding at 17,000 pounds?
Seventeen thousand pounds, thank you very much.
Stealthy, man, stealthy.
Like a jungle cat.
Hello, Vladimir.
So good to see you out and about.
Tell us where painting is, or you have big hole in your head.
You will have hole in your balls!
Why is Dmitri obsessed with testicula?
Probably less than a 20.
And they say she was dressed as a man at the time.
Sold to the gentleman in the fuchsia ascot.
Oh, dash it all, Jock, man, your hand!
It's all right, sir, I've got another.
You know, remarkably, this is not the first time I've shot Jock.
I'll meet you inside, sir.
And we move on to Lot Four.
Isn't it charming?
Give me the painting.
What painting?
I see that you have been schooled in the... fine art of fencing.
Alas, so have I.
An essential part of every gentleman's education.
Sold for 210,000 pounds.
And now, moving on to Lot Six.
Oh, dear.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you would please remain calm.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you would please remain in your seats, I would be grateful.
Where is Mortdecai?
Well, come on, then.
Going on to Lot Seven.
A lovely Sheridan offered by the Mortdecai estate.
Shall we start the bidding at 100,000 pounds?
Where is Mortdecai?
- Where is he?
- It's just me, mate.
Dear, sweet, heroic Jock.
Yes, well, in future, if you could please use your paddles.
I will take your finger.
I couldn't help overhearing some discussion about your finger.
Oh, don't worry about that, sir, I've got nine more.
I feel simply awful, man, but I must get to the auction.
- I'll be all right, sir.
- We need eight million.
A bid from Lady Mortdecai, who seems to be bidding on her own painting.
- Very well. 600 then.
I'll make it up to you, Jockie.
Well done, sir.
It is a privilege, Jock.
Are we all done at 900,000?
Go bid!
Fair warning at 900,000 pounds... from Sir Graham.
Last chance.
Ten million pounds.
Ten million pounds from Lord Mortdecai himself.
Twenty-five million.
Are we all done at 30 million pounds?
Sold.
There you are. 2,642 pounds.
Can you think of a good reason why I shouldn't arrest you right now?
I eschew discomfort?
Any blame here should fall on me.
Dear Alastair, if I led you to believe there was anything between us, it was merely to find out about the case and protect my husband.
Of course, Johanna.
It was a damned good try, old bean.
Thank you, Maurice.
Magnificent.
Do you think the codes are really there?
They most certainly are, darling.
And I gave them to the authorities.
Anonymously, of course.
We may be flat broke, my darling, but we are not desperate.
I do hope Romanov doesn't come down too hard on Sir Graham, when he finds out he bought the wrong fake.
Lights.
Open your balls.
Bollocks.
Now... tell me about that tramp on the horse.
It's a terrible moment when you find yourself falling in love with your own spouse, isn't it?
Now, that is the look that softens every bone in my body, except one.
Do you mean you are ready?
I see no obstacle to such a course.
My love, surely you recall I have already been circumcised.
I deeply, deeply love... my moustache.
Proceed.
Would you really do that for me?
For you, there is nothing I would not do.
Really?
Try me.
It's been nine months.
I'm having dinner.
With Garrett?
Honestly, Vicky, sometimes I think you're rooting against us.
Who's "us"?
You and me, or you and him, because I kinda thought that was done.
He's the father of my kid.
Who cheats with the secretary every time he goes to the home office.
He said she smelt like chocolate chip cookies.
Because it's burned in my mind.
And for your information, he doesn't go to San Francisco anymore.
I'll help you.
One, two, three!
Dad, thank you so much.
Let's do cake.
What are you guys doing for Labor Day?
Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Please?
When were you thinking of going?
I get back from a business trip the Thursday before Labor Day.
Business trip?
Where?
No, I meant where is your business trip?
Claire, it doesn't matter.
So, you know, you guys should just keep it a guy trip.
You'll have a blast.
Kevin!
Mom, the door is jammed.
He's not gonna tell you anything any different.
Okay, you ready, Mom?
I got n.
I can fix that for you if you want.
And you are?
Claire.
He's hereto help me when I get the, uh' bone marrow transport.
I can, uh, lake a look at this real quick.
Mom?
He seems like a nice boy.
Yeah, he is.
You up for some coffee?
So, the entire time, it was the clutch.
Almost 20.
My uncle, actually, my great-uncle, uh, he needed help, I needed a change, so I figured I'd go back to school here.
She seems way too cool to be a teacher.
Just go on and talk to her.
And say what?
My dad's making my brother and me do split shifts to earn gas money.
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm friends with Kevin here.
I'm gonna go look around.
So, you're having a good day?
Hey, check it out.
Okay, all right, fine, fine.
Hey, Noah, are you ready to go?
Uh, Allie, how much is this gonna be?
You thirsty?
Yeah.
Hey, there was this kid at the hardware store giving him a hard time.
Jason Zimmer?
Um, skater kid, red hair, permanently dumb look on his face?
That would be the one.
Kept on calling him "The Whiz."
He actually had an incident a couple of years ago on a playground where he got stung by a bee, and his throat swelled up and he panicked and lost control.
You can trust me.
Anyways, uh, you're all set.
It works!
Thank you.
Um, how long will your uncle be in the hospital?
Well, until he's better, you can come over for dinner here anytime, okay?
You are not an imposition.
Oh, no, dude, you don't wanna do that.
In the classics.
Back in San Bernardino, we were studying the Odyssey.
You want me to help you outwith that?
You're kidding, right?
Second that.
Dude, you gotta read the Iliad.
"A pitiful excuse for a king."
Well, because to him they were justified.
Homer's a genius, my man.
Oh, hey, Noah, come on in.
You know, Kevin already left.
Actually, I, uh, picked something up for you.
Oh, my God, this is a first edition?
One man's trash."
Claire, please!
Thank you.
Why?
Those kind of shoes are for women trying to be sexy.
Where are you?
Almost there.
Well, hurry up!
Two, take off your wedding ring.
And the closer I get to this car, the smell is getting stronger and stronger.
You did not tell me that.
The classics.
It's fancy.
I mean, I don't know how many kids nowadays are going to use what they learn from classics.
No offense.
Silly me, I just want them educated.
I'm fine with education, but we gotta get them working.
You know, money's fine, except when it's motivated by greed.
Firecracker?
Is that how you regard women with an opinion?
Only when they disagree with mine.
Pleasure to meet you, Benny.
J. K. Rowling.
I'm sorry?
Do you think it's still cool to eat the cooked part?
I mean, that date was awful.
What?
Amazing.
And sweet, natural and sexy.
So sexy.
Noah!
Just once.
Hey, you're having second thoughts, it's normal.
This isn't normal, okay?
Nothing about this is normal.
Where's my coat?
Would you just stop for one minute'?
Look, Noah, I don't want you to think that any of this was your fault, okay?
I wasn't thinking clearly, okay?
It was more than that.
God damn it!
Because it's true.
And in time, you're going to see it, too.
Just leave.
Mom, we caught seven trout.
Yeah, he was, uh, pretty amazing.
Dad?
And eat off the shovel?
Yeah, well, the foil-covered shovel.
It was a great meal.
It was delicious.
This was great.
I'll get ii.
You want any coffee?
Yeah, I'll have some if you are!
I feel like I know you, he talks about you so much.
Told me about the alternator you put in the truck.
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.
Hey, Noah.
Wow, looks perfect.
But it's, like, 8:30.
I'll walk outwith you, Mr. Peterson.
Oh, I'm going to stay around awhile, thanks.
Well, you know, I'll walk out with you, Noah.
They're great, right?
Nice kid.
You know, we need to figure out what we're doing here, Garrett.
I mean, we're in limbo here and maybe, you know, it's just time to move on.
I'm not seeing her anymore.
But you might as well be, because I'm always going to think you are and I don't want to live that way.
And you shouldn't want to live that way, either.
We both checked out.
Haven't you ever made a mistake?
Don't throw our marriage away because I made a mistake.
All right.
Come on.
Welcome, everybody, to the start of a brand-new year.
Mrs. Peterson.
Principal Warren, what a nice surprise.
I think it was Achilles who said that, right?
I'm confused.
Your transfer request said, yeah, that he'd be an asset to the class.
This was your email.
Stop following me!
Kevin!
Did you send an email from my account to Principal Warren?
No, why?
Because somebody did.
It sounds like you've been hacked.
You should really change your password.
You know, I'd be happy to help you outwith that, if you want.
No, thanks.
Kevin!
Noah, can you give us a second, please?
You can wait for him outside.
You're the one who told him he could be and he's coming to dinner tonight.
My Uncle Bob was a tail gunner in Korea, and a sergeant in Vietnam.
Tough old dude.
Now he's laying in Valley Memorial, hoping the transplant takes.
Here, you got that?
Like a dinner and a camping trip can just make you forget about how he walked out on you.
So, he picks up a younger woman and poof!
Whole new life.
Go ahead and aim.
Almost.
Like computers.
You follow me?
It is what it is.
Tell him about your computer class.
He's learning how to write his own software.
Like father, like son.
Going out for boxing now.
How would you know?
You just can't come back in here and expect to pick up, like nothing happened!
Hey, uh, how was dinner with your dad?
Let's just take a break, all right'?
No, keep going!
God, I was a jerk, okay?
I feel really bad about it.
We just have to hope that your mom doesn't fall for it.
You know, someone he screws in the meantime.
Hey, uh, come on.
Someone he screws in the meantime?
Calm down!
God damn it!
Shit!
Is it working?
You good?
Garrett's coming on a little strong, don't you think?
What makes you think they're from Garrett?
Ifs way more fun worrying about you.
Make him grovel just a little bit, I swear...
Hey!
No, never.
They're beautiful, Garrett.
Flowers?
What flowers?
Claire?
You know what, I'm going to call you back.
I need to talk to you.
I'm busy with physical education.
They were a peace offering.
Do you know what that looks like?
A student sending a teacher flowers?
That's why I didn't sign the card.
And you hacked my email?
You said I could be in your class.
And you're trying to turn Kevin against his father!
You can't blame me for the trouble your cheating ex-husband has brought upon himself.
Stop it!
Thank you.
Everything okay, Claire?
Look, I just want us to start over, Noah, okay?
Can we do that, please?
So, deal?
Yeah, um, I need four three-eighth hex head bolts, nuts and washers.
And I need an air filter for a 201 2 Silverado Z71.
And I need you to go to a movie with me.
But I don't have a date to the Fall Fling.
Uh, me neither.
Like, really, really, um...
Great?
Yeah, great.
It is stupid.
I just want you to know, I'm not giving up on us.
Well, I want you know that I'm not asking you to.
What?
Why are you doing this?
Because you're a fucking liar!
What is wrong with you?
I'm seeing things clearly now.
You have to stop!
Hey, Noah, what's going on?
Game on.
Mom, what just happened?
What are you talking about?
You're just going to have to trust me on this one.
See you at school.
Hey, Peterson!
It's like the black version of The Wizard of Oz.
The Wizards of Waverly Place are on tomorrow.
Noah, stop!
Whatever.
I said sit down!
You know what I see?
Because all she really is is a dried up, dirty, fucking cunt.
You're gone' you're expelled!
Kevin, you don't want to keep her waiting.
Come on, you're going to be late!
Mom, we're going to get there too early, nobody's even going to be there.
Okay, how do I look?
Like the handsomest man on Earth.
Mom, come on, please, stop.
Seriously, come on, tonight has gotta be perfect, all right?
Because Allie Callahan's the most beautiful girl in school and I just never thought she'd actually go out with me.
Okay, please, stop.
Well, she obviously knows quality when she sees it.
Thanks.
Mrs. Peterson?
Anybody in there?
We need to talk.
Your behavior has been completely unacceptable.
My behavior?
And I'm not going to stand for it.
Just let me go.
So, what, your shit-head husband comes crawling back and you're just done with me?
You think you can scare me with some graffiti on the wall?
Think again!
It's going to be your word against mine!
And stay away from my son!
Sorry, guys.
Good morning!
What's going on?
She locked us out.
Mrs. Peterson, open this door!
Mrs. Peterson!
Open this door now!
Mrs. Peterson, I'm coming in!
Oh, I'm sorry, Ed.
Oh, I just had a personal call.
You guys take your seat, okay?
Your behavior lately has raised a lot of eyebrows.
Mike said that you got physical with him, that you put your hands on him.
Now, you know what our policy is regarding the use of physical force on students.
Well, I would hardly say I was using physical force!
Hey, Kev!
What?
I told your mom I'd pick you up today.
Because I think it's time for you to drive this bad boy.
I guess.
Come on, buddy, slow down.
You like to drive fast, isn't that right?
I mean, why else get a car like this?
Unless you're trying to be something that you're just completely not.
Kevin, slow down!
Do you have any idea what that was like when you were gone?
You didn't see her, Dad, okay.
Oh, no!
It's not braking!
Hit the brakes!
It's not working!
Punch it!
I'm so sorry!
Kevin!
Hey, we're in here watching TV.
Yeah, there's plenty of room.
I gotta unpack the groceries.
I'm gonna get something else to munch on.
You took pictures!
I'd rather fuck you.
You're fucking crazy!
Who should I show it to first?
No!
Yeah?
Do you want a soda?
Yeah, anything for you, Garrett.
I'll leave the light on.
Noah?
Hey, you're early.
Where's the damn video?
Why are you so angry?
We're going to go on family vacations together?
What do you think is going to happen here?
Wait.
If you let me show you what's possible.
Oh, Claire.
Okay, why didn't you tell me?
I thought that I could handle it.
And there's a video.
I'm not gonna let that happen, and neither are you.
Get the hell out of there, you got five minutes max!
Just a hunch.
What?
Run, hide!
Hey, Mom, what's with the knife?
You guys have to spend the night with me, out here, okay?
Ethan, uh, said you wanted to take a look at the Sandborn case.
They were on a back road outside San Bernardino.
Tire marks indicated the driver had lost control of the car.
The crash killed both passengers instantly.
And it was ruled an accident?
Why was that?
Well, he had a long history of dui's.
Well, Mrs. Peterson, even if his brakes went out, there was no indication of malfeasance.
This is the Sandborn car.
If you don't need anything else...
Thank you.
Hey, Noah.
Are you home?
Yeah, what's up?
Well, I'm over here working on Vicky's tractor.
You're at Vicky's?
Just get over here.
Let me just start off by saying I'm sorry.
No, really, lam very, very sorry, Vice Principal Lansing.
See, I've got a bit of a temper.
There's no denying that
And sometimes, it gets the best of me.
Like, when I feel like I'm being bullied.
And no one likes to be bullied, Vicky.
Can I call you Vicky?
See, my guess, Vicky, is that, uh, you don't like to be bullied.
I mean, who would?
Now, the two of you, with your little secrets.
Trying to make me think that you were her' so she could do what?
Something sneaky?
Vicky?
on, my God!
You killed Vicky!
When I love somebody, I protect them.
That's what heroes do.
No heroes kill their mothers and fathers!
I would never ever hurt my mother.
I loved my mother, but she killed herself.
Now, let's go.
Kevin!
I love your mother.
Just steady your breathing, baby!
And honestly, I'd hoped you'd see me as a mentor who cared about you more than your cheating father ever did.
It's gonna be okay.
You know, I was going to take Kevin with us.
No, he's not like his father at all.
All right.
Form our own family.
Please, Noah!
There's still time.
We will never be here again!
You can't do this!
I'm sick and tired of everyone going back and forth!
Take Kev and get out of here!
There is nothing I wouldn't do for you.
You can trust me.
But, Noah, you can't trust me!
Sorry, buddy, but sometimes even heroes have to make tough choices.
You're no hero!
And then we're gonna go home.
Previously on "Wayward Pines"...
Idaho?
Could have been much worse.
It was a nasty car accident.
- Theresa, there's been an accident.
So, what exactly are you doing here, Mr. Secret Agent Man?
Missing person's investigation.
- What happened to Evans?
- He tried to escape.
I don't have answers for you, Ethan.
You should go.
Kate, I'm in trouble.
It's just a town.
You didn't make it too far, did you?
Put your hands on top of the hood.
Look, I'm a government agent.
Yeah, and Mary Poppins is your grandmother.
You're a guy with no I.D., no badge, who just stole that car!
Get up on your feet.
You see, I called the Seattle Secret Service Office.
They've never heard of you.
Who did you talk to over there?
I don't care what you think you got!
If I want your help, I will ask for it.
Otherwise, you stay in that hotel room.
That's rule number one.
I did.
You know, you seem to be the, uh, manager here.
The Wayward Pines Chronicle, yes.
No, I guess not.
Breaking and entering is a major felony in the Gem State.
Now, maybe you can't understand that, being a one-man operation and all.
What were you just doing when I walked in here?
I saw some mud and some pines needles on the bottom of his boots.
He might have been killed in the woods and brought here afterwards.
Yeah, that was already in my report.
What's his body still doing here?
I hope you haven't tainted my crime scene.
No, the flies already took care of that.
Come on.
You said he tried to escape.
I was supposed to escape with him.
I found it.
But I'll go get it.
- Thanks.
- Oh, hey, Stan.
Bye, Mr. Burke!
You've reached the Burkes.
Sorry we aren't here to take your call, unless you're a telemarketer, and then we are thrilled to have missed your call.
Secret Service.
Yeah, Ethan Burke for Adam Hassler.
He's not available at the moment.
Is there something I can help you with?
- Is this Marcy?
If I said I would give him the message, then I'm sure I did.
Are you sitting at the seventh-floor reception desk at the Seattle Office?
All set, Mr. Burke.
You must know just about everybody in this town.
And almost everything about them.
Do you know where I might find Kate Hewson?
Oh, yeah, I should have called.
Things got a little complicated at work.
Really?
Anybody I know?
I love you.
Okay, get a room.
Because it's classified while... while they investigate, sweetie.
Unless he's with that woman again.
Which would be worse?
To what do I owe the pleasure?
I just thought I'd stop by and say "hi."
That was so nice of you.
How are you today?
I'm great, I think.
I haven't been able to get ahold of anybody since I got here, and I can't leave.
And the only reason that I'm here is because I was sent here to find you and Bill Evans.
But other than that, I couldn't be happier.
What happened to him, Kate?
And what happened to you?
Ethan, I don't think you've formally met my husband.
No, not formally.
Nice to meet you formally.
We kept it intimate.
Yeah, so did we.
What wrong with this money, Kate?
The date on every bill is 1988 or earlier.
What are you hiding?
Would you like me to wrap this up?
What happened to Evans?
It really is so sad about Bill Evans, especially for his widow.
Patricia.
I don't think she's left the house since he died.
I used to see her every morning, watering her pink hydrangeas in front of their light brown house.
Patricia has a real way with flowers.
"Do not try to leave.
"Do not discuss the past.
"Do not discuss your life before.
Always answer the phone if it rings."
Ballinger Toys.
Are you Mrs. William Evans?
Yes, I am.
You are?
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Do you mind me asking how long you and Bill were married?
Almost a year.
Well, I don't mean to alarm you, Mrs. Evans, but there's no record of Bill ever having been married.
Look, I'm alone with a newborn baby, so if you'll excuse me.
We're not gonna do this again, are we?
Let me look in my magic 8 ball and find out.
Find any suspects, Mr. Burke?
Because I found one.
Like somebody else in this room.
You haven't spent any time in there at all.
I hear you paid Patricia Evans a visit.
Here the poor woman is grieving over her dead husband, and you go banging on her door like a drunken Bible salesman.
I didn't know Evans was married with a baby.
You think the baby did it, huh?
Any word from Forensics?
They picked up your friend's body about an hour ago.
They said they should have results back by tomorrow morning.
His wife says he killed himself.
In the hospital.
I want you to stay away from the body.
Leave it to the professionals.
Let me know what the coroner says.
I thought you worked upstairs.
I go where I'm needed.
Were you able to reach your wife?
I know you really wanted to talk to her.
Ben, Theresa!
Where are they?
Who?
Mr. Burke, no new patients have been admitted since you left.
We lost track of you the other night before I had a chance to treat your brain hemorrhage.
We've been very concerned.
I just saw them!
I'm not saying you didn't.
You miss them a lot, don't you?
Mr. Burke... every second, your condition is worsening.
Have you noticed anything else go unexplained?
Nurse, would you get his charts, and then we can get started?
Thank you, Nurse.
We are doing everything that we can.
Except anything that could embarrass the Agency, and in the meantime, he could die if he isn't dead already.
I'm sorry, Adam.
How's Ben holding up?
Theresa, I can't...
I can't believe you went to the hospital.
Maybe you do have brain damage.
Get this.
It's some kind of... escape plan.
Well, before we do anything, we're gonna have to take out your microchip.
My what?
Can't they track us in here?
I've hidden in here before with the chip.
Okay, now put it in your pocket so they don't know you removed it.
You'll ditch it as soon as we run.
This is the same technology they use to track animals.
You got anything to close this wound?
Just duct tape.
You're gonna come up with a plan.
If I could come up with a plan, I would have left a year ago.
Who was your president?
Bill Clinton.
There's no names, dates.
The more you see, the less anything makes sense in this town.
I remember walking around in this fog with no competing memories.
Didn't take me too long to realize that it was the fear that keeps everybody in line here.
Fear of what?
Sheriff Pope.
He cut his throat while the whole town watched.
What the hell are you doing?
I haven't seen a single airplane the whole time I've been here.
Now, look who it is.
We'd love that.
See you then.
I'm going to Boise.
What?
No, in the morning.
Either Ethan is dead or he has abandoned his family, and I'm gonna find out which one it is.
And if it is the latter, then I am going to kill him myself.
Oh, can I help?
Yes, you can stay with Ben.
Well, he's a wild one, that's for sure.
I heard he's been here quite a bit.
He's probably got a little thing for you, Beverly.
I don't think so, okay?
He has a wife, and he misses his wife a lot.
But not about the past.
Nice house you got here.
I hope I never see this house again.
You trust me, don't you?
Look, I've known Kate for a long time, and right now, I don't trust her any more than you do.
But if we skip out on this dinner, they're gonna know something's up.
They're not gonna catch on to us... as long as we stick to the plan.
That's almost hard to believe.
Harold's specialty is rocking horses.
Back in Portland, my daughter has a rocking horse.
Oh, I didn't know you had a daughter.
Harold, how did you get into woodworking?
Will you excuse me?
Yes!
You know, she was complaining about an upset stomach earlier, but don't let it interrupt your dinner.
You know what I mean, Harold?
I'm sorry, look...
- Sure.
What did you do with the chip?
Listen, promise me one thing.
Beverly Brown tried to leave.
As I've said many times before it is not just my job to keep this town safe.
It's everybody's!
She deserved it!
Nowadays, the US government can listen to anything you say.
They know where you are, they know who you're talking to, and trust me, they know who you're fucking.
You turn on a cell phone or a computer, and you're doomed.
But in Colombia in 1989, it wasn't that easy.
On top of that, the only people who had sat phones were the filthy rich... the landowners, the politicians...
And lucky for us, the narcos were richer than them all.
What's up, Lizard?
We're going out tonight.
And once you got a signal, you didn't know who you were listening to.
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen.
Hammer, prepare to engage.
Once we got a target, we still had to locate it.
So we had to triangulate their signals using assets on the ground.
Hawkeye, how do you copy that?
Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.
La Dispensaria.
I've got a table ready.
Show up around midnight.
Negative on Hammer.
This fuckwad just told us where he's going.
Hammer, disengage.
So who do we give this to?
By "the other guy," he meant me.
I'm Steve Murphy, Drug Enforcement Agent.
And as you can see, I am deeply embedded in Colombia.
I would've loved to go after Poison myself, but the DEA is restricted in a foreign country.
- La Dispensaria?
Guess who that was.
Your partner.
He just gave me a great gift.
Poison.
He's not a fool.
Gotta go.
Gonna stick me with the bill?
Cheap son of a bitch.
In case you're wondering, this is the asshole.
Javier Peña, my partner.
And this is Colonel Carrillo, the leader of the Search Bloc, the unit we helped create to capture the bad guys.
Boy, did he have a lot of love for the narcos.
Especially the local hitmen.
Colombians call them sicarios.
- What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.
- Let's go inside and have a good time.
Now, Poison, he was one of the best.
I don't have a lot of love for the narcos either.
It's on, boys!
We're gonna stop on 14th and go around the corner.
Riano, Trujillo, you're in the front with me.
Yeah, I pushed the buttons.
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.
People forget, but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.
We thought he was one of the good guys.
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet was a good guy because he hated the commies.
So we helped Pinochet seize power.
Then Pinochet turned around and killed thousands of people.
- Maybe not such a good guy after all.
But sometimes, bad guys do good things.
Nobody knows this, but back in '73, Chile was on its way to being the world's biggest cocaine processing and exporting center.
How many times do I have to tell you not to waste the acid?
They had deserts to hide the labs and miles of unpatrolled coastline to ship the product north.
You're surrounded!
- What the fuck is going on here?
And then, being Pinochet... he had them all killed.
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno, aka Cockroach, and he was smart enough to play dead.
He wasn't killed on that day.
Instead, he won the damn lottery.
Cockroach had been stealing from his bosses for months.
Fucking Pinochet is killing the whole world.
- But you're not a communist.
- No, not a communist, something worse.
A drug trafficker.
A rat will choose cocaine over food and water.
It would choose cocaine over sleep, over sex... over life itself.
The human brain isn't quite the same as a rodent's... unless we're talking about cocaine.
Cockroach knew he had the perfect product.
And the best smugglers in the world were in Colombia.
- A typical Colombian smuggling family.
Another possible partner was José Rodríguez Gacha, nicknamed "The Mexican," for his love of tequila and sombreros.
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade, even by Colombian standards.
And sometimes, your partners.
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade had made Gacha too hard.
The man who would change my life forever.
Pablo was making a killing in the smuggling business.
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, you name it.
At the time, Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.
They didn't play by the same rules.
Pablo Escobar?
Where's Felipo?
Felipo's been arrested.
- Do you know who you're talking to?
Show some respect.
Now what's the problem, Mr. Jose Luis?
How do you know my name?
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.
And that's Nacho Ibarra.
I don't have all day.
Open it.
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.
You need papers for these TV sets.
Take them.
Your son.
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?
Hey, Pinilla!
Your daughter just got her driver's license, right?
What's she doing with a guy like you?
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?
Why don't I have my boys drop off a few gifts?
Colonel, how is your mom doing?
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
My eyes are everywhere.
That means you guys can't move a finger in all of Antioquia without me knowing about it.
Do you understand?
Now, you can stay calm and accept my deal... or accept the consequences.
Silver... or lead.
You decide.
All right, yesterday we were talking, and I think this business can make us a lot of money.
Explain.
I will handle the chemical part of production, and all the other details in producing this exquisite white powder.
What I need from you is to help me get it into Colombia.
- Now tell him how much it costs.
In Chile, this little thing costs ten bucks a gram.
- They sell it by grams?
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla, Cali, Cartagena...
We're going to be rich.
- What did you say your name was?
Well look, Cuca... you don't have any vision, my friend.
If it costs ten dollars a gram here... imagine how much it will sell for in Miami.
- I love that song.
Back then, Miami was a paradise.
I signed up for the sand, surf and women.
In '79, the bad guys I was chasing wore flip-flops.
Kevin was a little slow afoot.
How much money you owe me?
How 'bout her?
No, no, no, we gotta fuck with him.
- You dicking me around?
How you doing?
Busy.
Yeah, those bastards got me.
But I couldn't let it end like that.
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?
How about a fake number?
That'll work.
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?
Have a good night.
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!
So it wasn't a fake.
I thought you might figure it out.
After all, you're DEA.
And just like that... she had me.
The minute Pablo laid his eyes on the paste-processing labs in Peru, cocaine had him.
Little magic leaves.
The kerosene separates the drug from the leaf.
Over here, the sulfuric acid distills and distills it.
Then you cut it, and mix it with gasoline.
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise out of the liquid.
Let it dry, dry, dry.
Here is the prize.
It's like the kitchen in your house.
Like baking a cake.
Only a much better cake than you've ever had.
Look, an old press, an antique.
Now we put it in the oven.
We'll take five.
How do we get five across the border?
That's Gustavo's department.
This one has got a good engine.
I was taking a look at it, and the best place to hide the merchandise would be under the rear wheel well.
It's 22 and one half horsepower.
Is this easy to take off?
- Sure, when do you need them?
All right, we'll take the cars and head back to the lab.
Why the fuck are we going back to the lab?
Because there are four wheel wells per car and that's 20 kilos.
- For three cars, that's 60 kilos.
So if it's nine dollars profit per gram, what?
That's half a million dollars... per trip, using the same smuggling routes he always used.
Easiest money he ever made.
Back in Medellín, Pablo didn't waste any time.
He bought a house in his old neighborhood and opened his first lab to turn Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.
How are you feeling, Gustavo?
All this smells like shit to me.
The stinkier, the better.
All right.
What about all these lights?
Is that to tip off the cops, or what?
Just worry about transporting the stuff and selling it.
I'm the artist here, clear?
But make no mistake, it would change Medellín forever.
You know the thing that has me worried, Pablo?
Don't you think the workers will choke with all that smoke?
Let's build them a chimney.
Gentlemen, the first three?
If this business makes so much money, why are you sending me coach?
Like her son, Pablo's mother Hermilda was very resourceful.
Hey, Mom, how much do you think we can fit in there?
It's Gustavo.
Five kilos, right?
Pablo loved his young bride Tata, and she loved him.
He was a family man till the end.
Here's three.
We're going to need two more, right, Mom?
- That's right.
- Pablito... make sure it is not you who wears it, OK?
Try it on.
That's it.
Good, right?
...three.
- Like a fag model, isn't that right?
The Lion was one of the first guys to ever bring coke into Miami.
Next, please.
I got it in Colombia and look, it has a little gift.
I was in jail for a while, remember?
What you got there is the perfect product.
Pablo says the gringos will fall in love with this shit.
Here you go.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna get another jacket, brother.
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow, all right?
The Lion made more than 20 flights between Medellín and Miami.
Drugs in, cash out.
And the rich and famous in Miami snorted every single gram of it.
And in no time, Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.
Gustavo had the trucks filled to the brim with potatoes, the major item Colombia imported from Peru.
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.
The coke paste was hidden in the spare tires.
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.
Pretty soon, the Lion had to come up with new ways to smuggle the drug to Miami.
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?
You guys are pilots, so you can get this stuff by without a problem.
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo, so whatever you want.
We'll take four.
All right, much better.
Come in, please.
Look, here are the packets.
You girls are pregnant, right?
That's good, because US Customs won't search pregnant women.
You two can easily swallow 70 instead of 50.
And I'll pay you $15,000 to help you with the kids.
During the early '80s, most flights out of Bogotá had several mules on them.
Getting in was easy, because nobody worried about cocaine in America.
All we cared about was grass.
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in almost every legitimate Colombian export.
But even that didn't do it.
The real game changer was filling Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.
Do you trust this guy?
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.
But he's got good routes.
Smooth.
- How far?
- How much more?
About... 300 more.
It was a real milestone in the story of narcotics, folks.
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen and started opening cocaine labs in the middle of the jungle.
Under the canopy cover of the Colombian rainforest, he could expand his production capability indefinitely without anybody noticing it.
We brought you a little present.
Brazilians.
Best asses in the world, believe me.
No, I'm not feeling well.
Pablo couldn't hide his success from his friends.
How something like this can make so much money!
What do you think, Pablo?
I heard the "potato" business is like the "egg" business.
I wouldn't get involved.
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.
We can reduce the cost of the refining process if we buy together.
Well, guys, the hard part is getting the merchandise to Miami.
You need a lot of creativity for that.
How much would you charge us to be "creative"?
You deliver the product to me, labeled.
I will take it to Miami and deliver it to your contact there.
Better yet, Lehder will do it.
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value, but I'll insure the safety of your load up to 50 percent of the value.
Deal.
Sounds good to me.
Partners?
We know your policy toward partners.
To Miami.
When I started, a one-kilo grass bust was cause for celebration.
And before long, we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.
We thought we were making a huge difference.
Truth is, we weren't even making a dent.
They let us have 60 so they could bring in 600.
Pablo's coke flooded in.
And with the money... came the violence.
The hippies had been replaced by Colombians, and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.
The Miami coroner said Colombians were like Dixie cups.
Use 'em once, then throw 'em away.
The Dade County morgue couldn't fit all the bodies from the drug war.
They had to rent a refrigerated truck from a local company to hold all the extra corpses.
That was the first person I ever shot.
A teenager not old enough to buy a six-pack.
Hey... it was self-defense.
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.
Did he forget to tell you the kid was 17?
He sells drugs, right?
What happened?
Stay with me.
I have an unconscious pregnant female.
Paramedics said she collapsed after she got off her flight.
By the time she got to us, she was barely breathing.
- I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine but she had no residue on her nostrils, no injection marks.
I'm so sorry.
She was body-packing 11 ounces of cocaine.
Two of the pellets split open.
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.
No one survives that.
Why won't Pablo ever see me?
I spent all this time waiting around for him.
Tell me something, Cockroach.
Did you ever think you were going to have this much money?
If it wasn't for me, you two would still be smuggling cigarettes.
Let me give you a piece of advice.
Never say that to Pablo.
He's not as forgiving as I am.
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.
But Cockroach should've listened to Gustavo.
Instead, he found another way to get his fair share.
What do you have in the spare tires?
Gustavo, what do you mean "we lost it"?
Just what I said, we lost it.
Look... we've paid every cop from here to Ipsalia.
So how did we lose a load, brother?
And how much is he asking?
Too much.
What are you going to do?
Come back, Pablo.
Where are you going, Pablo?
What's going on, brother?
What if I shot you in the head?
Are you sure about this, Colonel?
He hasn't stopped laughing since we arrested him.
- We're DAS, Ibarra.
What's that faggot gonna do?
There we are.
No, lower, lower.
- Pablo didn't know it then but this mug shot was gonna cause him a lot of grief down the line.
Remove the handcuffs.
You can go now, officer.
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.
We counted more than 300 kilos in those trucks.
That's a street value of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.
And you only gave us $150,000.
Well, that's what we agreed upon.
You know something?
I make deals for a living.
Or we can renegotiate, come to an agreement, and everyone goes home happy.
Deal?
I'll give you one million dollars... under one condition.
What is it?
Someone in my organization gave you the street value of my cocaine.
Otherwise, how would you know?
Give me a name... and you won't have to split the cash with him.
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.
Not only did he sell Pablo to the authorities, he was stealing from him all along and selling his coke in Miami, too.
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata, a Colombian with a plumbing business that served as a front for his cocaine operation.
The plan was to trade vehicles, and Zapata would be arrested once he left the port.
1200 kilos.
That would get us on the cover of the Miami Herald.
OK, gringos.
How's the plumbing business?
Fine.
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.
In the case of the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz, after taking into account all due considerations, bail has been set at two million dollars, or a bond of $200,000.
I got to the courthouse early the day of La Quica's trial.
My testimony was gonna put that bastard on death row.
La Quica boarded and was back in Medellín by midnight.
What got the US government to take notice was the money.
Billions of dollars a year, all flowing from the US to Colombia.
Or... maybe they were pissed off that they weren't getting a cut.
Whatever it was, the businessmen came at just the right time.
Drugs are menacing our society.
They're threatening our values and undercutting our institutions.
They're killing our children.
It was classic Reagan.
Folksy, direct and tough.
He vowed to go after drugs at the source.
But it was Nancy who stole the show.
So to my young friends out there, life can be great.
But not when you can't see it.
So open your eyes to life, to see it in the vivid colors that God gave us as a precious gift to His children.
Say yes to your life.
They say when a nuclear holocaust destroys the world, only the cockroaches will survive.
During his career, Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.
But I wouldn't learn that till later.
My dad volunteered to fight in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.
He was a West Virginia farm boy, but these fuckers stepped on our soil.
So he laced up his army boots and went to fight.
It was his duty.
Cocaine in Miami?
Kilos from Colombia?
This was my war.
This was my duty.
And I was ready to fight it.
And my wife was ready to fight it with me, too.
One year later... all that patriotic bullshit was right out the window.
OK, man, what do we got?
We got Lizard.
If there's one thing I've learned in the narco world, it's that life is more complicated than you think.
Look at what happened, boss.
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.
And there was a gringo DEA agent taking pictures.
I'll pay half a million for the head of a DEA agent.
Half a million?
Do it.
As you wish, sir.
Fucking gringos.
The way I figure it, everyone gets a miracle.
Maybe you make it to outer space... or marry the Queen of England, or something.
If you consider all the unlikely things that happen in all the world... you gotta think at least one of them will happen to each of us.
Turns out, my miracle was different.
Look.
Quentin.
He's dead.
We should get out of here, Margo.
I thought you closed your eyes when you died.
The truth is... at the time, it didn't feel like that big a deal to me.
It's not like I knew the guy.
It was a much bigger deal to Margo.
I figured it out.
How do you know all this?
Sure.
Margo... we can't go to SeaWorld.
I don't wanna get in trouble.
It's a shame, don't you think?
All those strings inside him broke.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
A lot changed in the years that followed.
But I never stopped thinking about her...
And hoping I'd get a second chance.
It wasn't just me.
Margo was... special.
Her life had become a series of unbelievably epic adventures.
Each one too insane to be true.
Like the time she spent three weeks traveling with the circus.
Or the time she toured with the Mallionaires up and down the East Coast.
Look, if you ask the bassist... he's either gonna say I'm his girlfriend or he wants me to be...
Either way I'm going back there... so you might as well make it easier for yourself and just let me in.
And wherever she went... she always left clues behind for her little sister, Ruthie.
Or anyone else she deemed worthy.
I was never one of those people.
I have so many objections, Mom.
I don't know, it just...
Just didn't work out.
Yeah, she's my mom.
I'd feed her grapes, take her to Paris.
Not a chance, Bloody Ben.
Freshmen know that story?
I'm never gonna get a prom date, am I?
Radar's going to prom.
Radar, has she been to your house yet?
You know very well "what up with that."
My parents own the world's largest collection of black Santas!
And not just at Christmas.
Even so, Radar was the first one of us to get a serious girlfriend.
Gotta go.
Bye, Angela.
So most of my days were exactly like this.
And it almost worked out that way.
Until this one night.
I mean your mom's car.
Why can't you use your car?
Anyway, so like I said, I need to borrow your car.
What, are you committing felonies?
They're part of the problem, actually.
What problem?
There are nine problems.
And your boyfriend's one of them?
Ex-boyfriend.
Do you care to tell me where we're going?
Uh, first, we are going to BJ's.
Basically, this is gonna be the best night of your life.
I really don't wanna get into trouble.
None of which involve jail or dying.
Pull in here.
Like, that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
All will be revealed shortly, my young friend.
What else do we need?
Interesting capitalization.
I'm a big believer in random capitalization.
The rules are so unfair to the letters in the middle.
It's not as weird as it looks.
Still weird.
Why would he do that?
Oh, next left.
And there is Jase's car.
Margo, this is a bad idea.
The Margo Roth Spiegelman revenge plot begins.
Suit yourself.
I can't believe you just did that.
You'll see.
Hello, is this Mr. Arrington?
Do you know what time it is?
What was that voice?
Get in position.
Watch this.
What?
Well, that was fun.
He totally saw me.
He won't.
What makes you so sure?
Let me see.
What?
The Rhode Island of penises.
It may have an illustrious history... but it sure isn't big.
We can't go inside.
I'll be lookout.
You can do whatever you want, Q.
Dad, I'm sorry, okay?
"I'm sorry"?
I have a gun!
Yeah, run!
Couldn't you have just thrown it through a window or something?
We bring the rain, not the scattered showers.
I don't know.
I just thought maybe it wasn't true.
Anyway, moving on.
Lacey's?
Has Lacey been naughty or nice?
Lacey has been distinctly naughty.
We've been best friends since the 5th grade.
And then?
And then, she didn't tell me about Jase.
Ready?
Nice.
Oh, my God, it's so late.
If you're tired, we can go home.
Who lives here?
You didn't think a scumbag like Chuck Parson could emerge unscathed, did you?
Chuck told all the girls not to dance with you and we all went along with it.
All of us.
Here.
"What do I regret more?"
All right, give it to me.
I can feel my heart beating in my chest.
That's how you know you're having fun.
Well, at the end of a grand adventure... one must pause and reflect on one's achievements.
And the best place in Orlando to do that... is the SunTrust building.
We're not breaking and entering.
We're just entering.
Very clever.
His name's Gus.
Do you mind if we go upstairs for a bit?
I'm six months older than her.
Welcome to my office.
Nice music.
Soothing sounds of corporate America.
Come here.
Okay, so, over there is Jefferson Park.
All the lights are off, so that's good.
And over here is Chuck's house.
No lights, no cops.
Seems quiet.
I think we're in the clear.
It's beautiful.
You think so?
From a distance, I mean.
Not you.
Look at it.
I've lived here 11 years... and I've never come across anyone that cares about anything that matters.
Okay, I'll try not to take that personally.
Here's a tip, Quentin.
You're cute when you're confident.
Less when you're not.
May I have this dance?
You owe me one.
Maybe things would have been different... if I'd hung out with you this whole time.
It's not too late.
What happens now?
Will things be different... tomorrow?
I really hope so.
Me, too.
Okay, you see this?
This is your comfort zone.
It's this big, Quentin.
All the things that you want in the world... are way out there.
The way you felt tonight... that is the way you should feel your whole life.
Morning, sleepyhead.
Been trying to wake you for 20 minutes.
Some dream you must have been having.
Getting you a date to prom is so hard that the hypothetical idea itself... is used to cut diamonds.
Nothing.
That was so weird.
Are you sure you wanna do that?
Even if I enlarge it...
Put that away.
No, we did not hook up.
What?
So now what?
I don't know.
I'll let you know when I see her.
But Margo never made it to school that day.
What was she doing?
Who was she with?
Why wasn't it me?
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Spiegelman.
Hello, Quentin.
This is Detective Warren.
Sounds like Margo's run away again.
For the fifth time.
She came to my window and we talked for a second and then she left.
You guys don't think... something happened to her, or anything, right?
We know exactly what's happened.
She's bored.
She wants attention.
She'll come back when she runs out of money... or when people stop talking about her.
So you don't wanna file a missing persons report?
But they weren't wrong about one thing.
If she was gone... she wouldn't be found until she wanted to be.
Three, two, one.
It was a one hit, and a quit.
It's so hard when you wanna sleep with someone that's not in your family.
So, I'm in Saskatchewan.
So you walked in, and Bettina went...
Just say something true.
What do you mean, "Say something true"?
I so don't believe you.
It's true!
Why?
Because we want it to be special.
Stop.
There's something in Margo's window.
Has that thing always been there?
Your parents aren't home, are they?
No, they went to the mall.
Would it be cool if we went up to Margo's room for a sec?
Why?
Just wanted to check on something.
Margo doesn't like people in her room.
Okay, but we're her friends.
No, you're not.
She has every album ever made, except Woody Guthrie.
Up.
Sorry.
Mind if I...
Don't even think about it.
What are you guys even looking for anyway?
We don't really know.
Clues.
We're detectives.
Hey, look.
Holy shit-stickers.
What do we got?
"Walt Whitman's Niece," circled.
What do you think it means?
I think she's sending you a message.
What message?
"Come find me."
Can I talk to you?
The night with the Saran Wrap?
Nah, she was... disappointed.
Yeah, I believe you.
It's just, Chuck knew this whole time, which is awesome.
So, now we're broken up... and I don't have a date to prom the week before prom... and my best friend is off doing God knows what... thinking that I betrayed her, which is something I would never do.
I'm sorry, what did you say about prom?
Something about a date?
See you, guys-
That was the greatest 30 seconds of my life.
Did she ever mention New York or...
No, she didn't mention New York to me... but I didn't talk to her for nine years, so that's...
We had a moment back there.
Must've missed that.
"Unscrew the locks from the doors."
It's a metaphor.
But what if it isn't?
What if it's instructions?
Just put it back.
Yeah, she decided today that she doesn't like the prom shoes she bought... so I'm taking her to the mall while their Midnight Madness sale is still going on.
An address.
It wasn't in Margo's doorjamb, it was in mine.
You can't go to a strange building in the Detroit-iest part of Orlando... in the middle of the night.
Not if we don't show up.
What about Lacey?
What if she's looking for me?
We got no time to waste!
Let's go find Margo!
Was that Italian?
This is it?
Why would she come here?
It's locked.
Now what?
Get a rock?
Guys?
Q, if I were you, I would get that scared every single night.
So, we're in a souvenir store?
No Margo.
For some reason, she wanted you to come here.
This stuff is Old.
Guys?
Did you find something?
Paper towns.
Bro, can we go?
What if it's Margo?
What if it's literally anything else?
Goodbye.
It's a common misconception that... a lot of people...
Don't forget, final papers are due next week.
Also, pick up your pop quizzes from yesterday on your way out.
You're not gonna be too happy.
No circling two answers next time.
Is there any way that I can get a makeup test?
Party at Jase's.
But you can still go to a party at his house?
We should totally go!
Angela is a mature, intelligent, understanding woman... who never has to know about this.
Q, are you seriously gonna spend the rest of high school pining for a girl that ran away?
Margo, where have you been?
You have to get lost before you find yourself.
I was.
You're sweet, Quentin.
You've always been sweet.
I'm glad you're back, Margo.
But I'm not.
Are you gonna answer that?
Besides, Margo's been in this house a million times.
You might even find something.
I think we might be here for a while.
I'm gonna be back.
Well, stop.
Sorry about that.
You okay, Lacey?
I've been better.
You wanna get in the tub with me?
That's the problem.
No one ever looks at me and thinks that I'm smart... or clever... or interesting, you know?
Becca and I got in a fight.
She called me a bitch and a whore.
But, I'm not a slut.
I don't think you're a slut.
Thanks.
Why would Becca be jealous?
She's basically the new Margo.
No one will ever be the new Margo.
You're right.
No one could ever be the new Margo.
Really?
Hey, if anyone gives you any trouble...
Thanks.
How much did he drink?
I think it's stuck to my hand.
I have to tell you something, okay?
Let's get out of here.
Don't kiss me.
You don't get as scared if you sing.
Maybe just sing the first song that pops into your head.
What are you guys doing here?
What are you doing here?
I followed you.
No, she's not here... but I think I know where she might be.
Just love me some Pikachu.
I'm more of a Charizard girl.
What is it?
Margo hung something here... and I think it was a map.
This is Margo's map.
And this is where she used to hang it.
She is... somewhere... in upstate New York.
Can you be any less specific?
This... general area.
There has to be something there.
Roscoe, Rockland, Beaverkill, Agloe, Chatham, Wallaceberg.
These are all the towns in that general vicinity.
Look at this.
Agloe.
Like, 1,200 miles.
Because you love her, right?
Yeah, I do.
Wait, what?
Radar?
I don't know, guys.
And we're doing it now.
Doing it right this damn second!
We gotta make a stop, first.
You know how I told you I was staying in to watch the Cosmos marathon?
Not only that... but I drank a beer.
I didn't drink it, but I held it.
It's a really long story.
Are you breaking up with me?
No, no, no.
I wanted to be honest with you and I don't want you to be mad at me.
Marcus, why do I get the feeling that you're afraid of me?
It was mixed well.
You've never once invited me to hang out with your friends.
That's more about them than you.
You've never even had me over to your house.
It's a story for another time.
I promise, Angela, one day I will answer that, but not today.
I'm not afraid of you.
Angela's gonna come with us.
Not if I can help it.
Do you know how long it takes to put on a prom dress?
We have to be back with 12 hours to spare or prom is ruined.
Prom is very important.
Thank you.
No, we can only stop four times... if we're gonna get there, find Margo, and be back in time for prom.
An exploding bladder.
No, do not get pee in my car.
It's so gross.
Radar, it's so good.
Don't say my name.
Careful!
So gross!
It's nasty.
Perhaps we should make one of those stops now.
If we're gonna keep on schedule, we have six minutes.
I take the credit card to the guy behind the counter... and hold our spot in line.
I pee.
You like dragons?
One minute!
As soon as the tank is full, I'm honking the horn... and all of you guys have 10 seconds to hop back in... or I'm leaving your asses.
Six minutes flat!
I'm gonna need one of those.
Really?
Yeah, it's better that way.
It's way safer.
I still can't believe she hasn't called.
You do realize Captain Ahab's not the hero of that story?
What happened?
And Ben, at the last second, grabbed the steering wheel... spun us to safety, saves our lives.
You were a vehicular ballerina.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Yeah, it's what I'm here for, so...
All right, now what do we do?
We wait.
I think we could probably all use some rest.
Seriously.
How we doing on time?
I'll miss my hair appointment... but a few hours won't hurt us.
I love that movie.
Pretty awesome.
High school.
We hate high school.
He's right, though.
The last time we'll ever be together in the band room.
Last time we'll ever eat pizza and nasty tater tots in the cafeteria.
Last homeroom, last science lab.
These are all terrible, terrible things.
That we're never gonna get to do again.
And, like, this stuff.
Well, I'm going to UCF.
You're going to North Carolina, you're going to Boston.
We've known each other since we were fetuses.
And it's not gonna be like that anymore.
We can't sleep.
Yeah.
What was it you wanted to tell me... back at Jase's house, before you puked yourself?
It was something stupid, probably.
What'd you think?
If you ask me, someone like Margo doesn't really deserve you.
Would you wanna go to prom with me?
Wait, say that again?
You're really gonna make me say it again?
I know it sounds weird.
It's actually 20 times weirder in person.
No, I think it's progressive.
It doesn't make sense that he's always an old white guy.
I think that it's cool that your parents are willing to embrace the complexity of that idea.
Yeah, I think about that every morning... when I eat my Lucky Charms with a little black Santa spoon.
You are.
You got a weird little grin on your face.
What are you guys talking about?
All right, Radar, big man, what's the ETA?
Agloe, here we come.
This is insane.
According to Omnictionary, this should be it.
Let's look around.
How are we doing on time?
It's time to go, Q.
He's right.
Just because you don't give a shit about prom... it doesn't mean that nobody else does.
Why did you even come if you're not gonna see this through?
Because I thought it would be fun... because I wanted to spend time with my two best friends... before we leave for college and probably never see each other again.
I thought I did... but you know what, Quentin?
I came all this way because I was worried about her.
Do you think she'd do the same for me?
Would she do it for you?
Come on.
I'm gonna stay.
I'm gonna find a bus back to Orlando.
Have a great prom, everybody.
Are you serious?
Q, let's go.
I'm trying to get home to Orlando.
I can't believe you're here.
How are you?
I'm just a little surprised.
Wait, what are you surprised about?
I didn't think you would come all this way.
Wait, what did you think?
Quentin, what are you doing here?
I'm in love with you.
Quentin... come OH.
I've loved you since we were kids.
And I've never stopped loving you every single day since.
You don't even know me.
I don't even know me.
Q, I have no idea who I am.
Why do you think I'm here?
I thought...
Why are you here?
Can I buy you a drink?
I couldn't take another second of that place.
It was really that bad?
People have always looked at me and seen what they wanted to see.
"The myth of Margo Roth Spiegelman."
But it's just a fantasy.
So then you came here?
A paper town for a paper girl.
Not a lot to do, but it's a great place to read and think.
Where do I fit in to all this?
You're a way better ninja than I expected.
For all of it.
The clues.
Not being a better friend.
Ruining your last few weeks of high school.
You didn't.
What?
You didn't ruin my last few weeks of high school.
First party.
First road trip.
My first time cutting class.
Everybody else is doing things for the last time... but I was doing them for the first.
Are you sure you don't want to come back?
College, job, husband.
The allure of a life rightly lived.
So, what's the plan?
I have absolutely no idea... but I'm excited to find out.
You know, you... you may not be the myth we made you out to be... but you're still pretty something.
You're pretty something yourself.
You could come with me, you know.
But I have to go.
Do you want to call your sister?
She misses you.
We talk every day.
I'll see you.
What a treacherous thing it is to believe that a person is more than a person.
She was not some fine, precious thing.
She was a girl.
It took me a long time to realize how wrong I was.
And not just about Margo.
I was wrong about a lot of things.
But as it turns out... my miracle... was this.
So maybe we won't all win the lottery.
Or marry royalty.
Or make that last-second shot.
But that doesn't mean we won't have amazing adventures...
Meet exceptional people... and make indelible memories.
Oh, and Margo?
Someone said they saw her in New York, starring in a revival of The Fantasticks.
Someone else said she's on the West Coast teaching surf lessons in Malibu.
I don't listen to those rumors anymore.
But, hey... that's her story to tell.
Sometimes... you know somethings coming.
You don't sleep at night.
The voice in your head's telling you that something... is gonna go terribly wrong.
And there's nothing you can do to stop it.
That's how I felt when my brother came home.
Hey, this weekend's supposed to be fun.
I'm sure it will be.
Good.
Do not make me remind you again.
I got it.
Hey, Mama.
Oh, shit. lt went to voicemail.
This is our favorite hotel in the Keys.
There must be some way we can stay an extra night.
Gwen, could you check Mr. and Mrs. Weller out of bungalow four?
There are my grandkids.
How's my girl?
Everything all right?
Oh, stragglers are still checking out, your father's not back, and Meg won't answer my calls.
So you tell me.
You better hurry, then.
You know how your brother can be.
Next stop, Ta Vernier.
- Hey, Uncle Kevin.
- You're looking cut, my friend.
Don't go poaching my players.
You're stuck with me, you're my anchor.
You're gonna go pick him up?
John, you know I love you, brother.
I have sexy dreams about you.
I know there's gonna be overflow.
Good luck with that.
Did you write something for tonight?
Mama!
Sorry I'm late.
- I was worried about you.
You didn't forget my dress, you stopped to see Marco.
- What are you talking about?
- And your hair is a mess.
Nothing can go wrong.
Well, that's just stupid.
A lot can go wrong.
Sit down.
I'll feel a whole lot better when all my children are together in one place.
Where are you going?
This was a bad idea.
Next stop, Islamorada.
What can I do for you, sir?
That too much?
- Why, can I get one cheaper?
Fuck.
Give me a call when you get this, would you, please?
It'll be here in two hours.
I went to Orlando once, but it was too cold.
And the slaw is soggy.
I'm not paying for that.
All this shit's a week old.
Burnzy?
Holy shit!
On the other hand, these 20 or so pathetic souls have volunteered to be on my brother John's team, who has abandoned you all, so my sister Meg has agreed to take over.
You really heading back up to Miami?
Why don't you stick around for the big Rayburn circle jerk?
Fucking A, that's great.
Now I'm in a bit of a hole.
You need a little cash?
Maybe I find you something?
- I got something going.
You say yes, and I'll tell you.
Hey, it's John Rayburn.
Johnny-Fucking-Be-Good-Rayburn.
Is there a problem, sheriff?
I've been reporting to my parole officer.
Fucking pope is looking for you.
So, what's it gonna be?
Easiest score you'll ever make.
Distinguished guests, I want a fair fight!
- But if you lose...
- Get ready to swim.
Don't bother to show your face at dinner.
Have fun and use your--!
You missed it.
Meg took your team.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's just a silly game.
Come on, in the middle.
It's fine.
Oh, you little rat.
Oh, you little dickens, you.
Where have you been?
I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.
I didn't know why he decided to come back.
I didn't know then what he's running from .
None of us did.
I just knew he was always getting into trouble.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Speaking of which, where are you at with the whole get married, get pregnant, start a family thing?
Is my mother paying you to have this conversation?
Keep it in your pants, you two.
Hey, Mr. Mister, can we squeeze in an extra chair at the main table'?
Exactly like a date.
Thanks.
- What?
- What do you think that's about?
- I appreciate it.
- No big deal.
What's no big deal?
- Your wife's sitting at the table.
- We're married, dude.
The guy that she's engaged to?
- We are not really engaged.
- You've been together for five years.
That's the point, Danny.
What's the problem?
Glad you're here to sort it out.
He wants her to sit at the family table.
Don't act like you don't know what you're doing.
You know exactly what you're fucking doing.
- What am I doing?
- You're so full of shit.
People can hear you.
- Don't do this.
Is that true, really?
- I think you get off on this shit.
- You need to calm down.
You know what we're doing?
We're thinking about Mom and Dad.
The only one here that's all worked up is you.
I'm not gonna do it this time, Dan.
If you're not sitting at the family table, that upsets Mom.
It's the fucking family table.
Why is this so difficult for you to understand?
You think I'm gonna fucking invite a date and not sit with her?
You shouldn't have invited the date.
It wasn't a problem until you fucking made it one.
Forty-five years ago-- It's hard to believe.
Forty-five years ago this weekend, me and my Sally, we opened the doors to this place.
Thanks.
Y'all got such a great family.
Your daddy's funny.
I mean, what did I know about raising babies or running a hotel or anything?
I love you, Mom.
Now, in case you haven't heard, there's a pier being dedicated to us, the Rayburn family here, in a few days off the coast highway.
Just a couple of planks, but I'm glad you're all here to help us celebrate that.
There's something else I wanna say, and I'm not quite sure how to say it.
Many years ago, we had us some trouble.
I recognize some of the people here who helped us through that.
Before I sit down, I'd like to say a few words about my kids.
There's Meg, my sunshine, who went north to Tallahassee to study law up in Yankee country.
And then there's Kevin, my youngest son, whose love of the sea and life, and the 3:00 cocktail... kept him here.
And of course there's John, who likes taking care of people so much that he decided to take care of the whole bunch of us, not just the family, the whole damn island.
But he always finds a reason to come back.
Even if it is to ask for money.
L'm only kidding.
Weekend wouldn't be the same without you.
I wouldn't miss it, Dad.
Well done, Dad.
I'd like to say a couple of words.
- Just a couple of words if I may, Dad.
Here you go.
To the Rayburns.
To the fucking Rayburns!
- You just took the whole bottle, did you?
Boy, you've got a lot of energy.
Looks like your friend's enjoying herself.
About time she went home, huh?
You haven't had a chance to dance with her yet.
I don't dance with other women.
Still kayaking, Dad?
- Every day.
How's your time these days?
I don't miss a stroke.
Glad to hear it.
You look good, Dad.
You go enjoy your family.
The AC in the guest room's on the fritz.
Gonna have to use the fan.
That's no problem.
Something's always broken in this damn house.
- What's that?
- Blood pressure medication.
You got high blood pressure?
I'm managing it.
Hey, I'm sorry about leaving you stranded at the bus stop like that.
Don't worry about it.
I got off at Key Largo, I was gonna go see a buddy.
Come on, buddy.
- Marco, what's going on?
- Just got a call from marine dispatch.
- Oh, shit.
- Everything all right?
Yeah, just got some stuff I gotta deal with at work.
Gotta go out on a call.
Hey, come on, Surf, get away from the water.
You got problems with the gators?
Yeah, one of the neighbors lost a cat last week.
Wow, it's beautiful out here.
Hey, can you hang on a second?
I was thinking of coming back.
- Come back where?
- Why?
- I miss it here.
What are you gonna do here?
I'm gonna help Mom and Dad in the business.
You know, every time you come home you seem to be in a big hurry to leave.
Look, man, if you're in trouble, or you need money...
Fucking A. Why do you always think I'm in trouble?
- Because this doesn't make sense.
- Which part?
Awesome.
Find my fucking dog for me.
I'm not saying I'm a hero for what I did.
A man's supposed to look out for his brother.
That's what family's all about.
In a way, it wasn't just him I was trying to save.
Sorry to ruin the night.
Come to bed.
-ls that something serious?
We go out a few times.
It was fine, good, perfectly normal.
Like "hit her" hit her.
Wanted me to hit her in the face.
Well, good.
I mean, truth is, I didn't really know if I wanted to fuck her or not.
She says again, "Hit me."
And I said no again.
Then she whacks me with her fist.
And I thought she broke my nose.
I realized that she was doing it so, you know, I'd get mad and I'd hit her.
- Fred, how are you?
- I'm good, John.
- How long you been out here?
- Not too long.
Yeah, it's the way it usually works out.
Just around the bend there.
- This is horrible.
What did she say?
I'm sure it's lonely.
Seriously, even just for a week.
Hold it, Tommy.
They asked you to come back?
John's talking to the old man about it.
John will take care of it.
How do you know?
Yum, yum, lunch.
Look at that beautiful bastard.
I can get more.
Well, go, Cousteau.
What do you got, man?
What is that?
You're bleeding, bro.
How come you're not out there playing?
Thanks.
You know, sometimes it's just nice to sit back and watch your kids.
What's on your mind, Johnny?
Danny wants to come home.
He wants to help out with the business.
What makes him think we need help?
Just telling you what he said.
Oh, I see.
Mom!
Help!
And you think I should let him come home?
I think you three should make the decision about Danny.
You discuss it with Meg and Kevin.
Whatever you decide, I'll live with it.
Look, if we say yes, no good will come of this.
You guys know it.
People can change, he can't.
I just don't see how we can say no to him.
No, it's not personal, you know.
We have to think about Mom and Dad here.
Well, the thing is that Dad left the decision with us, guys.
He will fuck things up.
So John's gonna talk to your old man?
Like they can't wait to get rid of you or something.
I'm telling you as your friend, as your buddy, your family... they're the enemy, man.
I think we have to give him a chance.
It's asinine that we're even considering this.
It's just a feeling I have.
You gotta fucking move on.
- Enough, all right?
I'm on your side.
John, as soon as things turn to shit, he's gonna come straight back to you.
There's a lot of shit Danny did for me when we were kids that you don't know anything about.
I want Danny in my life.
I want him to know my children.
Goddamn it, you don't give up on family.
Do you want him to stay?
I was surprised to see you get off that bus.
You should take it easy with those things.
I'm not in any pain.
You gonna stay after the weekend?
Maybe I should go with you.
Fuck it.
Know what I wanna do right now?
What's the matter?
Can't keep up?
Is that Danny out there?
Cover yourself.
We have guests.
Oh, shit...
I can't remember the first time that I caught a fish.
Can you?
You must have been with Dad.
I don't remember.
I can't even remember what happened.
That money I owe you, I'm gonna pay it all back.
Dad gave me his answer.
And what did you say?
Don't do that.
You asked me to talk to him and I talked to him.
Did you try to convince him?
How can I help you?
Did everything in your power to get him to change his fucking narrow mind and take me back?
I did what you asked me to do.
Your life's not always gonna be this perfect.
Things happen to people.
And then you'll need me.
And then you'll know.
What the fuck am I gonna know, Danny?
What the fuck are you even talking about?
Are you saying that I don't help you?
Are you saying that my whole life I haven't tried to help you?
I'll leave tonight.
Don't do that.
The bonfire's tonight.
The pier dedication's in the morning.
You sure you don't wanna stick around for the ceremony?
Are you asking me to stay?
Don't worry about it.
Maybe I'll see you at Christmas, huh?
I always thought the greatest thing that happened to me was being born a Rayburn.
Now I'm not so sure.
I'm gonna tell you everything.
What we did to our brother... we had to do.
Please don't judge us.
My sister is a good person.
But when our brother came home, that was impossible.
There was no way for her to make everyone happy.
And she was forced to choose a side.
That was the worst mistake our sister could've made.
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me.
I'm heading out.
There's a "your place," and there's a "my place."
It kind of feels like your father is my father too.
What's that?
Work.
You wanna talk about it?
You'd rather keep it in, stay up all night and let your blood pressure shoot up.
Found a girl drowned.
Probably not.
Probably much worse.
I don't know anything yet.
Sorry, honey.
- Hey, did you ask him yet?
Fuck, yes.
You know you're flashing every boat in the harbor?
What are we doing?
Well, there's somebody else in my life I'm supposed to be doing that with.
Not that I'm counting.
My dad's in the hospital.
He had a stroke.
They're trying to figure out how bad it is, but it's serious.
I fucked up.
- What do you mean?
- I fucked up with my dad.
It's okay.
I do all my dad's legal stuff.
And he handed over his estate planning to me.
Then what?
I didn't do what he asked.
It's nothing.
I'm making too much of it.
Oh, that's good.
You should come home like you wanted to.
I can't keep up with you people.
But I agree with it.
What about Dad?
I mean, he didn't want me here.
Right?
Look, I don't wanna have to talk you into it.
So I can come home, but I can't see my friend?
You know, you wanna be part of the family business... you gotta have responsibility for the family name.
We all do.
I'll think about it.
That is some quality scratch from just a little boat ride.
You happy with your take?
You asked Danny to stay?
We are, or you'll just decide?
- Well, Dad left the decision up to us, and I'm sorry, but if I recall correctly, you were fine with Danny staying.
Clearly, the doctors don't have any idea how this is gonna end up, and we need to be prepared.
Prepared for what?
What does the will say?
Dad what?
The will says nothing about running this if something happens to Dad.
A couple of things to do.
I was afraid we wouldn't get a chance to play together.
What'd you tell him?
I told him you spent the night.
Anything else?
What else could I tell him?
I don't know what you boys are up to.
That's what makes you so fun.
I'm gonna need this back.
Thanks, Cece.
No one calls me that anymore.
Better not leave town without saying goodbye.
The development board is very protective.
- Where is Mr. Moros?
- He's running a bit late.
Prerogative of the boss.
This is the Keys, and you're developing a major resort.
I'd be doing you a disservice if I said it was gonna be smooth sailing.
My family's in the hospitality business.
My father helped create these regulations.
They're actually designed to discourage development.
- What is it you're trying to do?
It's been hot here going on a thousand years.
Miss Rayburn.
Can I talk to you for a second?
I just wanna say thanks.
He's stable.
It's a standing offer for whenever.
I leave tomorrow, so...
I know.
What are you doing tonight?
It's good, huh?
--Practical things we should probably talk about.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to rely on the staff.
And Danny's gonna help out.
Snorkeling trips.
Where will you live?
I don't know how I feel about Danny doing charters.
I guess he's gotta do something, right?
I can't meet you tonight.
- Oh, I gotta go.
What's up?
Can you take Mom to the hospital tomorrow?
It's not a big deal.
Shit.
Meg was happy when Danny came home.
But what she really wanted was to fix the past, to make up for what was lost.
To make us all forget.
But she couldn't.
Because as smart as she is, no one can change the past.
What happened between you guys?
And I guess things kind of went to shit after that.
I wanted to try again, you know, right away.
But she said that she did not think I was ready to become a father.
Why?
She says I need to grow up.
I see you agree with her.
So I'm just trying to chill out about the whole Danny thing, you know?
Just play it cool.
How do you and Marco keep it together?
You guys are, like, the best couple I know.
Maybe.
I thought you were going to the hospital.
Meg's waiting in the car.
Father and son and two sets of newlyweds.
They'll be divorced by the time I'm through.
Hey, Ma, I need to be put on the payroll.
Of course.
We can talk about that later.
Gwen will let you know when the guests are ready.
Wear your hat.
Yeah, and it turned out that he had several mini strokes.
He seems to have some memory loss, but that could be temporary.
What is it exactly that you're telling us?
I know this is frustrating to hear, but anything's possible.
Spit it right in the visor.
How are you?
How's your father?
We don't know yet.
Patterson's office keeps calling to set up that conference call.
See if you can push it to next week.
- What's with all the flowers?
- They're from clients.
I don't have this many clients.
People at the courthouse sent stuff too.
Everyone's really worried about your dad.
- How is he?
No, I could use the walk.
Go on in and see him, honey.
Hi, Dad.
How are you?
If you're tired, I can come back.
I have to talk to you.
I wish I didn't, but it's important.
I know you told me to redo your estate.
And I didn't wanna do that to Danny.
I hoped that you would change your mind.
So all you have to do is sign it.
It's just right there.
Pen.
What?
It's a pen.
Sarah?
Not in itself, but this is why we need to find the underlying cause.
He doesn't seem to understand anything that's going on.
Well, it's hard to say if it's just speech or if his comprehension is also being impaired.
How bad is he?
He was speaking nonsense.
- Okay, then don't have him sign it.
Fuck.
What would you do?
Do you honestly think that Danny deserves to have a piece of that place?
He's our brother.
And he's home now.
How long do you think that's gonna last, Meg?
I'll be surprised if he's still here in a week.
Oh, Jesus.
How old are you here?
Thirteen, 14.
"Angelfish."
Let me see that.
Oh, we did a lot of fishing on that boat.
Mom's so happy you're home.
Anyway, Mom's really happy.
But that's only gonna make it worse if you leave again.
Who says I'm gonna leave?
The thing is, she just won't have Dad to lean on when you run out.
When did you become John?
I'm just asking you if you are really invested in this.
Am I invested?
Mister, I was here 10 years before you were even a twinkle in Papa Ray's pants.
And we're the ones that have to deal with all the fallout.
That's nice.
But I need to know if she can rely on you.
What's this about?
It's about the future.
I don't often think of you as a lawyer, but right now, you sound a lot like a lawyer.
I'm just asking you a question.
Did Dad disown me?
What?
I know he wanted to.
A while ago.
He didn't do it.
Wow, he must've changed his mind.
Or he never meant it.
You know, he gets angry and he says stuff.
Yeah, I know he gets angry.
Hey, you wanna know if I'm invested in this place?
Treat me like family.
Maybe I'll stick around.
That's a good-looking boy right there.
Meg used to wear glasses?
That's the end of the clip.
It was all in storage.
I'm putting a reel together.
What's this?
That's my first paycheck.
Did you talk to Mom about that?
Then what did she call you for?
You know, Manny makes more than this.
The fuck you talking about, "go talk to Mom"?
What are you thinking?
Just do the work.
Hey, do you need to borrow some money?
Just fucking asking.
Look what you did.
Are you fucking happy now?
Feeling pretty good about yourself, huh?
It's just a little mind control.
Why do you work there?
It's the family business.
Well, they don't deserve you.
No, it's my little sister I gotta watch out for.
Why?
Weren't you in her class?
She was a year below me.
What's that mean?
I don't wanna talk shit about Meg.
Why would anyone not love my sweet little sister?
Because all the boys liked her.
I don't remember this.
She had a fucking army of boyfriends.
She just kept trading them up for a hotter guy.
They've been together a long time.
And he's gorgeous, and they're not married yet.
Why do you think?
Don't know.
You gonna get me that drink?
Yeah, I'll get you a drink, Cece.
Vodka-cranberry, please.
I hate seeing him like this, not knowing if he can understand us.
It's late.
You should let me take you home.
Danny's picking me up.
But you should go.
You should be out with Marco, living your life.
I am living my life.
And I am choosing to be here with my parents.
Hey, Mom.
Let me say good night to your father.
Oh, I should say good night too.
I did, but this must've been dated wrong.
When was this?
Eighty-three, '84.
Just make a decision and stop torturing yourself.
If it would have been any other client, I would've just done what he asked.
And he put you in an impossible situation.
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
I do wanna talk about us.
What you said the other night.
We don't have to talk about it.
- Stop?
- Stop,
There must be a reason.
Is there a reason?
I'd fucking hate for him to have to find out about... that.
That fell out of your bag when you were in the driveway.
Maybe one of the guests dropped it in the driveway.
Did you take that from me?
No, I told you.
- What does it matter?
- You are so off-base right now.
- How you gonna explain that?
Why are you here?
But he still might.
And you may have a say in that.
I've always looked out for you.
Even when we were little kids, I felt sorry for you because Dad hated me, but at least I got his attention.
I don't judge you.
I got your back, Mister.
I just hope you got mine.
Hey, I wanna tell you something.
And you may marry him... because you think that's what Dad wants.
Why's that?
Because you're not her.
Maybe it was Meg's decision that started this whole thing.
I tried to tell her, but she wouldn't listen to me.
Still, I can't blame her for what she did.
Whatever mistakes she made... her heart was in the right place.
And in the end, she's my sister.
What did you do?
And I'd trust her with my life.
My brother Kevin is the hothead of the family.
Always letting his emotions get the better of him.
Truth is, he's a lot like my father.
And I think Kevin's proud of that.
People used to say I was like my father.
I'm not the same man now.
Nothing's the same now.
Are you sure you don't wanna stick around for the ceremony?
Are you asking me to stay?
Don't worry about it.
Dad, Danny left tonight.
John dropped him at the bus.
Listen, just so you know, I voted against having him stay.
He's my son.
Glad you stuck around, bro.
This is gonna be fun.
Any drama at the bus station?
No.
You don't have to look so guilty.
It's okay to be relieved.
Why you still up?
Because the kids are out.
You sure you're a detective?
Hey, how bad a thing are we doing here?
- That the last one?
We got a half an hour before the guard circles back.
All your questions will be answered tomorrow.
I think my mom and dad had a really, really nice weekend.
Well, they deserve it.
There's really only one way, Kev.
But these things happen.
Not in my family.
Bungalow 3's got that leak again.
We're gonna have to replace some floorboards.
We have to fix it again.
- Everything.
I know.
Danny left tonight.
Why?
You know, he does what he does.
Did he say goodbye to you?
I give up.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm done with him.
Maybe it'll be better this way.
Maybe it will.
What happens tomorrow?
You don't wanna fuck this up.
Ten a.m. sharp.
Come on, let's start up.
I know you have a pier dedication to get to, so without further ado, let me introduce you to Juanita Doe.
Third degree burns over half her body.
Also, we've got multiple contusions and abrasions on her chest, her sides and her back.
Any other surface injures, they could've been eaten away by the fishies.
Also, we found fiberglass scrapings embedded in her fingernails.
You're sure she drowned?
Well, her lungs were completely filled.
That means she lived through all those burns.
Well, if it isn't the lesser of two evils.
Haven't you learned to stay away from my brother?
You're looking good, Chels.
Big news about your family.
Is that why you're in town?
Only got instant.
You are looking good.
I thought you left town.
I won't be coming back anymore.
I see.
You know why I asked to come home?
I thought that maybe we could work things out before...
Before what?
Before you die.
He's my father.
One moment please.
Mom, what's going on?
Who brought him in?
Your brother.
Will he be all right for the ceremony?
Mom, no.
He's unconscious.
I don't know what to do.
What should I do?
You don't have to do anything.
What happened out there, Danny?
And then... he just sort of collapsed.
Well, how did he hurt his head?
Yeah, I didn't see that.
He must have hit it on something when he toppled over in the water.
You kidding me?
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm gonna go talk to the doctor, Meg.
Hey, will you wait a minute, please?
I'll be right back.
- Keep your voice down, okay?
I'm gonna cancel the ceremony.
I'll call the staff and get the place ready for tonight.
Thank you.
I'll deal with him.
Shit.
You should drink this.
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna leave.
No one told you, did they?
They're taking Dad for a CT scan.
You should come with me.
Hey... you wanna go talk outside?
What didn't feel right?
Leaving without saying goodbye to Dad.
So you stayed to say goodbye to Dad.
I mean, that's the only reason?
Sure you don't wanna read me my rights?
- We talked for a bit.
He got back in his kayak, paddled away, and then, boom, flipped.
He flipped?
- What'd you do to him?
- I didn't fucking do any--
What are you talking about?
So you go out there and you say goodbye.
Because I didn't wanna leave with any bad blood.
So I told him there was no hard feelings.
And what did Dad say?
Nothing.
- How did you hurt yourself?
- How'd you hurt your shoulder?
By dragging him out of the water while I was trying to save his life.
- How'd you get to the hospital?
Maybe they're the ones you wanna go arrest.
You need to shut the fuck up for once in your life!
Mr. Rayburn?
Dr. Weston is ready with your x-rays.
Eric O'Bannon.
I told you that.
Now can we please get this thing filled.
How did this happen?
I just pulled my goddamned dad out of the ocean.
Please.
I'll call it into the pharmacy.
- The incoming guests.
- Where the fuck are you?
I don't have the boat anymore, okay?
My friend needed it and we are fucked.
- Let's just do it tomorrow.
- Asshole, you are not getting this.
Tomorrow is not a fucking option, okay?
Goddamn it.
Pick me up at the gas station next to Island Village.
I'll try to get my family's boat.
The thing is, Danny was there when it happened.
He brought Dad into the hospital.
I thought Danny went back?
Well, he's saying that he stayed because he wanted to say goodbye to Dad, so...
Do you believe that?
Yeah, O'Bannon's boss said he never showed this morning.
Yeah, he called in sick.
Yeah, could be home in bed or out fucking around.
- What, you want me to pay him a visit?
What, you-- You liking him for something?
Look, Chuck, I'll get in touch with you.
Why do you think he stayed?
I don't know, but we'll find out.
The new guests won't be coming until--
No, I know, but let's do them now.
You keep checking people out.
I'll meet you in the main kitchen after, we can go over the menu for tonight.
- Do you know when he left?
- Just a few minutes ago.
- Are you asking about Danny?
Your brother came to see me earlier.
His shoulder's in a lot of pain.
I think he may have an issue with painkillers.
May wanna consider surgery.
Hey, your lady's here.
All I know is, my Dad was fine last night.
And then Danny showed up.
Kevin, if the doctor said it was a stroke, then it was a--
Kevin, wait.
You need to take a deep breath and cool off.
This is exactly what I've been talking about.
Last thing your family needs is you flying off the handle.
- Find a different way to handle this.
- Thank you for the clothes.
- So, what'd my brother do now?
- I don't know, you tell me.
Look, I'm trying to play it cool, John, but I don't like that you're here.
Well, why would that be?
Since my brother got out, I swear he's trying.
Parole officer even put a couple gold stars on the fridge.
Do you know where my brother Danny is?
He slept here last night.
But he left early, took his stuff, and I haven't seen him since.
Because I know Eric called in to work sick.
So don't know where they are?
Don't bullshit me.
You talk to me this once, nobody has to know anything.
Well, maybe if you find anything out, you can give me a call, huh?
I wish I could call even if I didn't.
That's great.
Prick.
Hey, Jake the Snake.
Family's pretty messed up right now.
Any Update?
They're gonna do another scan to see if the blockage cleared.
- How's everything back home?
- Everything's fine, Mom.
- Have you seen Danny?
He's probably hiding somewhere.
Why are you always so suspicious of your brother?
You always assume the worst.
You really think he had something to do with this?
Why would I think that?
Because you know Danny was mad at him.
Why would Danny be mad at Dad?
And I know your father said no.
You wanted him gone more than I did.
Danny must've fucked with him out there.
I'm going to Hogfish Point.
Hey, who are we putting these out there for?
The guys who are paying us to.
You guys were out here this morning, right?
You took two men to the hospital?
I got my own personal thing, okay?
- What's this?
- I have a few questions about those men.
In the water.
Did they fight?
Did the younger man yell at the older man?
This is my father and my brother, man.
Fuck.
Did he see you?
You wanna talk?
Danny told me he asked to come home.
He did?
Also told me your father didn't want him to.
That's not the whole story.
You don't have all the answers, John.
I want you to ask him to come home.
- Want me to take the cruise out tonight?
Okay, I'll have her back at the inn soon.
- What about?
About whatever the fuck it is you and Eric O'Bannon are doing.
What'd you fucking do to him?
We have guests.
I found fucking witnesses.
Tell me what you fucking did to him!
- I hit him over the head with a paddle--
- You fucking asshole!
Get off me!
I won't be coming back anymore.
You know why I asked to come home?
I thought that maybe we could work things out before...
Before what?
Before you die.
Whatever you're holding onto, you're going to die with it.
I'm tired of the whole thing.
It wasn't me who made the decision, you know.
Kevin and Meg and John, I left it up to them.
It was them didn't want you back.
Could this whole thing have been avoided?
Probably.
We all gave Danny plenty of chances to leave.
It's untraceable.
He just never got the message.
Previously on Penny Dreadful:
- Splendid day, isn't it?
- Sir Malcolm, is everything all right?
- What do you mean?
- He's a changed man since he became reacquainted with you, Mrs. Poole.
Scream for me.
You're in danger.
That big book, with the glyph on the side.
If ever the day comes where my little scorpion is crushed and beaten only then does she open it.
On that day she will have gone away from God forever.
This is my cousin, Miss Lily Frankenstein.
Be still your heart, doctor, Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest.
You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.
Whoever you have made yourself, I'm here to accept you.
We're together for a reason.
Will you let me escort you home?
This place isn't safe for you.
Things become other things.
The leopard consumes the monkey and becomes leopard and monkey.
The crocodile consumes the leopard and becomes crocodile and leopard and monkey.
I have seen this.
The shamans in my mountains call it Uchawi Mabasiliko the changing from one skin into another.
The ones so cursed do not always fully remember it this becoming.
Is it a blessing the purpose of which we cannot yet see?
I say this is what it is for I know you, my friend, Ethan Chandler.
No, Sir Malcolm, that's not it at all.
It wasn't female hysteria.
Don't insult me.
And who was surrounding you?
I don't know.
I find this difficult to credit, I'm sorry.
I think it more likely the room was crowded and she became over-stimulated.
We've been living under a certain amount of pressure here as the mountains of armaments might suggest.
And now?
I need to go.
- I'm coming with you.
I think that's a wise precaution.
Both of you go somewhere far away and stay there.
She's safer here.
I won't be kept a prisoner in this house, Sir Malcolm.
If I'm to be pent up, I'll choose my own cell.
Don't tell us where you're going.
Just go.
This company is safe.
And we're not to even trust one another, then?
Has it come to this?
Then why trust Mr. Chandler to go with you?
Because he wasn't there.
You were all in the room with me, and yet the lions still hunted.
Doctor, may I have a word?
I want to tell you alone where I plan to go.
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
What are you up to, Vanessa?
I've never met a woman less likely to run and hide.
While I'm gone, do be mindful of Sir Malcolm.
He's losing his heart and needs our care.
I shall.
London and all the bright shiny prizes it offers.
She'll grow tired of them.
Then we'll have a long talk on a dark night.
Where should I go?
We'll have to replenish the stores.
And Sembene sent along some tins as well so we won't starve, anyway.
Have you been in such a place?
Indian graveyard in Arizona.
Indians I killed.
Were you frightened?
I felt I belonged there.
I don't know that I'm made for company.
I think I'm made for something like the moors.
And for doing such things as hurt even as they help.
She called me her little scorpion and only said my name aloud once before she was murdered tied to that tree outside.
Thank you, I will go upstairs.
For years now, Sir Malcolm and I have had a very private relationship.
Perhaps I even fed on it.
And Mrs. Poole threatens that?
Doesn't she?
He's lost his anger.
Despite all that you're still the closest thing to a family he's got left.
He didn't go to his own wife's funeral.
Doesn't that demonstrate his allegiance to his family?
Because it was too painful, maybe.
You know better.
He's in love.
The memories of his past, including me are clouds he doesn't want to face.
And why should I demand him to?
Just so I can retain my unique bond with him?
It's selfish.
My God, let him be happy.
Wood betony attracts bees for honey crushed and put into your pillow, it prevents nightmares.
When I was with Miss Croft I was more content than I ever thought I could be.
She was your moors your solitude.
In a way.
But when he settles down, he'll come around.
He won't forget about you.
I certainly didn't.
Are you making a rabbit snare?
Surprised?
Who knew you were so handy?
Life isn't all tarot cards and pagan blood glyphs, you know.
What happened?
Broken wrist and soiled knickers.
That's the most unheroic story I've ever heard.
Mm, you don't fool me.
Dolls.
- Dolls?
Like girlie dolls?
I mean, I played with them.
You had to or they thought you were deviant in some dreadful way but I never liked them.
My mother insisted on deploying them around my room like an army of little play friends.
But every night before I went to sleep I ran around my room and knocked them over.
Then every morning, I would put them all back.
God, those eyes staring at you, just waiting to come to life.
Who thinks that's healthy for a child?
I played with toy soldiers.
Also not the best recipe for mental health when you think about it.
They just wait, don't they?
What?
The monsters inside us.
Monsters?
But one word is much like another.
And when they're released?
We're most who we are.
I need to go out.
There's nowhere to go.
Just bolt the door when I'm gone.
Do you know how to shoot?
- When will you be back?
- Morning.
Tell me.
We're alone.
Speak quietly, but tell me.
Tell you what?
We can whisper about those things that hurt us.
You need to learn to protect yourself.
You haven't done this before?
No, I suppose it just comes naturally.
Why am I not surprised?
It's a different thing when you're firing at something that's alive.
How do you learn that?
Experience.
You think for one minute about what you're doing and you won't do it.
Stop being human.
Become something else.
What?
An animal that has to survive.
And most important...
Don't look into his eyes.
All right.
Moving target.
Just about any of the social graces, for a start.
Well, that's a long list.
My father didn't approve of such things.
It's a deal.
And then?
Let it.
You don't fear it?
Not now.
This must have been how the world was created.
Or how it ends.
Water!
No!
We are dangerous.
What is love but a kind of creature waiting to be unbouns?
The Egyptians were hardly unique in that.
Yes, but to them it was quite literal.
They called it the scorpion's sting a kind of eternal infection that had no end, not in time or death.
The gods Amunet and Amun-ra were immortal and their love was without end as well.
According to the myth, if they were to become conjoined all light would end and the world would live in darkness.
The hidden ones would emerge and rule.
This goes well beyond Miss Ives.
In Biblical terms, it's the coming of the beast.
The hidden ones who will emerge?
Vampire?
His name is legion, for he is many.
He believes this to be Miss Ives, and she loves him in her way.
They are aligned, these two.
He tries to lure her, seduce her attack her, if he must, but he must have her.
Why?
Why does the scorpion sting?
The scorpion will still strike, whether you believe in him or not.
We have to help her.
I'm onto something new here something I didn't expect.
Think how your mind works, doctor.
Yes, the demon, the hound, the scorpion endlessly circling one another.
You know Mr. Lyle won't give up.
If there's any sense to be found in all this, he'll find it.
Put an end to it.
And then?
I can't live forever violated.
When I sleep, when I wake, when I pray, those demons tearing into me.
I begged you to put a bullet through my heart but you thought it kindness to spare me.
It was cruelty.
If I have one goddamn purpose in my cursed life, it's that.
You are one man.
We are not like others.
We have claws for a reason.
Do you ever think what it would be like to be like other people?
Normal people?
I try not to.
My God, so she's come back.
Got herself a man now, does she?
One word from me and you don't have an arm anymore.
They know how to behave.
You know how you get a dumb animal to behave?
You give them food or you don't.
Learned how to behave yet, little bitch?
- That's enough.
- Not hardly, lad.
Young flesh burns best.
I swore one day I would see him again and be avenged.
You don't need his soul on your conscience.
I hope you can live with it, because I sure as hell can't.
Of course I do.
LILY: Do you not like Mr. Gray?
It's not that.
For heaven's sake, Victor, I can't stay cooped up here all the time.
You should go.
I'm sure you'll have an amiable time.
And Mr. Gray will certainly be a charming dinner companion.
Tell me not to go and I won't.
Don't be silly.
I could use some time to work.
You're an awful distraction.
You won't be late?
I was surprised to get your invitation.
Your choice or his?
My cousin is protective.
I don't think you need much protection.
You are, I believe, more capable than you perhaps appear.
Is it?
I've never been anywhere.
Then will you allow me to escort you?
- Oh, it's awful.
- It's not real, you know.
Well, I know that, but I can't.
So familiar, but not.
Caught here in the midnight act of exhuming a body.
Why would they do that?
To sell it to a doctor for medical experimentation.
What sort of experimentation?
I couldn't say.
London is nothing if not filled with new adventures.
Yes, I'd like that.
It's good to have a new friend.
And so I hope you'll always count me.
No one's ever done that before.
New adventures.
Number 17, Shad Thames.
Could you stop, please?
Well, hello.
You were going to kill him.
I didn't get the chance.
But I guess you know that.
Do you feel better now?
Now that you're a murderess?
I suppose that's what you learned here, isn't it?
From your nice old lady friend.
Do you?
Do you know what it is to walk with someone's body tied around your neck for the rest of your goddamn life?
Do you know what that is, little girl?
Third time, you don't blink.
Then it's all just repetition.
You don't cry anymore.
You don't even remember when you used to cry.
- Stop it!
You'll never get your soul back.
Not ever.
Do you understand that?
Welcome to the night, Vanessa.
There's something you need to know.
We know about Eddie.
The blocks in the playroom spelled out a name, 'Charles'.
A's recreating a prom we already had?
What if we used this staircase to make a grand entrance for Ali?
Then where is this place?
You should be standing up here, Charles.
'Oh, my God.'
We're still trapped.
Stop!
There's no way out.
I'm not going back down there.
You maybe a dude but you're still a bitch.
You mean like the way he moved?
Wait, so your saying you know Charles a little, but you feel like you know him a lot.
I can't explain it, it was just a feeling.
It's going to get cold out here tonight.
Where do you think we are?
No, we're in the Northern Hemisphere, that's the waning moon.
This fence is like a giant lightning rod.
You going to let us fry out here?
How long can a person live without food?
Three weeks.
Mine are definitely working.
I'm so thirsty, I'm seriously considering drinking my own pee.
I can totally suck on a pee ice cube right now.
I'd lick sweat off a jockstrap.
Okay, Emily, you win.
I don't know how much longer I can handle this.
You can handle it, Aria.
I mean, I-I'm afraid to stay up here but I'm also scared to death to go back there.
What do we do?
What the hell?
Hanna.
Is this a hospital?
Looks more like a morgue.
- Thank God.
Emily, we'd be dead.
You only need one kidney.
♪Hey, guys, I think A wanted to make us look dead to send a message to our families.
Mona, what the hell is going on?
What happened to us?
I'm scared too.
Only a few hours.
'Please return to your rooms and find your surprises.'
No.
'Please return to your rooms and find your surprises.'
'I said, "No."
Ali.
It steals you in the night and puts you in the hole.
Whatever the hole is I don't wanna go there.
'Today, their friend, Alison DiLaurentis' 'whose murder conviction was recently overturned' is about to address the public for the first time.
Police are reminding viewers to report any information on Andrew Campbell's whereabouts.
The star athlete and honor roll student remains the top suspect in the kidnapping case and is presumed to be dangerous.
Excuse me, Alison, Alison, one question.
My friends have always been my rock.
Without them I'm lost in the woods.
Totally alone.
This better work.
Andrew's been obsessed with the girls since Ali went missing.
If he really thinks that she's here alone there is no way he'll pass up the opportunity to grab her.
And if you're wrong?
Your daughter will have police protection 24 hours a day.
- So what do we do now?
Toby, what the hell?
Everybody stay absolutely silent.
I know I'm the one that you really want.
Just tell me where you are and I'll find a way to get there.
But I have to know that you won't hurt them.
Did you get it?
The caller's in the house.
Do not open this door for anyone.
You stay down here.
Why aren't you downstairs?
Where the hell is she?
- What is it, Toby?
It's called "Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree."
Ali figured it out before we did.
And I think that she went there to meet Andrew without us.
Oh, it's Toby.
'Ali, those are for you.'
It transports a signal to a satellite and bounces back to us.
So wherever Andrew takes you we'll only be a few seconds behind.
And if this works then you'll take us right to the girls.
Well, you know what they say give the girl a good pair of shoes and she can conquer the world, right?
'Please proceed to Ali's room and prepare for arrival.'
I'd ask if you were okay but..
Let's not talk about what we just went through.
At least not until we get out of here.
I don't know if I could even find the words.
I don't wanna get in trouble again.
Let's just go.
Be careful.
This is all Ali's stuff from her room at home.
How did A get all this stuff?
You're seriously still asking how?
Did A force you guys to sign the welcome card for Ali?
The real Ali, not Mona.
So Ali's a sitting duck.
We are not the same people we were back then.
Including Ali.
Hey, Spence, can you come help me with this?
She's busy.
What?
You see what I mean?
If you have any idea where she could be right now you better tell me before it's too late.
'Behind the reporter.'
Can you get a plate number?
That's the best we're gonna get.
I'll call it in.
This better not be a colossal mistake.
You got a box too.
A is making this house our home.
You guys, Charles took our stuff before he took us.
I thought that I lost this ages ago.
They're barely hanging on to hope.
Can you just imagine what they're going though?
Not knowing that if we're okay has made my mom physically sick.
They took her to the hospital.
Of course, you did.
I can draw some really, really pretty pictures.
The generator still shuts down with the switch-over.
I heard it too but I was too scared to leave my room.
See?
'You have reached your destination.'
'I said, open the trunk of the car, Alison.'
She's still not moving?
No, she's at a dead stop.
That's a poor choice of words.
This doesn't feel right.
'You should call Toby.'
Ali's signal stopped here.
'Put on the clothes and start walking.'
'Leave everything else behind or they die.'
Which way did she go?
Hey, she put 'em like this for a reason.
Let's go.
Hanna, let's go.
I feel like they grew up together.
If I'm right, everything that matters most to Charles is in this vault.
If we get in, we can use what's inside to bargain our way out.
But Mona said we won't make it to the vault before the power comes on.
Okay, if I'm right, this is as far as we need to go.
The vault is on the other side of this wall.
Charles disappeared like Houdini when Mona came into the room.
So there's gotta be like a secret passage way 'or like a trapdoor or something.'
A does have a soul.
'Wanna say goodnight to your sister..' '...and give a little kiss?
Game on, Charles.
We want Mona back!
Let's torch this place.
Guys, let's get outta here.
Do you hear that?
Oh, hang on, hang on.
'Call 911.'
I thought I lost you.
Don't ever let me go.
Never.
'Hey, there's another girl down here.'
What's your name?
I met Sarah's friends, remember?
She lived in Courtland.
She went missing' around the same time Ali did.
Ali, who is Charles DiLaurentis?
- How you doing today?
You think there's any way you can tell me where this boat was built?
Well, it's definitely been repurposed.
Cobbled together from God knows where.
Doubt it's local.
You're right, my love.
That's nice to know.
About what?
Exactly what you're thinking.
Just hanging on.
Feel like playing that thing?
No.
Guess not.
Feel like going home.
Our guys said they can't get us any point of origin information on this boat.
The serial numbers were burned in the fire.
So there was someone else.
They killed her?
Possibly, and/or immigration.
See, that's where my money's at.
Except she's not gonna cross the Gulf Stream on her own.
Maybe they made it to dry land.
- Well, this looks like my signature.
You really expect me to read all this?
If you have anything you want me to explain or any questions, let me know.
I already signed it.
I know, Dad, but you were in the ICU.
I thought maybe you might have changed your mind, so I didn't file it.
Nothing's changed.
And he's doing a really good job.
Look, sunshine, what do you expect me to do with this, huh?
I was hoping you and Danny could work things out.
I'll think about it.
You know, Danny's the one who saved you.
That's what you told me.
I asked him to stay.
I know you wanted him to leave, and I hope it doesn't upset you.
Whatever makes you happy.
I missed you.
Good morning.
- They cut him loose?
- With flying colours.
And he's okay with you being here.
We're gonna all be fine together.
The beach looks perfect since you've been doing it.
We start fresh every day.
Fresh start.
- I told you I liked compliance.
You got something against a motel?
Okay, Reynolds, 27 boat slip, Hey There.
Gone for the season, but they said we could take her out.
Dr. Sachs, he wanted us to put in a new jack plate by the end of next week when he gets back.
Who do you think she's talking to?
Well, they don't look like tourists.
That fucking car.
I'm sorry, but it's just not gonna happen.
But how can you be so sure?
Well, we cater to a clientele that expects that access.
You said there's nothing within the regulations that forbids it.
Right, but you hired me for my advice.
Even if the committee says yes, the community won't allow it.
But it's not impossible?
It'll be a waste of your time and your resources.
If it's a deal breaker, you might consider pulling out of the project.
Well, is it a deal breaker?
Here we go, Ben-o!
Thank you so much.
- Jaguar what?
- Never mind, Dad.
I wished that I looked half as good as he did when I was his age.
I thought I asked it quiet enough.
Number two?
I wish I could stay longer.
Let the wheels stop turning.
Well, I do really only have an hour.
I really did miss being with you guys.
I'm not good at doing hospitals.
Don't worry about it.
There's probably tequila if you want it, Mom.
To Dad coming home.
Look at Dad.
Hey, Pop.
You want me to take you home?
What's the score?
No, we should have it at the inn.
Oh, I would love to see Janie and her friends all dressed up.
Oh, it was so fun!
My husband should never be near a microphone.
Never let him sing in front of the children.
Janie's talking about wanting to keep it real small.
- Is she old enough for that?
Then that's fine.
I wanna be with my friends and parents on a boat in the middle of the ocean.
What do you thinks gonna happen?
I remember that.
Well, we all lie.
How's it going?
This fucking thing, man.
You know, I just-- I can't get this thing to turn over.
Didn't I tell you not to star': messing with this truck?
Who told you not to mess with this truck'?
Hey, you got any ideas?
So how's everything going?
Well, I got a call from Mr. Moros late last night.
He's decided not to move forward with the project here.
Yeah, he's gonna start looking at other locations.
Well, that's probably the best decision.
I hope your firm was happy with the service.
Actually, that's something I wanted to discuss with you.
Alec mentioned it, but I would have said the same thing.
I did my third year summer in Dallas.
Vermont.
A place almost as beautiful as this.
You should give it some thought.
I appreciate that.
Gas with the same chemical marker found on the boat and the girl was stolen from here two weeks ago.
Well, that's useful, isn't it?
The only other place where you can get gas with this same exact chemical marker is south of Marathon.
So they steal the fuel, they fill the boats, they take them back wherever they came from.
And it explodes.
Just wondering.
Because of that.
And later on this afternoon, near sunset, we're gonna take you out on a cocktail cruise.
That is Mama Ray's handiwork right there.
- Can we pick them?
- We can enjoy looking without touching.
Look, I'll see what I can do, okay?
- Bumpy.
- I'm not the greatest of flyers.
The big questions here are salt or no salt.
Kevin.
I thought we lost you to those Berkeley fuckers for good.
- You miss the fishing?
- I came to help my mom.
She officially put the property back on the market.
Looking for some property to build a vacation home together?
- What do they want to develop?
I'm sure they'll clean this place up though.
Even Florida deserves a bit of class.
Listen, Nick, I wanna make an offer.
We seem to be pretty far downfield with these guys.
Besides, how can you afford it?
- You're barely staying afloat as it is.
Yeah, it's a good thing you made me get this footage.
There.
I'm trying to back it up.
Just hold it there, would you?
You look good.
And I was wondering when you're gonna have a boy.
I'm working on it.
I'm great.
Well, you're young yet.
So I'm gonna have to take a closer look.
You really believe that's an accident?
Well, the evidence isn't saying otherwise, so, yeah, I do.
Immigration run gone bad.
I got another job for you.
Any night you want works.
You just call--
Ladies, I cannot be the only one who's wearing these.
You know, I'm the best swimmer in the whole of the Keys.
Now I'm gonna teach you guys.
And one day, I'm sure, you guys are gonna teach someone else.
Congratulations.
So if you impressed her, that's on you.
So you interested in the offer?
Made any decisions?
It's no rush.
You remember that song...?
How--? "I've been in the bend"?
Oh, I can wait.
Whatever suits you.
Maybe I'll just catch up with the newspaper.
We have to file the will.
I don't wanna talk about it, Robert.
So there's no need to talk about a will.
- What are you drinking?
- I thought we'd sit out back.
Okay, I'll tell them to let Kevin and John know.
Actually, they're not coming.
So how you feeling?
You wanna sit with us?
You supposed to be drinking?
No, I'm supposed to be dead.
Kind of hard to care about things like drinking.
You know what I like about you and me, Danny, is that we can lay all our cards on the table.
You know, there's no bullshit.
What's going on, Pop'?
I want you to leave and not come back.
It's never worked out with you being here, has it?
I don't remember anything.
I saved your life.
L'm your son.
I'm too old to start brand-new.
I'm too old for that.
And more.
Why don't you show me what it's worth to you.
I mean, really show me what it's worth to you to protect your family.
Rayburns.
I am showing you!
That's not enough.
Tomorrow morning... you tell me your price, and I'll wire it to you wherever you are.
Deal.
You will never see my face again, Dad.
Robert Rayburn is dead.
How long?
Two days, I imagine.
No, not with them.
Maybe you should tell them you're coming.
Well, maybe better if I don't.
Another perfect night in paradise.
Yes, it is.
Your son took us out on the reef this afternoon.
I've never seen anything like it.
Isn't it beautiful out there?
So much life going on under the waves.
It's all around us all the time, but we so rarely get to see it.
We're happy to have you celebrating your honeymoon.
I need to cancel it. ls there some kind of bullshit penalty I have to pay?
What is she doing?
She's just sitting out there.
The last time I saw him, I just talked about business.
We were driving in his truck.
Wait, where'd you guys go once you dropped us off?
Just went for a drink, had a talk.
About what?
Oh, he... wanted me to take on more responsibilities at the inn.
Hey, the moon's out tonight.
Mom, sit down.
Thanks, Meggie.
Mom, a lot of people have been calling.
You know, they're asking about a memorial service.
We don't have to talk about it now, but if you have any ideas...
He told me he didn't want a service.
He said he didn't want to be buried in the ground, and he didn't want people fussing over him.
I'm glad you two had some time together.
Everyone thinks they have something to say, and it just goes on and on.
I want you to speak for all of us.
Make sure you give yourself plenty of time, though, okay?
Because it always takes longer than you think.
- Yeah, thank you.
Well, you know, he had a massive stroke, and then he got a clean bill of health, and then, boom, he just dropped dead.
Well, if there's anything we can do...
All you guys gotta do, enjoy yourselves.
Because that's what Dad would have wanted.
I thought I'd set up a table and put some of these out for the reception.
I love that idea.
I just don't know which ones to choose.
This one.
Sorry-
I wanna put this one out.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I think she should be there for him in some way.
I didn't even know you had all of these.
They had a special bond.
Yeah, I remember.
So, what does this mean for you?
Dad's dead?
I mean for your plans.
So you gonna stick around?
I am, yeah.
Cool.
Hey, excuse me.
You want some of mine?
What time's the service tomorrow?
How's it coming along?
I don't know what the fuck I'm writing.
Thanks.
Oh, jeez.
What's this, your eulogy?
- What the fuck's that supposed to mean?
- The man had a lot of stories.
- What?
- Nothing.
Yeah, I mean at the service.
I mean, just, it seems kind of strange... that I wouldn't say anything.
I don't think it's strange.
So you don't think I should say anything?
I don't think you should say anything if you don't wanna say anything, no.
Hey, you remember Lenny Potts?
Dad's friend?
I think I just saw him in town.
Really?
Jesus Christ, I hadn't thought about him in... a long time.
Mom?
And how old are you, John?
Fourteen.
Thought I heard you down here.
Oh, you found your father's secret stash.
You know it was never really much of a secret.
Pour me a glass.
Danny wants to say something at the service tomorrow.
We've already discussed this.
I'm sorry.
I just don't think your father would want Danny to speak.
Well, Dad's not here, and Danny is.
I don't even know what the hell I'm gonna say.
Well, it doesn't have to be perfect.
Well, it would be nice to be able to say something about him that people don't already know.
Well, what you don't know, he didn't want you to know.
He didn't like people feeling sorry for him.
How bad was it?
- It was supposed to be a cattle ranch, but his grandfather was a shit businessman.
He was a shit everything.
- Do you know why?
- Because he was a shitty student.
Yeah, he was too busy getting into trouble back then.
But that's not why he didn't graduate.
Why didn't he graduate?
You remember Gram?
Bits and pieces, yeah.
He liked her better than he liked his father, which wasn't necessarily saying much.
Anyway, your father was off somewhere, and when he came back, he couldn't find his stepmother.
What do you mean, he couldn't find her?
So he couldn't find her.
Black and charred.
But he just kept sticking them with that grilling fork and flipping them over and over again.
He must've been drunk.
Anyway, that's when Robert knew that something wasn't right, and he went back in the house, and he asked your Uncle Tuck and Aunt Lynn if they knew where she was.
And they were just little kids then, and they were too scared to say anything.
Well, he didn't know why.
But then I guess he heard some kind of... moaning and crying... and he realized it was coming from the cellar.
Your father let her out and saw that her face was all...
Well, what?
Blood, broken nose.
No, it was rural Texas, late '50s.
And they wouldn't have done anything.
So he went back outside to confront your grandfather, and they fought.
They went at it.
And what happened?
Your grandfather cut him with a steak knife.
And your father... he snapped.
And he grabbed the grilling fork, and he stuck it in your grandfather's throat.
He said he almost killed him right there... but somehow he stopped himself.
He told me... he had two little holes in his throat, like he'd been bit by a rattlesnake.
He used to laugh about that.
Found it funny somehow.
He told me once that... if he didn't get out of there, he would have killed the son of a bitch.
That's why he never finished high school.
- Where's Belle?
- She's not coming.
- Are you serious?
- I didn't want her here.
It was my decision.
Is that all you can say?
He just lost his dad.
- What are you gonna tell people?
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Thanks.
My father didn't talk much about himself.
He told a lot of stories.
But he didn't talk much about himself.
Christ, this is a lot of pages.
What the hell.
This.
Because when he was 17 years old and he left home... because all he had...was nothing.
Walk onto that porch and look over my...kingdom.
But I will never know that feeling or that pride... because I didn't build it.
He could be tough.
He could be hard.
He had a vision for the family, and he knew exactly what he wanted us to be.
If you didn't-- lf you didn't toe that line, or you didn't live up to that vision, you...
He made me who I am.
And now my brother Danny, he'd like to say a few--
Well, I know how he feels.
I know how we all feel.
And we'd like to thank all of you, everyone... for coming out and paying your respects... to our father.
You were the one who left me.
We should be out there with your--
What am I doing?
Get out.
Get the fuck out of my family's house.
- How's your mother?
- She's not so great.
It's a disease.
You okay?
I know that wasn't easy for you.
I was just a little distracted is all.
Detective Potts.
You could not see him through a fog of skirts.
- Thank you.
I'm sure Detective Potts has more to do than worry about what I'm up to.
Well, I don't know why you'd wanna pick through this old brain, but buy me a drink, I'm happy to listen.
Hey, are you okay?
- You're okay?
- Yes, thank you, Marco.
Take care of my girl.
Hey, come over here.
Hey, Meg, is everything okay?
I've been trying to reach you.
I told you I cannot talk to you right now.
I just wanna make sure you're okay.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I'm at my father's funeral.
I don't know if you remember me.
I had forgotten how clear this water is.
Yeah, it's something.
Whole place, one big coral reef.
That's right.
Well, hey, I'll let you have your peace.
You think they have something going on?
Now there's a perfect couple.
What happened with you and Belle?
Did you guys fight?
I've never seen her like that.
A few days later, we found a charred hull.
Diesel fuel on the boat matches up to the fuel on the girl.
Teenage girl wouldn't be alone on a pleasure cruise.
- Find any other bodies?
- One, but there have to be others.
A few weeks later, found a body 50 miles north.
Had a study commissioned on the current patterns.
Report should be in the archives somewhere.
Be sure to check into that.
You never know.
You miss working?
I do a little Pl stuff part-time.
Keeps me busy.
You know, my dad talked about you a lot.
He made you out to be like John Wayne or something.
I don't know if you remember, but you took Danny and I to the gun range one time.
We thought you were-- We thought you were a badass.
That's what we called you, Mr. Badass.
I got no fucking idea what he's talking about.
The only thing that you need to worry about is that I'm free.
And I'm free to be a drunken fucking idiot.
Hey. you got any blow?
And he's a drunken fucking idiot.
- You don't fucking believe that.
It would've killed him.
Frog Baylor's house party...
You remember that douche bag?
Hey, dude, are they fucking together?
You want some blow, really?
Fuck you.
What happened with you and my father?
We had a disagreement.
It happened about the time that you lost your sister.
I don't know how much you remember about all that.
I try not to think about it too much.
And for Bobby.
You lose a child, it does something to a man.
It was tough.
We worked our way through it.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
And then your brother was injured.
How's Danny been doing all these years?
What's he doing?
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's nice to see you're doing well.
Thanks for the beer.
I should be going.
Please, be home.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You can stay, you know.
Yeah, that's not what this thing is.
- What thing?
- You and me.
Morning.
What is it?
Well, for not doing my job better, I guess.
I know what happened to you, Danny.
I know how you got hurt.
I knew it at the time, but I couldn't prove it.
I wanted to tell you how sorry I was about your father... and that's all.
Your father was my good friend, but he had a mean streak.
What happened to your sister was an accident, but your father, he took it out on you.
I did what I could at the time, tried to talk to your family about it.
But I should have done more.
What do you mean you tried talking to my family?
They never told you?
Well, there's something you need to hear.
Date is November 11th, 1983.
This is Detective Leonard Potts interviewing John Rayburn.
Can you say your name for the record?
John Rayburn.
And were you there when your brother got hurt?
And what happened?
He was hit by a car.
- And was your father there?
- No, sir.
He was at the hospital with my sister.
Are you sure you're telling me the truth?
Lottie.
I hate to think of you in that place alone.
I wish they'd let me visit.
Not without you.
The days are so long.
I don't know when the trial is.
I assisted in a Previa surgery the other day, with Bertie and Dr. Edwards.
They lifted Dr. Gallinger's suspension but he still hasn't returned to work.
That's all I have for now.
Please write if you can.
I miss you terribly and want so much to know how you are.
I wish I could see you my love.
Yours, Lucy.
If you want I could... tattoo her lips to make them appear more plump.
I'll only you charge you 4 bottles.
No, thank you.
Two?
Any more cases?
Plague is carried by rodents and fleas.
You think your wooden barriers are keeping them inside?
Dr. Feng just said there are no new cases.
There's no need for the quarantine.
Mayor Phelan says them coolies got it and I trust the mayor.
Mother Superior.
My child.
Did you come all the way from Ohio to see me?
I wanted to.
I brought something.
It's what you gave me your third year at the convent on the date of our Virgin Mother's birth.
The day that you committed yourself to God.
And I always carry it with me when I travel.
I was so proud of you, how far you'd come since that little Irish girl abandoned by her mother on the train west.
You saved my life.
You brightened ours.
Lost and then found.
Is it true?
I could say that God sent an angel down to instruct me or there was something divine about it... but there wasn't.
The women just needed help and I helped them.
So it's true.
I am what they say I am.
You have disgraced me, the sisters who loved you, the convent that saved you, the nurses who taught you, the Catholics who nurtured you, and the God who loved you.
This is all that's left of you in my heart.
There are some straw-colored striae that are visible.
How is the peripheral vision?
Some issues.
Put this over your right eye.
And how do these appear to you?
Have you had any blows to that eye recently?
Not much to recommend.
Rest in a recumbent position for several weeks may bring some relief.
So it could heal on its own?
And any further blows could prove catastrophic.
Are there any other procedures?
Experimental?
They're all unproven and much too risky.
What about this one, Everett?
Looks to be about the right shape and color.
Dorothy?
You have a wonderful eye, love.
You're certainly lucky to have a sister with such a wonderful set of teeth herself.
How long are you visiting from Philadelphia?
I often get a new batch of teeth from the morgue on Thursdays if you'd like me to return then.
No, I want to finish now.
She'll do 14 miles an hour and never need a drink of water or a bucket of oats.
Just plug her in and she'll do the miles.
And you want me to pay you to drive this?
You put Knickerbocker up there on the side, people will be making themselves sick to take a ride in her.
And what if it runs out of electricity?
I doubt that.
I'll give you $45 a month to cover the automobile, 10 of which comes back to me and you pay for all repairs to keep it running.
Mr. Barrow, you just got yourself the finest ambulance in all of New York City.
Nurse Baker, light, please.
Retract more, nurse.
What do you notice?
It occurs in about 15% of cases.
We'll need to separate out and ligate both arteries.
The inferior one is exceptionally underdeveloped.
It's hard against the hepatic.
Dr. Gallinger.
Tell me, how... how are things at home?
I am ready to resume my duties.
I see.
Well, I must admit that having a third set of experienced hands would be useful in picking up the slack, but know this... you come back, you come back as subordinate to me with the full respect and deference that implies.
I think I'll come back when the chief of surgery returns.
You think this hospital will go along with that?
You're as dumb as you think I think you are.
Come in.
Nurse Elkins.
I miss you calling me Lucy.
It's your title in this institution.
I think a woman such as yourself would be glad to receive any sign of respect at this point.
You don't have to be mean.
It's not in your nature.
What do you want?
It's just that it's your birthday tomorrow.
Aren't you gonna open it?
It's a caduceus.
It's real gold.
Must have cost you a lot.
I wanted to.
I can't accept this.
You've all approved the architectural plans and I've set about hiring the best contractors in New York.
Not a penny of your money will be wasted on manpower or materials.
Dr. Edwards is waiting to give us a report on his efforts.
Bring him in.
Dr. Edwards.
Despite being understaffed, the surgical service has been able to average over 40 surgeries per week with no increase in complications and an 18% decrease in mortality.
When will Dr. Thackery return?
The news I've received indicates the man is in no shape to return and likely never will be.
He seems lost to his addiction forever.
I'm sure you would.
At the very least, I think it would be prudent to start a search.
For a fourth surgeon, yes.
No, for a man to take your job atop the department.
There are the right sort of men at several institutions around the country who would make excellent candidates.
I know a very good junior man at Dartmouth who would be eager to make a step up.
Before we go casting about New Hampshire for new blood, let's put together a set of criteria, most of which I'm sure Dr. Edwards already fulfills, and begin a more formal process.
I was recently able to lure Dr. William Mays out of private practice and to our hospital.
In addition to being an excellent doctor, he was also trained as a surgeon.
You hired a surgeon without consulting me?
He is connected to the wealthiest people in New York.
I know you're hot about the meeting, Algie, and I don't blame you.
Waiting in the hall like a child outside of the principal's office.
You're not Thackery, for better or for worse.
You see Habershorn's face when you said you wanted to be made permanent chief?
If I hadn't known better, I would have prescribed him something for impacted constipation.
But, you of all people know that we have to move carefully.
The other board members have neither the progressive mind nor the courage to... make the sort of change that you and I want.
The world may not be moving fast enough for us but its likely moving much to quickly for them.
These are not the kind of men who like to make history.
They'd rather tout there ancestors place in it.
You might remind them of your ancestors place in it.
Then I trust you to do that.
Phillip, you're home so early.
I didn't expect you until six.
Well, I told you this morning I'd be back for lunch.
Where are you going?
I'm helping a sick friend, that's all.
I'll be back before the curtain.
Any of these patients you had could afford private rooms?
Hardly.
Something doesn't scrime.
Will this be sufficient?
If your asking then that means you got more to give.
There's a dozen more wagons coming.
Yes, you do.
Are you family?
No, a colleague.
I don't know under what name he might be registered, but he is here and I will see him.
Our patients require privacy.
Mr. Crutchfield.
Is it time for my med...
Everett.
I am due my dose in 15 minutes, not 20.
They love to experiment here like we're mice.
But I don't need to tell you that after what you went through with Eleanor.
What time is it now?
You're no better than when you came here.
John, you are desperately needed back at the Knick.
I'm not going back.
You're staying?
While you're here, you could do me a great favor.
I'll figure something out.
Cornelia?
What happened?
Where'd you get the money for something like that?
Sold some things.
What things?
Some jewelry, that's all.
I know they were important, but when I thought of all the good they could do...
Mr. Showalter.
What... what are you doing here?
He took the train from New York to surprise us.
I thought I'd stop off.
I'm sorry you had to see us squabble.
It's my fault.
It's the fire that Phillip loves in you.
They were yours to do with as you wished.
Having purpose is important, but you already have one.
Perhaps a bit.
It's so different out here.
How can a New York girl be expected to get her bearings in a place like this?
I don't think I've been unduly influenced.
What if I arranged it so that you could return to your family?
Leave San Francisco?
But Phillip loves it so.
I'm sure he loves you more.
What matters is your marriage, being close to family and the people who love you.
I've just built some apartments at the bottom of Central Park.
I'd like you both to have one.
With 11 bedrooms, you can bear as many children as you want.
I'll have to talk it over with Phillip.
He's already decided.
We were discussing it when you arrived.
Thank you for letting me know, Dr. Hackett.
Nurse Elkins...
He hasn't.
Help!
Hello, Thomas.
Have they set a court date yet?
Week after next.
Any word in the papers?
You never should have taken that job without me.
Harry, we were a team.
You'd have brung me and we wouldn't be in this pickle.
I'd have known if the coppers were waiting for you.
You were off getting pissed down the Donegal Pub.
All right, fair play.
You thinking of turning yourself in?
Christ, no.
I'm just slagging you.
Since when did you forget how to show your teeth?
Since you got penned up in this place.
What are you going to do?
Best money can buy.
With what money, Mr. Carnegie?
Don't be doing anything foolish, Thomas, or you'll end up in here.
Pouncey'll be the one bringing you the undercooked eggs.
The eggs is fine.
I'll have you out of here in no time.
Another early payment.
Just some judicious scrimping and saving, that's all.
You'll have no problems from me.
You run a good, clean establishment.
Much better than Collier ever did.
Mr. Collier... had very little pride.
Well, it's not easy to get a doctor to do that kind of work.
It is when you own the man who runs a hospital.
I need my women clean.
I can't lose my precious inventory to disease or whore-babies.
My customers trust me to bring them a healthy product.
Once a week, I will bring women to you to be examined.
I can't just give my services away for free.
I would have to make certain arrangements.
What do you propose?
Perhaps, a two dollar reduction in my debt for every girl examined?
A gunner's knot... is difficult to tie but impossible to undo.
Drink.
My father made me memorize every sailing knot before he let me set foot on one of his boats.
Where are we?
The Atlantic.
What the hell is going on?
I'm cleaning up the mess you've created.
You take me back to Chromartie and you get me my drugs... or I will kill you.
I swear I will kill you!
It's tricky business.
Meaning you won't be killing me and that you only have two options...
Get well... or jump off.
Please untie me.
I'm feeling much better.
I could use... some more whiskey.
At least you're more in control then you were yesterday.
The need... will never go away.
Then you'll fight the need!
Don't you dare tie me up again.
I'm going to make this simple.
Then I'll no you're in control again.
10 knots!
Where were the bodies found?
All over the hull.
Were these 2 seen anywhere on the ship?
Some do take... to cooking rats if they can't steal from the kitchen.
It's not *** you think?
I'll need to see the ship's manifest and a list of everyone who went through immigration.
This is private property.
You tow it out of here or we'll toss you out on your ass.
Shut your trap!
There's been some sort of monkey business going on around here.
- What do you mean?
Uhm... come in.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning.
Any word from Gallinger?
He's used up his last chance with me.
Whose assisting you with the turburcu*** patient?
I only saw my name.
I'll put Maise on it with you.
Maise?
Not you?
It's a fairly routine procedure, I'm sure you can handle it.
Great.
That's quite an abscess.
Let's hope we won't have to amputate.
Perhaps I'll begin.
Nurse, knife.
Unless you have other thoughts?
Oh, I think that sounds right.
I'm a... well-acquainted with your father.
We were recently seated near each other at an Art Society dinner.
Will you be *** I'm cleaning now.
Yes, of course.
Do you need assistance?
Thank you for being here, Mr. Mayor.
This groundbreaking is made much more special by your presence here today.
You couldn't have done this in April?
I'm freezing my balls off.
Well, I am sorry about that.
Yes, and it won't cost you a dime.
Oh, is he here today?
But his son Henry is here instead representing the family quite well indeed.
People will know the names of the men, of the families, really, who gave generously to build this hospital.
Aside from our name on a plaque and our portrait in a hallway, there's no real payoff.
The payoff, Prettyman, is assuring your place in God's kingdom.
Yeah, well, your family can think about legacy, but I'm still building my fortune.
Every penny I have is tied up in winning the contract to build the new subway line.
Where will it run?
From city hall all the way up to 145th Street.
Do you have all the funds you need?
Enough to rig the bid, but short of what I need to get it done.
Guess who.
I didn't expect you so soon.
I wanted to be here for the groundbreaking.
I swear to you, I will never leave this city ever again.
Well, I won't let you.
- Where's Phillip?
- Oh, he's taken the baggage and is getting us settled in our new apartment.
Cornelia?
Oh, he's as surprised as I am.
She's back for good.
Stand there together.
How's the apartment?
Dad felt terribly about the delay, so he insisted all our things be brought to their house immediately.
An entire floor has been prepared for us.
We'll be living in your father's house?
For how long?
Four months at the most.
Maybe five.
Gentlemen, if we could come to the lip of the stage for the photograph.
Now remember, this will be in every paper in the city, so let's give it our all.
It's only fitting that our acting chief of surgery shows us how to make a first cut into the earth.
Could've given it to the police chief.
One, two, three.
I've had a revelation.
Once again I do all the talking.
That's the only way this works.
Hand it over.
- Now, before that happens...
Where's this coming from?
You spilled the coffee, you ambulance-chasing piece of shit.
And walking across the parking lot, just now, boom, there's a notepad plain as day, lying on the asphalt where, I can only surmise you accidentally dropped it, detective.
Now, guys, that's all we know.
That is one bold legislature.
Anything you wanna say to me about what you found in here?
Now that it's all out in the open?
- Maybe not.
You gotta figure she wouldn't reach out to us if she had nothing to say.
Hopefully whatever you are didn't rub off on the rest of your family.
- Let's get the hell out of here.
Please leave now.
You ever have jet lag?
I guess that's what this is.
Maybe it's the altitude, man.
Could be the altitude.
We're a mile up, right?
Sorry about the kid.
He's young, looking to make his mark.
I like him.
I don't honestly know.
Well, Mike, if she's got nothing to say, this pretty well ends it here.
If I were to guess, I'd say she wouldn't tell you much.
Either way, that's up to her.
That's the least I owe her.
That whole precinct was a sewer.
Wouldn't be surprised if there's a few more early retirements.
Like the kid.
He's all right.
He's just gotta learn, that's all.
Some rocks you don't turn over.
What I said is none of your concern.
How could you not recognise the mind games, the scams the con jobs these people play?
So work with me here, for the both of us.
You're kidding, right?
What, you think you're gonna defend yourself?
It's in someone else's hands.
- What, like God?
Please don't say Hamlin Hamlin McGill.
Oh, I'm sending you my bill.
I'm sending you...
You better believe it.
It's me, your friendly neighbourhood ice man.
Chuck, you there?
I'm out here.
What the hell was that?
- What the hell was that?
- Just give me a second.
It's an experiment, really.
Is that a real thing?
Because that does not sound like a real thing.
It's a real thing.
Anyway, as you well know, there is a 60 kilovolt transformer 200 metres south-southwest of my front yard.
I've been trying to get acclimated to it.
I got up to two minutes today.
I can't go on like this.
I need to be useful again.
Chuck, I am so proud of you.
I have to be.
There's a lot of sensitive information.
You're not planning to leave them here?
- Yeah, I don't know, Jimmy.
- It'll just be for a little while.
I'm practically sleeping on these things back at my place.
So we good here?
See you tomorrow, same time.
Wow, this is, like, really nice.
- Why do you sound surprised?
I figure this may be just the place.
Well, won't you miss the nail salon?
Oh, I could always visit, you know, get some French tips.
It's a clean slate.
Yeah, I like the openness.
I feel like I can breathe in here, you know?
It's not some claustrophobic little closet that smells like acetone.
Room to grow.
Dream big, I say.
Now you're talking.
This is me.
I love it.
Gotta look successful to be successful, am I right?
Well, this definitely looks like success.
Great view.
Okay, well, whatever it is, you deserve it.
And I want you to see this one.
Here we are.
This is way better than the other one.
- You gotta go with the corner office.
- Well, my partner.
Well, you said you were interested in elder law.
Actually, I do owe them, literally, you know?
But it's a nice thought, Jimmy.
Just, you know, playing with ideas.
I want to see the kitchen.
They have stainless in here.
I don't even have stainless at home.
What does that mean?
We're not in a great position to win at trial.
But we came to you people because we were told you win cases.
Winning doesn't always mean getting a favourable verdict.
We try to achieve the best outcome for our clients given each individual case.
Frankly, we've worked very hard to stave off an arrest after the misunderstanding about your camping trip.
That's exactly what we told the DA.
A deal is what they got O.J.
What kind of deal?
The public outcry in cases like these is a big factor.
Down from 30 years.
And you most likely wouldn't serve all of it.
But he would have to say he was guilty.
It includes the stipulation that you return $1.6 million in misappropriated funds.
We told you Craig is innocent.
You're telling us there are drug dealers and murderers walking the streets but instead of them, they wanna put an innocent man in jail?
Murderers and rapists, and this is how they...?
- You have to take this to trial.
- Look you have a difficult, but nevertheless straightforward choice to make here.
But your other choice that is no choice at all.
If you go to trial, you'll most likely lose, and Craig goes to prison for decades.
Your children will grow up seeing their dad through bars on visiting day.
Two years from now, you can be starting over.
We don't need to discuss it.
You're fired.
- It's not personal.
- If you're unhappy there may be other directions.
Don't look back, honey.
All right, duck your heads, because here comes another number.
And the action never stops.
I hope you all took your heart pills because it's almost too much excitement, right?
Which one will it be?
Say your prayers, here it comes.
Oh, we have a winner.
Lady Luck has struck again.
Let's see a hand, so we know who's won.
It's the lovely young lady in the back.
Congratulations, miss, you've won a...
Yeah, it's an adorable notebook.
I love kitties.
I have two Siamese cats, Oscar and Felix.
Can you take that to Irene, and when you come back, cover...?
I'm gonna take a short break, because somebody needs legal help.
Offices of James McGill, Esquire.
How may I direct your call?
So how may I be of service?
We would like to hire you as our attorney, Mr. McGill.
We won't see his name smeared like this any longer.
Can we back up just a scootch?
We've parted ways.
May I ask why?
They treated us like we were guilty.
So your previous objections to my representing you are now...?
Oh, I'm sorry about my bluntness at our last encounter.
We thought long and hard about it, and we...
You promised to get us a not-guilty verdict.
I don't think I exactly promised that.
You said we would be Client Number 1, morning, noon or night.
But we've already paid you a retainer.
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I had a Big Gulp on the way over.
Picture The 25th Hour starring Ned and Maude Flanders.
Oh, Christ, the Kettlemans?
Jesus.
- I do, huh?
They left because they think they can win this case, but they can't.
I managed to scrape together, from practically nothing, I might add a deal they should feel lucky to have.
This is their absolute best bet.
Tell me about this deal.
Elder law?
So how do we get started?
Do you need us to sign that little paper?
I am... I am very sorry, but I'm afraid I can't take your case.
I highly encourage you to go back to HHM.
I'm certain they would welcome you with open arms.
No, we're not going back there.
But there will be no deal.
There is no money with which to make a deal.
Can we all three just parachute down from Cloud Cuckooland?
Because we know without question there is money.
I distinctly remember a spirited game of tug-of-war over this money money which we then discussed at length.
If there were any money there would have to be a full accounting of it.
Every penny would have to be present.
Every single penny.
You understand?
All of it.
Yeah, he gets it.
We are in this together, Mr. McGill, come what may.
Now, where do we begin?
- Where's Kim?
Why are you sending her to the cornfield, Howard?
You're gonna punish her because you lost those batshit Kettlemans?
You notice I'm not exactly crowing over how I snaked them away from you.
Here are your files.
I'm not gonna discuss my employee policies with you.
That prick firing you?
Best-case scenario is my two-year plan just became a ten-year plan.
- I lost the client.
- Not your fault.
They're not really playing with a full deck, those Kettlemans.
They'll do what they wanna do.
Hope you didn't promise them too much.
I doubt you'll be able to do more for them than we were offering.
That deal was their best chance.
Kettleman did a terrible job covering his tracks.
For starters they've got reams of cheques he wrote for false expenses.
I can't even challenge their admission into evidence because he wrote them to himself.
None that I could find.
It's the only chip those Kettlemans have. They refuse to play it.
Jesus.
Gets bigger every time I look at it.
Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.
What are you doing?
"The right thing."
Am I correct in assuming we're now square?
Square.
Oh, it's Mr. McGill.
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.
Last time I was here, it was well, not a contender for the cover of Good Housekeeping, that's for sure.
- Do you have news about our case?
- I do, in fact.
But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.
We told you, there will be no deal.
You did, didn't you?
However, circumstances have changed.
What circumstances?
To answer that, might I suggest that you go check on that money you insist you didn't take?
In the upstairs bathroom, under the sink?
Betsy?
What did you do with it?
You mean the money.
Oh, you don't tell us what to do.
Luckily, you have a very talented lawyer who has found a way to minimise the damage you've brought upon yourselves.
No, I'm talking about Kim Wexler.
Now, you're gonna go back to her apologise for your hasty decision to terminate her services and you're gonna fall on her mercy and take that deal.
You absolutely could, and I'd be in a mess of trouble a real pickle.
But so would you, Mrs. Kettleman.
Look on the bright side, you know?
You, you'll probably wind up running your own gang.
Christ, you should see my office.
No, it's not over.
Let's find another lawyer.
We have to do this for the kids.
They can't lose us both.
It's okay.
Law offices of James M. McGill.
Deference to the executive cannot possibly justify the injuries to Mr. Mahmoud or the death of his family members.
If you do not say that this is wrong, that this is unconstitutional, there is nothing to prevent this sort of senseless tragedy from happening again.
We ask for nothing more than reform and oversight.
Ms. Dunbar.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court, the security of American citizens is the reason our drone program and other covert operations exist.
But that security often comes with a cost.
At this very moment, the president is at Arlington Cemetery, laying to rest three Navy SEALs who perished on a mountainside in Afghanistan.
They gave their lives to save others.
And God said to Abraham, "Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and sacrifice him."
Then God, to prove his devotion to us, made his own sacrifice.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son."
Amen.
As you are aware, we have invoked the State secrets privilege during our request for dismissal.
But I have authority from the president to share some of the classified brief in order to reinforce the government's argument.
Are you certain you want to do that, Ms. Dunbar?
Mr. Mahmoud's family did not know Aziz was in the same building.
The drone strike is responsible for their deaths.
Mr. Mahmoud has suffered a terrible injury and loss.
While the government's action is tragic, it wasn't unlawful.
It was legal, it was necessary, and it was right.
It takes more than savvy to be elected president.
Don't forget, she has a national profile after the Walker investigation.
No one with this little experience has ever been a real contender since Ross Perot, and at least he had the money.
She could finance her entire campaign if she needed to.
All of these depend on the other branches, which keeps executive power in check.
The president has strong electoral and other political incentives to act in the public interest.
Now you maintain that, uh, we should give our president a wide berth?
I am not here to defend any one person, but rather the office of the presidency itself.
We must hold everyone in government accountable to the law.
But we must not manufacture our interpretation of the law to erode constitutional authority.
We can prosecute presidents, but not the presidency.
That's one of the things that makes her so attractive.
Well, if we can't knock her out, we have to figure out another way.
Traditionally, the United States has not supported military action in the Middle East.
But a neutral UN peacekeeping force in the Jordan Valley is an essential first step to sustainable, long-term peace.
With no further requests to speak, I put the draft resolution to a vote.
All those in favor?
Those against?
Those abstaining?
Ileana, France is in.
I need to be certain Israel will stand firm.
Israel will never maintain its commitment.
Israel wants what the rest of the world wants, sustainable security.
Trust me on this, I've dealt with Jerusalem for many years at the UN.
We'll see.
Going around the Security Council is a radical move.
It's not radical, it's justified.
You dust off some 60-year-old precedent and think you're justified?
The Uniting for Peace resolution was used to start a war.
Ninety-three nations on board already, including Israel, that's not semantics.
Claire, I'm getting a lot of pressure from the Kremlin.
Petrov doesn't want this to go to the General Assembly.
Give me a little more time to work on him.
Send her in.
- Heather.
When I listened to your argument, I also heard something else.
There was a moment when Justice Jacobs was asking you about drone strikes.
I think... he just lost his train of thought.
Justice Jacobs has Alzheimer's.
He came to me a few months ago to tell me.
Now, it's in the early stages, so you wouldn't even notice unless you know what to look for.
He wants to remain on the court?
Well, that's what I want to discuss.
He wanted to retire.
I asked him to hold on just a little while longer, until I could find a suitable replacement and now I have.
What do you think?
- Given our history.
When I said that was water under the bridge, I meant it.
You have the finest legal mind in this country, a deep understanding of the Constitution, and the Republicans wouldn't dare block your nomination.
After all, you prosecuted a Democratic president.
You're too good to be Solicitor General.
Let's make sure you have a job for life.
I appreciate you saying that, sir.
I just got an alert.
That's weird.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I know it should have come sooner.
There needs to be more oversight.
It definitely wasn't in my case.
How rigorous can your process be?
That has to be wrong.
Look, I don't think the Pentagon is being honest about--
Are you okay?
Phantom pain.
You know what I dreamed of when I came here?
Choking you with my bare hands.
But what I can't be is indecisive.
It also says that "the saving of one life is like the saving of all mankind."
You didn't ask me here to apologize.
You asked me here to forgive you.
I didn't order the strike that--
Only you have the power to stop what happened to me.
- Yes, sir?
- You show Mr. Mahmoud out.
The CPU core quota of every mainframe in Washington couldn't handle all that data.
Okay, we just need to narrow the search, man.
- It's too much ground to cover.
I need more, man.
- That makes me nervous.
If we don't try something new, we're not gonna find Rachel.
First week I was here, I asked one of the stewards if I could have some boiled peanuts.
I used to eat them all the time as a kid, and I'll be damned if there hasn't been a full bowl of peanuts here every day since.
They must have a pot boiling 'round the clock.
Mr. Justice, since we last spoke, I've done a lot of soul searching.
It was unfair of me to ask you to stay on the bench.
If you want to retire, you should.
I appreciate your consideration, Mr. President.
- I think she'd be an excellent justice.
She has a great sense of duty.
More than any Solicitor General I've ever worked with.
That I would be miserable if I weren't on the bench.
And we'll keep an eye on 2016.
Must I destroy this man?
Mr. President?
I won't stand by and watch you make this mistake.
I've thought this through.
You've established legal precedents that will outlive both of us.
What if somehow the news of your illness leaks?
And a life's work will be undone in a heartbeat.
Do you have some ulterior motive here?
Only your best interests.
But why the urgency?
I want to protect you.
I appreciate your concern, Mr. President.
Let me speak again to Ruth and I'll get back to you.
Thank you, Justice.
Call it whatever you want, nobody's talking.
We're trying to prevent misinformation.
This thing's shifting under our feet in Congress.
By the time I finish the morning brief, it's already outdated.
I'm not asking for a one-on-one with the president, but... the Secretary of Labor, Treasury, one of his economic advisors.
Give you special treatment?
I think you issued the moratorium because you're losing the battle.
It's 500 billion dollars.
Then let me speak to someone who can confirm that.
- The president needs us.
- So we'll talk later.
Michael Corrigan, the activist who organized the protest at the state dinner last month, arrested by Russian police three hours ago in Moscow.
The video is going viral.
He's a high profile gay rights activist, nationally and abroad.
And he's been very vocal in Russia over the last six weeks.
Here's the bureau file on him, sir.
Ambassador, do you think this could be in retaliation for what you're doing at the UN?
It could be.
The Russians are very upset about this resolution.
I'll see what I can find out from Moryakov.
Let's hold off on the press conference until tomorrow.
I'd like to deliver some good news instead of no news.
Well, I wouldn't think it was a coincidence either.
So what do you hope to achieve?
If I withdraw the resolution.
I think Moscow would certainly see it as a sign of goodwill.
Well, we don't barter goodwill for the freedom of American citizens.
Save Petrov from himself.
I'll relay the Kremlin's position to the president.
If we give in, the Jordan Valley plan is over and we show the Russians we can be blackmailed.
So we're just supposed to let Corrigan rot away?
I think if we continue to drive hard at the UN, we'll gain leverage.
And you'll take more if you back down.
But it does mean I have to get in front of the press with absolutely nothing of substance to say.
It's good to hear you laugh.
Good night.
Who specifically is communicating between Washington and Moscow?
Well, then let me be as clear as I possibly can be.
And what is also quite clear is that you must have failed etiquette class.
Why won't you speak to John Pasternak, Michael Corrigan's husband?
I apologize, sir.
- You went too far.
You wanted me to chew you out.
If that's what it takes to get us talking.
Which is why I need your credential.
- You're kidding.
- Do you see me laughing?
And I just spoke to Joel Weinmann.
- He wouldn't.
- You succeeded, Ayla.
I'm lifting the moratorium for every other member of the press corps.
The price was your credential.
- He has no grounds.
- You disrespected the president, the office, and most importantly, your fellow colleagues.
And do you think the head of the association is gonna admit anything?
You don't have any friends, Ayla, on either side of the fence.
- No, not just me!
You're fucking with the second largest daily in America.
You can get rid of me, but you can't get rid of the institution I work for.
You done?
Don't let your 15 minutes of power go to your head, Seth.
That's all it's good for, now.
Are you serious?
Fuck.
I need to speak to the president.
Through our laws, we seek to create a more perfect union.
Government officials who abuse the law, or, at the very least, exploit the edges of it for their own personal gain, tarnish our democracy and weaken the bonds of our great nation.
The Democratic Party must step out of the shadow of scandal and redefine itself.
I want her here when she's done with this stunt.
Embracing a new era of transparency, honesty and justice, this country deserves a president who has dedicated herself to those ideals in this court and many others, who has spent her entire life defending the law, and who now wants to dedicate herself to enforcing it.
Let's restore integrity to the Oval Office.
Use its power to root out corruption and lead by example.
Please, take a seat.
- My letter of resignation.
I can't run for office as Solicitor General.
Then you should reconsider running for office.
It's too late for that, I think.
If Jacobs was stepping down, which he isn't.
You spoke to him.
As Solicitor General, I'm friendly with all the justices.
I keep those relationships private so no one will suspect any bias toward me.
But Robert and I are very close.
He and Ruth have me over for dinner once a month.
So you already knew about the Alzheimer's?
He told me the day he was diagnosed.
I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.
You don't care about Robert.
You wanted to sideline me.
So you actually think you have a shot at this office?
You're in over your head, Heather, no matter what Birch and Womack are telling you.
Why should it concern you, Mr. President?
You've announced that you're not running.
- Is this personal for you?
You got Walker, but you couldn't get me.
I'm running because I know I'd make a good president.
And when you offered the nomination, I was overwhelmed.
It's what I'd been working toward my entire career.
Someone needs to scrub the stink from this office.
- I didn't threaten him.
- What would you call it?
I was trying to save him, in the same way I'm trying to save you now.
Once the news of his Alzheimer's gets out, which it will, because no matter how much we all try to lie about it, it's gonna leak, can you imagine what that's going to do to his reputation?
Help me convince him.
Take the seat on the court where you belong.
Is this how you live with yourself?
By rationalizing the obscene into the palatable?
I wouldn't have made it through the past eight months without my faith.
But I wouldn't have made it without this community, either.
- It was my first time, actually.
- Do you live around here?
- She just left me.
Out of the blue.
You know, one day she just said it was over and that was it.
I went through something similar not that long ago.
What happened?
A guy left you?
Nice meeting you, Lisa.
- Hello?
- Is this a good time, Ms. Dunbar?
- Who is this?
- Doug Stamper.
How did you get this number?
Look down the hallway.
Then why are you here?
- The real reason.
I've been out of the game for nine months, Ms. Dunbar.
I want to get back in.
You're forming your team, and I want to get in on the ground floor.
The leadership isn't enough.
You need the rank and file.
I worked in the whip's office for ten years.
I have files on every single member.
What they want, who they sleep with, what they eat for lunch.
I can be valuable to you.
How did you know I was meeting with Giallo tonight?
Running against an incumbent when I offered her a seat on the court--
She was going to run the moment Birch whispered in her ear.
I should've just announced her nomination before I even asked her.
Tell me what I can do.
Why did I hold back?
Why did I show Jacobs any mercy?
Francis, this doesn't sound like you.
It was because of Mahmoud.
I let him get to me.
No, you're right, of course.
Well, let's talk in the morning.
- Good night.
- Good night, Francis.
Yes, can you reach out to Bishop Eddis for me?
I'll hold.
Thank you, Meechum.
Still riding the Bonneville?
You should take me for a spin sometime.
At least you know you have a place in heaven.
What's on your mind, Mr. President?
Between you and me, that's the same sermon I always use at Arlington.
You put enough soldiers in the ground, you get tired of writing new ones.
- It was the first time I had heard it.
- Won't be the last.
I want to understand what justice is.
That's a big one.
I know.
There's our justice, the kind men create.
"Thou shalt not kill" seems pretty clear.
Who's to say?
If we didn't kill, others would kill instead of us.
There's a lot of killing in the Bible.
King David was a warrior.
How do you reconcile that with the laws that God gave Moses?
Even those laws require interpretation.
There are two laws we have to remember above all else.
He tells us to love God and to love each other.
You can't love the people you kill.
You sure as hell can.
And you have to love the people who are trying to kill you.
Jesus loved the Romans.
"Father, forgive them," he said, "for they know not what they do."
I ask myself that question a lot.
I understand the Old Testament God, whose power is absolute, who rules through fear, but... him.
There's no such thing as absolute power for us, except on the receiving end.
Using fear will get you nowhere.
It's not your job to determine what's just.
It's not your place to choose the version of God you like best.
It's not your duty to serve this country alone, and it better not be your goal to simply serve yourself.
Two rules:
Period.
You weren't chosen, Mr. President.
Only he was.
It's all yours.
Love?
That's what you're selling?
Well, I don't buy it.
Is everything all right, sir?
I was praying and it just fell.
Please have someone clean this up.
You're making a mistake, cyclops.
You don't want to hurt me.
If you knew who I was, you wouldn't be doing this.
I've been sent here by Gaia, your mother, to look for her oracle.
Come on!
I'm looking for the Oracle of Gaia.
To rescue her.
No, I'm the Oracle.
Our men are exhausted and hungry, Majesty.
Their weapons bound together with blood and raffia.
At the moment, all they can do is hang on for their lives.
A couple of victories would lift their spirits.
King Minos' men outnumber us ten to one.
But we're Athenians, General, we each have the strength of 20 Minoans.
Come back when you have a plan to break the siege and throw King Minos back into the sea!
No more cowardly schemes to hide men inside wooden horses.
I want something bold, something daring.
It's King Minos you should be terrorizing, not your own men.
They've no guts.
They're loyal at least, which is more than can be said for most in your court.
Everyone is impatient for you to work your magic, Medea.
There seems to be nothing inside our son but childish dreams of eagles and drowning old men.
But you will eventually unravel its mysteries, and when you do, we will only have to click our fingers, and our enemies will be swept away.
Go on.
An eagle hovers over a lake filled with fish, large fish, and... swimming among them is a man...
Who?
An old man.
I think he might be drowning.
Go on.
Don't you dare fall asleep.
Sorry, mother.
Carry on.
What next?
I don't know.
I've lost it.
Are we getting closer to solving the riddle of the lexicon inside me?
You are a wasteful, selfish boy, Lykos.
Hide down there.
Where are you going?
East, so, uh, thank you for everything.
I just said that so you'd get me out.
Don't look at me.
Goodbye, good luck, and may the Gods clear your way.
Can we move the Arcadians from the east wall?
We would leave it too exposed, Majesty.
Majesty!
Majesty, get down!
Dear God.
What do you see?
People screaming, flesh burning, and you in the middle of it all, stone dead, your face as blue as your feet.
That's some vision.
I can see now why the priests want you back so badly.
It's not a vision, it's just common sense.
I'm supposed to be in a perpetual state of divine trance.
How much did they offer you?
Why did you run away?
The priests beat me every day.
And when I was too weak to care whether I lived or died, they'd rape me.
Who told you that?
The priests of Gaia.
And you believe them over me?
You've lied to me before.
I was protecting myself!
What makes you think I care what they do to you?
I know you well enough, Mercenary.
You're a good man at heart.
In fact... you're not even a mercenary.
What am I?
Cursed.
Anything else?
Your name...
Wait, what is your name?
No.
It's your name that's cursed, isn't it?
What?
I've never tried.
Very wise.
All you've proved is that you belong in the Temple of Gaia.
Leave the animal and go.
She is protected by Poseidon and Keto, and she carries the mark of Keres.
We'll take our chances.
Will we skin her first?
I can see that.
Perhaps then you'll impress your acolyte by being the first to charge.
I'm no acolyte!
Don't let him get to you, Theo!
Yes, take the advice of the invisible man, Theo, and keep your distance.
Why was he within range of enemy fire?
Outside.
Fetch my pharmakeia.
Hurry, Alexa!
Will he live?
Queen Medea is with him.
Thank you, Alexa.
I don't need your help.
Majesty, if the king's life is at risk...
Go.
Of course.
Perhaps now you'll find something better to do than hang around with cut-throats and thieves.
That's the thanks I get for rescuing you?
When you get home, spread a little honey on your wounds.
I'm coming with you.
I'll have a better chance on my own.
You're not an assassin.
You were not in the vision.
Did you not see me coming, Oracle?
You must be losing your touch.
If he wakes, give him a little water.
And, Alexa, from now on, you only take instructions from me, understand?
Heavenly Apollo, give the King strength and keep him safe.
I've heard that my brother is much recovered.
However, there are some in his court who feel that Athens can ill afford a leader who governs from a sickbed.
In the meantime, you should take care.
I've heard that you, General Dion, as the King's closest confidant, may be a target.
Me?
Really?
And of course, there are those who blame you for taking the King so close to the enemy.
I didn't take him, I tried to stop him!
What is it?
These are dark times indeed.
I'm risking my own life by warning you.
We must both be on our guard.
It's a trick.
Pallas is using you to get to me.
You think he knows about us?
Show a little courage for once.
I'll get a bodyguard.
A bodyguard in your own home?
What will your wife say?
She hoards gold, and plots her escape every day.
Who can blame her?
Stop worrying and come here.
How soon before the King's back on his feet?
A while.
Which may be a blessing in disguise.
Where did you learn to use a rope like that?
It was all I had growing up, so I made the most of it.
You grew up alone, didn't you?
Another vision?
Just common sense.
You're quiet and headstrong, not the sort who's had to fight for attention with brothers and sisters.
And for all your skill with a rope, you tie your sandals like a woman, so I'm guessing your father wasn't around, or he'd have beaten that out of you.
And... you grew up in the Forest of Troezen.
The only place remote enough for a wild boy with a rope to run around all day and not meet another living soul.
Where did you learn to do that?
As an oracle, you have to know how to read people, or you don't last very long.
Sometimes, things... come to me.
Like... like your name, for instance.
The curse of... whatever you're called.
How did you escape the wild man?
The... wounds you gave him, he lost a lot of blood, got weak, and I ran.
You're also a very good liar.
He and his friend were on their way to rescue me from the cyclops when they bumped into us, so he improvised.
My brother's not very good at improvising.
Come on.
If we pick up the pace, we might make it to the Temple by nightfall.
Where is the King?
He's called his generals together.
I tried to stop him!
Why are you up?
Where are Pliny's forces?
And where are the archers from Thebes?
You need to rest.
I must show my strength!
It's too soon.
Just sit.
The King cannot see you after all.
Is everything all right?
Who's this?
This is Captain Horos.
Your new bodyguard?
I am training him in the Pyrrhic method.
The King has asked me to keep an eye on his affairs at this difficult time.
I'll let you know as soon as he's ready to meet.
Thank you.
What?
We're going to run through.
Why?
You can run, can't you?
Then I won't even be able to walk.
All right, we'll walk.
Not until you tell me what's in there.
I killed him.
I killed him!
What did you do?
Mercenary!
Poison?
Yes.
If you cut the side of his throat, he'll die more slowly.
When did you get like this, Theo?
Mercenary?
Okay, I'm breathing!
You have to get up and move around as much as possible.
Theo, get over here!
Hurry!
Enough!
I can stand on my own.
Get off.
Drink.
Sleep.
Let your dreams heal you.
There are harpies in these woods, you know.
Hector saw one feeding on a stag.
The road to Athens is littered with furies and mind-altering demons...
You are not coming with me!
Get that into your crushingly stupid little brain.
As soon as we are clear of these woods, you are going home, do you understand?
Run, Theo.
Come, Mercenary, let's see what my knife will do to that pretty rope of yours.
Holy Mother, ruling from Ida's Height.
Greatest and more glorious in Olympus, be my witness, and watch over the keeping of these oaths.
Be on your guard, even in this most private of sanctuaries.
When smoke crosses a fallow field, the crows take to the sky.
I wanted to ask your opinion about something.
The Minoan arrow that wounded the King?
Minoan?
Are you sure?
Raffia.
Does the enemy use raffia to bind its arrows?
No.
In time of war, it would have to be someone who could command the confidence of the people, and their priests.
You're not suggesting that Lord Pallas, the King's brother...
Whoever it was failed.
You think there might be another attempt?
If it was Pallas, the ideal scenario would be for someone else to kill the King, someone who's perhaps close to Aegeus, and a known opponent of Pallas.
And then Pallas could step in, and kill the man who killed his brother.
Not you, but someone acting for you, someone who would make it seem that they were doing it with you.
Your bodyguard, for instance.
Pallas knows that you're a coward at heart, General.
That if he warned you of a conspiracy, you would recruit a bodyguard.
And you fell for it... because you, my dear general, are as dim as you are gutless.
No!
It's no wonder we're losing the war with you, General, at the tiller.
Dear heart, you're still weak.
Nonsense.
My generals are gathering in the war room.
Perhaps you should sleep a little first.
The King will not be joining us after all.
And so we shall, but first, a toast.
We have averted an assassination attempt on the King.
Sadly, although one of the assassins was apprehended, his accomplice was not.
Indeed.
However, the assassin confessed to his master's identity.
Poison?
Shouldn't you at least give the accused the opportunity to defend himself?
It was General Dion?
His bodyguard was the assassin.
He is gone.
Well, after such a sinister betrayal, it's perhaps no surprise that my husband has chosen the man closest to him.
His son, Lykos.
The King considers that one of his most important qualities, free from greed, ambition and hubris.
We salute you.
Queen Medea.
Home sweet home.
Priest!
Tie her to the mouth.
An old man, grey hair.
A beard.
Oracle... my mother died before she could explain the riddle of my life, so I come to you, great Oracle of Gaia.
I could have answered your question when we first met.
Only the breath from the mouth of Gaia can guide the Oracle.
What, is that not true?
Well, the mouth helps, but you could have let me try!
Oracle!
Answer the traveller's question.
I'm very disappointed in you.
What was your question again?
Why was I brought up in hiding?
You are the son of... a man of great power and wealth...
Aegeus.
Your father is the king of Athens.
And as his first born son... you carry the Sacred Lexicon inside of you.
The Lexicon?
A thing of unimaginable power.
- What does it do?
It leads to the doors of Olympus.
Come on.
All you have to do is eat, and sleep, and drink, and describe your dreams.
Out of my way.
Please, son of Aegeus, the alternative is imprisonment and torture.
Are you threatening me?
I would rather you were our honored guest.
Submit, son of Aegeus, or your friend dies!
Very wise.
No!
...and will be performed by Dr. Schoenweiss and Klein with Dr. Haas assisting.
I'll be in surgery B with Dr. Jacobi performing a thyroidectomy on the Itskowitz boy.
You can all call me Bertie.
Only in your off-hours.
In the hospital you will be Dr. Chickering.
At Mount Sinai, we're a bit more formal than the Knick.
Certainly.
Anything else?
I am not a Jew.
It will be helpful.
Another one of Dr. Chickering's gifts is for lab work.
It's an interesting substance that's been taken from the glands of several animals by a Pole named Cybulski.
I have no idea what he calls it, but we're calling it adrenaline.
You'll help us learn if it has any practical uses.
So be prepared.
The first day of school is always the hardest.
Do I look that lost?
No, it was more the disappointed look on your face when you were told you'd be working in the lab to start.
Did Dr. Zinberg notice?
Well, you concealed it well.
He's letting me know that I'm going to have to earn my way into the operating room and letting them know that he's going to ease me into the fold.
There's thought in everything he does.
He's a very deliberate man.
Is that why he has you taking notes of his meetings?
Why, because I couldn't possibly be a surgeon like you?
No, I just meant... no, I'm sorry, I... you're a surgeon.
Look at you.
Yes, is that more surprising than being a surgeon?
Are you the girl who went undercover for that article about sanitariums and lunatic asylums?
Genevieve Everidge?
Why, do you want to meet her?
Well, I just imagine that she's a very exciting person to talk to.
Oh, she is.
Even Cleary was speechless when he opened the coffin.
You're certain it was the correct grave?
It's like someone knew there'd be people looking for Speight and wanted to make certain he couldn't be found.
Yes, well, obviously they wanted you to leave this alone and so do I.
Speight didn't just drunkenly fall overboard.
Again.
When?
Thank you.
Give us one more smile, love.
You are yourself again.
Are you tired?
It has been an eventful morning.
Perhaps I should lay down, gather my strength.
She does seem better, doesn't she?
I'm praying for her.
Our family certainly doesn't want to have to have her locked away for good.
But what she is now is not acceptable.
To whom?
To us.
Everett, she's a baby killer and a madwoman.
Facts known not just in New York anymore.
They're talking in Philadelphia?
Ethel's fiancé broke off their engagement.
And I'm living in hope like some pathetic spinster.
She will get better.
We're all hoping.
But I know Eleanor wouldn't want her collapse to affect Ethel and me the way it has.
We meet again.
Mr. Robertson.
Well, how could you not?
Then you brighten mine.
Don't you believe me?
I'm holding a full bedpan, so it's harder to believe than you realize.
Look, you're a quick and clever girl and I like that, but when will you stop being clever and give me a chance?
There's no shortage of not so clever nurses around here all hired by you who've already given you a chance and then some.
But you're the one that has me intrigued.
Then tell me, Mr. Robertson... do you believe in God?
Do you read the Bible, go to church and lead a Christian life?
You're hesitating.
So I'm gonna take that as a no.
Which tells me you should most definitely give up the chase.
She broke into Hackett's office and gave herself a heroin injection big enough to kill an elephant.
Fucking putrid scene.
Where's the body now?
Family is sending someone up from the city to collect it.
Turns out, her real name is Marianne Horner.
Family's got some big copper mining company.
Absolutely not.
You want to cut our dead daughter open and root around inside her like some jewelry box.
It's enough that we've had to live with her cocaine addiction.
She allowed men into her mouth in exchange for the drug.
Our friends believe that she's been away in Virginia at college and came down with the flu.
How do you suggest we explain that there will be no funeral because a doctor wants to open her up and study her insides?
Mrs. Horner, you feel the same?
Look, you have my heartfelt sympathies, but you must understand that I'm trying to save girls like your daughter with my work.
But let's be frank here, your daughter isn't the only person in the family who has a problem.
You have as much interest in finding a cure as I do.
You help me, and perhaps with what I learn, I can help you.
I'll work as fast as I can and you can bury her in a few days.
You won't cut her face?
I'll protect it with my life.
You promised I'd have my fee, Mr. Cleary.
You've heard of the Showalters, yeah?
Probably own this building.
Be that as it may, if I don't have the amount at my office by tomorrow, your nun will need to find another lawyer.
You're here now.
All rise.
The Honorable Parkinson Bothamly presiding.
Be seated.
Mr. Whitting, you asked for this pretrial hearing, correct?
I did, Your Honor.
In front of me are 16 past cases thrown out due to proven entrapment by the New York Vice Department.
But an examination of the files will clearly show uncommon similarities between those wrongly accused citizens and my client Sister Harriet.
I think it only fair...
Do not tell me what is fair in my courtroom, Mr. Whitting.
"Lo, children are a heritage from the Lord and the fruit of the womb is His reward."
Excuse me?
Psalm 127.
I'm surprised the devil allows you to remember any verse, Miss Dolan.
But hear me, the devil will not influence me in my decisions.
I will use this courtroom and the strength of my God to sound a warning against the people now flooding our shores and let real Americans know exactly what you are.
The trial will formally commence on the 15th.
Next case.
What the fuck just happened?
You haven't seen the new club yet.
But you'll see ours is far more tasteful.
Is this how I used to do it?
Of course.
It looks wrong to me.
It looks lovely.
I can start again.
Are you all right, Ellie?
I just want everything to be right for you, Everett.
You always used to love to show me off to your classmates.
Now I'm afraid there's not much left to brag about.
Nonsense.
You will always be the most beautiful girl in the world to me.
But I've lost so much weight.
My dress will be hanging off of me.
And my color...
What would I even say to them?
That I've recently been locked away?
And the dinner... what if one of my teeth comes loose?
Looking well, Everett.
We're now in practice in Rye in our own hospital together.
Must be a fine institution.
Certainly made of stronger stuff than we are.
Henny, it's lovely to see you.
Mary, how are all your people?
Political, as always.
There's usually an Ingersoll campaigning for something somewhere.
Where is Eleanor?
I'm afraid she left me to face the class of '91 all by myself.
Well, it's only for one night.
Pardon me.
You've seen the streets of this city.
The dregs of the world are coming here.
Every country emptying their slums into our ports.
Don't let me interrupt.
We were just discussing eugenics.
Drexler and I are both teaching courses on the subject this year.
Do you know much about it?
Heard a few things.
Breed the best with the best to get the best.
But it's just as important that the laggards, the worst of our species, don't get the chance to continue their line or contaminate a better one.
And Negroes are the largest threat?
There's a reason that as a people they've never succeeded.
Science is proving their weak intellect and innate lack of character.
If they continue to breed, if they, heaven forbid, begin to mix in with us, we'll forfeit potential greatness for the mongrelization of our species.
Forgive us our preaching.
Drexler and I are both a bit evangelical on the subject.
Rockefeller, Carnegie, Harriman, they're all putting money towards teaching.
Colleges and medical schools are adding eugenics courses in droves.
Speak freely, brother.
Confess yourself without fear.
You're in the presence of God.
Anybody else I could dupe.
But I succeeded nothing outside of destroying myself.
Who else among us... needs to unburden themselves tonight?
I have a heavy heart.
The heart of a sinner.
She's seen some vile, awful sickness, but nothing comes close to the disease Satan can infect in you.
The cure... confession.
Open up that medical kit, Lucy.
Take out that medicament and cast the devil out.
Go on, Cricket.
Right, are you ready?
I can't believe you haven't been here before.
Here we are.
So when you did your exposé, how were you able to gather all that information without anyone becoming suspicious or getting drugged yourself?
Well, I seduced the orderlies with filthy stories and erotic pictures.
Really?
No, I paid them off.
Ahem, a well-offered bribe can be an art.
I'll think of something.
But you liked the article?
Oh, I loved the article.
But I don't want people thinking all medicine is like that.
Psychiatry is a very new field and things always look worse at the beginning.
Not all things.
No, not all things.
And if it happens to show a Jew who isn't a Lower East Side ghetto peasant, all the better.
Before I met Zinberg, the only Jews I had met were destitute patients at the Knick.
You?
But you aren't?
Maybe I am.
No one knows and I don't want them to.
When you read Genevieve Everidge, she's anything you want her to be.
And I doubt people would feel the same way about Esther Kohn, a shirtmaker's daughter from Pittsfield.
I would.
Said Columbia University's Bertram Chickering Jr.
The only Presbyterian surgeon at Mount Sinai Jews' Hospital.
How lucky am I?
You're always so sweet to me.
Well, I do love to be with you, however infrequent.
I should be more attentive.
I do like that.
And when I do this?
That's nice, too.
I work in a hospital.
I went and saw Sister Harriet today.
Why would you do that?
She's my friend and she's really up against it.
The judge was brutal.
Well, she's not a very sympathetic defendant.
And her lawyer costs more than she could ever afford.
I was thinking we could help her.
What?
You're asking me to help fund a baby killer.
How can someone who wants to have a baby possibly sympathize with someone like that?
Did you know that she was aborting babies?
Stay away from her.
Only God can save her now.
John?
Abby.
Thanks.
How long were you away?
Too long.
Really.
Insomnia.
The headaches are much worse.
There's no cure.
And we both know where I'm ultimately headed.
Looks like it was a good night.
People give more when they feel worse.
Just as long as they feel better when they leave, right?
I know I feel better.
Do you?
I do.
I felt lighter, safer.
I felt free.
Girl, you is far from free.
The spittle you let fly from your wretched mouth was the most disgusting, humiliating sewage my ears have ever heard.
Daddy, I had to confess.
How else could I be welcomed back into God's arms?
You think God is just gonna... forgive a stupid girl like you?
You not only made yourself look foolish, you made me look worse.
Every time you speak, it makes my skin crawl.
And tonight... tonight it took the power of the Almighty for me not to squash you while you was chirping away in church.
The Polish doctor discovered the gland secretion existed.
Genius.
We're just looking to see if it cures his sniffles to start.
So how was your little excursion to Huber's Palace with the girl writer?
She's like no one I've known.
The things she's seen.
I'm worried I'm no match for her.
We might consider trying on larger animals or even humans.
Dr. Zinberg is very specific about his protocols.
Well, we could at least try injecting the drug in different doses.
Just the sniffles, Chickering.
You can be aggressive around here, but we don't go in for sloppy or stupid.
Of course.
What do you mean no match?
You trying to bed her or beat her in badminton?
I'm not trying to bed her, Leo.
I get mine every Tuesday at a Negro brothel on 29th Street.
As experiences go, it's worth every penny.
The papers are signed.
You have your subway partner.
Did you convince your father to sell some of his ships?
I've been able to find some savings for the company which I think could be put to better use elsewhere.
And I'd like to keep it that way.
If he wants to stay blindly adrift in the 19th century, that's his business.
Now here's to ours.
It shouldn't be difficult to excise from the base of the tumor.
Yes, there it is.
We will now bisect the healthy liver tissue leading to the tumor and tie off all blood vessels contained within.
Or we could simply strangle the vessels leading to the tumor and not bother the healthy liver.
Which would be lazy.
As opposed to slicing the liver further, which would be idiotic.
Yes.
I will now bisect the healthy liver tissue leading to the tumor... and tie off each blood vessel contained within.
I think I might be onto something.
Thack.
Yes?
Why do you always go to him?
What do you mean?
Why do you always choose Edwards over me?
Well, this is simply something for which he's better suited.
It was me who saved you.
And I'm eternally grateful.
Everett, if you want to collaborate with me, then jealousy won't serve you a tenth as well as ambition and effort.
Our goal is to kill that bastard.
So I read in this Austrian journal that several syphilis patients inexplicably improved.
The only link was that all had been suffering from various other illnesses... strep, pneumonia, meningitis.
No, that wasn't what killed the syphilis at all.
I thought it was indestructible until finally it died on its own one night while I was working under the light of several lamps focused on my work.
Syphilis can be killed by temperature.
How high?
106, 107 degrees Fahrenheit.
Yes, and the patient in the process.
You are talking about lethal temperatures.
Yes, to cure a lethal disease.
Suppose you could induce the fever using something curable.
- Like what?
Well, let's try it.
No, no, that could take years.
I don't have that time.
You?
No, Abby.
She's developing motor coordination problems.
You know, the blood vessels in her brain are swelling and clotting.
Where do we start?
Where we usually do, with a pig.
Yes, changes are always expected during construction, but what you're asking is quite extensive.
Well, the board thinks the matter important enough to implement the changes.
Well, I understand the Inebriety Ward, but some of these things you're asking for make very little sense.
Changing ceiling heights, moving walls, why?
It's all very disruptive, not to mention it will cost a fortune in materials and manpower.
The board wants what it wants.
Then I should speak to them.
I fought these on your behalf and nearly found myself out on the street.
I don't want that fate to befall you, a man who does not have nearly the history with these men that I do.
Thank you for your counsel.
The changes will be made.
Make me a list of the extra materials you'll need and I'll send them along to the contractors.
Where is the tender?
It's Mr. Blackledge, sir.
I think he went to piss.
You're the new tender now.
- Understood?
- Yes, Mr. Wingo.
Go.
Well done, Frazier.
I won't allow negligence.
Perhaps just to be safe, we should slow construction down a bit despite the cost.
We don't want to take any unnecessary risks.
I have always said a little bit of fear can be a very good thing.
You got to come to Tammany Hall and make your accounts for this here building.
You'd do well to remember that.
Mr. Barrow gave me very specific instructions that I must have a written report of the patient's ailment before I can dispense any of the narcotics.
And only to a doctor or a nurse.
Now, having those drugs on the ambulance could be the difference between putting them on the ward or putting them in the morgue.
Good news, Herman.
I was at the club last night carousing with the fellows and we got to talking about you.
I've now got enough backers to bring you in to interview for membership.
Really?
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me.
Excuse me, I am next.
Herman.
It's just that I've been so distracted with my school studies and doing my hair just right for you.
Please don't be mad, Hermie.
You know how special you are to me.
And to the judge and to that fat fellow before him and to the Spaniard before him.
Yes, I have been waiting that long.
Are you jealous?
I just thought you would always want me at the head of the line.
I am not an idiot, Junia.
I'm well aware this is a job for you.
You are.
I dream of your hugs and kisses.
Yes.
I wish I could be with only you all the time.
A life with you is all I dream of.
It is not your fault you ended up here.
Is that really what you want?
You want to be with me?
More than anything in the world.
Then you will be.
There we go.
Shit.
Our syphilitic sow is now three degrees above normal.
We have no idea if quinine will even cure malaria in a pig.
Well, in five more degrees, we'll load her up with it and find out.
In the meantime, we let the fever rage.
You've got a visitor.
Excellent.
And I'll return in an hour and take the pig's temperature.
You know, if people actually knew what you did in here, they wouldn't trust you to give them a fucking aspirin.
Yes?
Put it through.
Dr. Edwards speaking.
What?
Right now?
Algie went on and on about how pretty you were, but he didn't do your silhouette justice.
Algie, look who's here.
Opal.
Hello, sweet.
We finally get to meet this wife of yours after hearing about her for all these months.
It's been so long.
Let me get my arms around you again.
She sailed into Boston on the Saxonia day before yesterday.
But I learned my mistake.
This country is so big with so many cities.
I came here straightaway.
To my parents?
Who greeted me like family.
Because that's what you are.
That's what I am.
Down the hall just to the right.
Won't be a moment.
Who on earth is that woman?
She is my wife just as she said she is.
You think that's something you might want to tell us, that you got married?
Boy, that's not something you just forget about.
I guess I hoped that she would.
It happened so fast.
We were in Paris.
And then you run and run.
How in the world did you think this wouldn't catch up with you?
I don't even know what she wants.
I know exactly what she wants.
That girl is determined.
What did I miss?
I feel much stronger today and I'd feel much better still if I were at home surrounded by my things.
Well, I'd feel better if I could keep watch on you.
Oh, now all I need do is lay in a stock of gin and limes and I can make a party of it.
Worry about your other patients, John.
I'll look in on you later.
One second.
In the last century, neurologists have revolutionized our understanding of the human brain.
Using electric currents, they discovered that precise points of the brain can be stimulated to reveal their specific functions.
Seated in front of you is Mr. Sidney Carton.
Mr. Carton was recently involved in an accident that resulted in the loss of the top of his cranium.
Fortunately, for the benefit of our experiments today, his brain was left unharmed.
I will now deliver small currents into the patient's brain to demonstrate.
We only have a vague idea of what happens in any given area.
As you know, the brain itself feels no pain, so Mr. Carton won't feel a thing.
Electricity can also affect our emotions.
I will now demonstrate.
And what about desire?
Mr. Carton is a morphine addict.
He injects himself multiple times a day.
But for the past 24 hours, he has been denied the drug.
As you can see, his need for the morphine is immense.
Other than discharging electricity, this device, a rheoscope, can detect it.
Gentlemen... it seems that X marks the spot.
Have you eaten anything today?
It's her time of the month.
Cramps?
You having your monthly?
Nobody's properly taught you about the functions of your body?
Cannabis indica.
I'll write it down for you so you remember.
Why not some hashish, too, while she's at it?
Are you fit enough to continue with work?
Yes, Sister.
At the very least, give the poor girl leave to fetch a couple aspirin.
And I'll thank the likes of you not to instruct me in matters of theology.
I was just trying to help the poor girl.
Like you helped all those unborn babies?
Don't let me catch you talking to these girls again, Dolan.
Did you hear me, all the rest of you?
Henry, this is inspired.
Imagine the fortune you'd make showing this on the Bowery.
You've single-handedly brought self-abuse into the 20th century.
Pun intended.
What I don't understand is why you didn't jump in there yourself.
Well, somebody had to crank the camera.
I volunteer.
What'll it be, sir?
Care for a White Lion?
Or perhaps a White Tiger's Milk.
Just a couple of whiskeys.
My father will be scandalized.
So, what is it that you wanted to talk to me about?
I've had some bad news.
My mother has laryngeal cancer.
I'm sorry, Bertie.
That's terrible.
What course are you considering?
I thought perhaps that you might have encountered more pioneering procedures during your years abroad.
Have you consulted with Dr. Zinberg about this?
No, Dr. Zinberg is the kind of man who wears both suspenders and a belt, if you take my meaning.
He would never approve a procedure that hadn't passed years of rigorous laboratory experimentation and peer review.
I have to say I feel like it's because he's a Jew.
I believe being a universally despised race has stiffened their resolve to never act rashly and risk being thought a failure in the eyes of a hostile world.
Some months ago, I read a paper coauthored by Pierre Curie on the treatment of malignant tumors using radium and other radioactive substances.
I could translate it from the French if you could find a copy of it somewhere.
Bertie, you smell just like McSorley's Bar.
Have you been in a saloon tonight?
How do you know what McSorley's smells like, huh?
I didn't think they permitted women in there.
I have ways of getting into places.
Bertie, how on earth did you do that?
Well, I, too, have ways of getting into places.
You find anything?
No, but you're still researching adrenaline, aren't you?
This is it.
So how often do you engage in criminal activity?
Not often.
Please don't tell my mother.
If she found out that I'd become a second-story man, she'd be heartbroken.
Henry Robertson.
What?
Yeah, let me call you back.
I'll go in the back.
- What happened?
But it ain't gonna end any time soon.
- No, we'll need them for recovery.
Fetch every operating table in the hospital and get them into the theater.
You're gonna let me drive?
How in the hell do you drive this thing?
- So what do we have?
- His pelvis is shattered.
How deeply embedded do you think this is?
Hopefully not as far as the lungs.
I don't see any external trauma, but stand by just in case.
Lung's collapsed.
Trocar.
Dr. Thackery.
10 grains of morphine.
That compound fracture can wait.
Let's get some pressure under his head.
You live with Nurse Nash, don't you?
No need to get changed.
Nurse Taylor, I have four more sets of hands for you.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Your hospital administrator owes me a total of four simoleons.
I'm sure he'll get around to paying it in three weeks or so.
Three weeks?
Or you can have your money right now from me.
What's the catch?
Cash on the barrelhead.
Dr. Thackery.
Finish up and dress the wound.
Yes, Doctor.
Put him under.
No time for that.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna use this wire as a probe.
If it comes in contact with any metal, then it'll close the circuit and we should be able to hear it.
Come with me.
Just what I wanted to talk with you about.
Have you any thoughts as to how much we should charge the subway construction company?
Charge them nothing.
Beg your pardon?
This is nothing less than a civic duty.
Nobody makes a profit here today.
Quite a day.
I for one am glad to see it end.
And now we come to the hour of our settlement.
That's 124 patients in total.
Cleary, you can't honestly expect me to believe you carted 124 patients here by yourself.
Let's just say I made a little arrangement with the other fellas.
How much did you pay them?
Two bits a head.
Unfortunately, I think you'll find you squandered your capital.
The fuck are you talking about?
If you have any complaints, you can take it up with Henry Robertson.
Fuck me sideways.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
How are you feeling?
Here's laudanum.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Just the bedclothes, please.
Put that away, John.
Please.
The only thing I can think to do for her now is to help her sleep through the pain.
She could never abide laudanum, you know... but I don't know what else to do.
Dad, I've been studying a paper that was published this past year in Paris about radium and the treatment of cancer.
Well, well.
Now what do you have to say?
I bet you'd feel the prize booby today if I had let you invest in that subway scheme.
What ships are expected today?
The Phoenicia out of Hamburg and the L'Aquitaine out of Le Havre.
The L'Aquitaine was expected last week.
The entire fleet needs a month in dry dock.
Well, what about all the new ships, Henry?
What the hell is taking so long?
They'd already be seaworthy if you built them when I first told you to.
You can imagine how we stand with our creditors.
Now is not the time to be timid.
We should sell at auction every last rusty bucket and put the money into new technologies.
Such as the subway?
150 wounded, six dead.
The city will be settling lawsuits from now until the day we can fly to work.
Let me remind you what Baron Rothschild said.
The time to invest is when there's blood running in the streets.
I need to get going.
Of course.
Thank you, Abby.
Seems like a fair trade.
What will I have to do for dinner?
Sorry.
Old habit.
No sores or warts.
What do you see?
Nothing that's bad.
You're lucky.
We're gonna have to start the two other girls on mercury treatment.
Thank you.
If you ever have any burning, itching, or pain down there, you come to me immediately.
No work.
Maybe work a little.
No, no sex.
You don't have to have sex to make money.
Well, you can't guarantee that a customer won't want intercourse and that's a problem.
I make him want other things.
When he's in my hand, I control him.
That's when I can get anything I want.
Quite a weighty tome for a delicate dove like you.
It's a medical textbook.
You know, I noticed an interesting phenomenon associated with medical textbooks.
I don't think you'll suffer this one.
It's just a disease of the uterus.
Surely you're not unacquainted with that part of a woman's body.
Whatever do you mean, Nurse Elkins?
You've been through the nursing staff like Grant through Richmond.
And you think that has acquainted me to an unusual degree with female anatomy?
Stands to reason.
My adrenaline research.
I look forward to reading this over the weekend.
But if it's all I expect it to be, consider your position here significantly improved and in short order indeed.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Here's a paper published by the French Academy of Sciences on the treatment of cancer using radioactive substances, and it found that malignant tumors are more susceptible to the influences of radiation than normal tissue.
And I was wondering if it might be possible to use that fact to isolate a tumor and improve its chances of successful removal.
An intriguing hypothesis.
Let's talk about it after you've finished your work with adrenaline.
But I can tell you right now, the upshot is the poor bastard responsible for the dynamite storehouse on Park will be posthumously charged with criminal negligence.
And that, for all practical purposes, will discharge us from any legal responsibility.
However, I believe it will still be necessary to buy out the residents of Park Avenue whose homes were damaged.
By my reckoning, $1 million should do the trick.
Can I rely upon you gentlemen for a third part of it each?
I paid a visit to Mr. Speight's residence and I think you'll be interested to learn that his family and all of his belongings are nowhere to be seen.
I can't make out the holder's Christian name, but his surname is Petrizzi.
I looked it up and the ship arrived here just last month, so there's a possibility Mr. Petrizzi is still in town.
I found that in the inside pocket of Mr. Speight's jacket after the coroner sent over his clothes.
The pages have been mostly washed clean, but there is one entry there.
Pasteurella pestis.
Well, that's bubonic plague.
Is that the brain of Mr. Carton, your morphine addict?
Mr. Carton is still very much alive.
So... this corresponds to the part of his brain that lit up like a Roman candle when he was given the morphine.
I'm working under the hypothesis that by detaching the affected area, his cravings may be eliminated.
The risk is accidentally damaging another part of the brain in the process.
May I offer an alternative?
No, but it'll certainly prove effective of curing society of the likes of him.
That sounds like the eugenicist line.
Your race?
Well, I suppose this is progress.
In the antebellum South, they would cite the Bible as justification for Negro inferiority.
Your point?
Well, now instead, you justify your racism using some asinine pseudoscience.
I can understand why you're emotional.
Future knowledge always sounds like pseudoscience until it's accepted.
Oh, I have something you should accept.
Please.
What is it?
Equal parts vermouth and Old Toms gin.
You possess a very discerning palate, Lucy.
Do you know the history of this type of cocktail glass?
Well, it's modeled after the glass from which the Greek gods drank ambrosia, which is said to have been molded originally from the actual breast of Aphrodite, goddess of love.
Mr. Robertson...
Are you blushing?
You weren't such a delicate flower earlier today when we were discussing a certain point of female anatomy.
Because I believe I'm suffering from it right now.
Actually, I find the sensation rather enjoyable.
There they are.
Now, good night, Leonard, and good night, Ethel.
Oh, my.
Oh, my goodness.
Yes, I do work hard, my dear.
So what's wrong?
So what's the matter?
I just...
What are you doing?
I'm afraid I have some business to attend to.
Now?
I'll be late.
No need to wait up.
Herman?
Oh, God.
That's the story of the Negro in America.
Does what a man says matter?
So again, does what a man says matter?
Yes.
When a man's words or laws don't matter, forget about justice because people don't even know where to look to for justice.
The story of the Negro in America... is the story of America.
Dr. Everett Gallinger, may I present Mr. Samuel Reid.
Your advice on the matter would be invaluable, Everett.
- Won't you have a seat?
Sounds like a worthy institution.
The problem is once the boys reach manhood, we are legally bound to release them, which, unfortunately, leaves them free to engender more idiots like themselves.
I see.
Well, gentlemen, I believe I have a solution for you.
All right, dear?
Maybe a little port.
Forgive my appearance, Miss Everidge, but I didn't want to miss you.
I'm just glad you came back with your scalp intact.
Bertie was telling us that Genevieve also translated a paper for him from the Polish.
Yes, Dr. Zinberg was duly impressed.
A linguist as well as an adventuress.
After all, your savior was also a Jew.
There's some debate about that.
No, he was a Jew, all right.
I hope I wasn't being too presumptuous, but I saw you hiding your hands earlier.
It's very kind of you.
I'm afraid I haven't had the strength lately to take proper care of myself.
Well, I could come back next week and varnish them, if you'd like.
You mean paint them?
My mother would turn over in her grave.
You know, I don't think I've ever seen quite such a large handbag.
Would you like to see?
If you don't mind.
Well, my reporter's notepad and pencil, of course.
A lucky kachina doll given to me by the Hopi.
This is a photograph of my parents.
And a photograph of Bertie.
I don't know how my family's going to get on... when...
With help.
Well, thank you for the best meal I've ever eaten.
Well, the first of many, I hope.
Who died, Mr. Barrow?
What do you mean?
My father told me riches and honors depend upon heaven.
Consider yourself fortunate.
Mine was a violent man and a son of a bitch.
Did he come here to work on the railroad?
The California gold rush.
He insisted I be educated in accordance to strict Confucian principles in expectation of the day he would strike it rich and we would return to China.
He wouldn't even permit me to learn English when I was still young enough to master it.
But he never struck the mother lode and I fell in with gangsters.
I suppose I was a great disappointment to him.
Your debt to me is now repaid in full, Mr. Barrow, and this part of our business has come to an end.
Not quite.
I'd like to discuss a remedy to Junia's indentured state.
1,500.
2,000.
Very good.
Oh, I'll have the money for you shortly.
Gentlemen, the source of addiction.
That's how you would describe yourself, isn't it, Mr. Barrow?
That's right.
The nursery is on the ground floor and this is the parlor, a gracious stage for your wife to entertain upon.
My wife will never see the inside of this room, I assure you.
How much?
7,000 for two floors facing the street.
The ones facing the park are somewhat more.
Mr. Carton?
Mr. Carton, can you hear me?
Let's get started.
Will you come with me, Moishe?
Do what the nice man tells you to do.
Uh, yes, sir.
Sometimes, you know something's coming.
Well, you feel it in the air, in your gut.
And you don't sleep at night.
The voice in your head's telling you that something is gonna go terribly wrong.
And there's nothing you can do to stop it.
That's how I felt when my brother came home.
That was a special day for a special family.
Look, I don't know if your lieutenant told you why I wanted this face-to-face.
I'm in the dark here.
You're on a shortlist to be the next sheriff of Monroe County.
You don't seem too happy about that.
I understand he's missing.
Born and raised here, and that Rayburn name will go a long way.
I'd like for you to meet with a few people.
I never even considered running for sheriff.
I'd like for you to think about it.
I know we've had our differences, but this is business.
I'm willing to bury the hatchet.
As long as it's not in my head.
Look, what do you want me to say?
Those Silicon Valley pricks pulled out and we want to sell.
That puts you guys in a bad position.
Well, we'd be willing to negotiate.
Good.
We go back a long way, Kev.
We'd love the marina to end up with you.
- Freddie, how'd you do?
- Oh, man, I love this boat.
Rent her any time, I told you.
You know, you really should charge more.
It wasn't too rough.
The partners are surprisingly nice for New Yorkers.
They're actually not that nice.
Well, they're lawyers, so they're good liars, I guess.
I'll pour you a drink.
To taking a risk.
Don't like tequila?
Oh, who doesn't like tequila?
Come on, Surf.
- What happened?
You need to go to the hospital, okay?
Oh, my God. ls that Danny?
Jesus Christ. ls he dead?
Miss?
I'm gonna need you to fill out some paperwork.
Miss?
Meg, what's going on?
I was hoping we could talk.
It's been a crazy few days.
Shit that's been going on with Danny, you wouldn't believe.
What's going on?
A few days.
I'd really like to talk to you when you have time.
Kevin, come on.
See you later.
Detective Rayburn.
- Can you hear me?
Any pain in your chest?
Shortness of breath?
You were experiencing atrial fibrillation.
We shocked you back into rhythm.
Your blood work shows you didn't have a heart attack.
But hypertension can bring this on.
- How long has he been here?
- I don't know.
What happened?
I don't know.
We gotta do something.
- Did he talk to anybody?
Shit.
Grab his legs.
What do we do now?
That's Chelsea O'Bannon's car.
Danny must have driven it here.
I think it's better if no one ever knows John or Danny were here.
- What are you looking for?
He's gonna tell us what to do.
Go home.
- How's he doing?
- Can he hear us?
- He's on Serax, it's a sedative.
He kept trying to leave.
- Just two minutes.
John, I spoke to Meg.
If there's anything that you need, maybe you can give us a call, okay?
- You need to step out.
Oh, shit.
- When can I see him?
- There are forms that need to be filled.
She brought Mr. Rayburn in.
That's why we contacted you.
He seems okay, but we can't go in there right now.
They're running some tests on him, so it's probably best that you just leave him alone.
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna be-- l'll be right back.
Do you know why I pulled you over?
Everything okay, miss?
Yeah, I was-- I was coming from the hospital.
I was distracted because my brother's not feeling well.
License and registration, please.
John Rayburn, Monroe County Sheriff Department.
Don't know him.
Your treads are worn.
- How far are you headed?
- I just live two minutes down the road.
I can call you a tow.
No, please.
Please, I just...
Drive more carefully.
Get those tires looked at.
Hope your brother feels better.
Shit.
Oh, shit.
Where is he?
- You didn't have to come here.
- Let's get out of the rain.
Hey, honey.
I tried to reach Diana, but she's not answering.
How are you feeling?
Good.
The doctor told me.
He thinks it was stress-related.
Not surprised, after last night.
Did you talk to Danny after he left?
- I know you're keeping things from me.
Last night you said Danny was gonna come in and talk to you.
He didn't show up.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but I can't help him anymore.
You don't just give up on family, John.
Mom, I can't help him anymore.
I'll check in with you later.
No, no, I just-- Putting my suitcases in for New York.
NO, tomorrow afternoon.
Since when do you plan so far ahead?
Why are you asking me so many questions?
Please get out of my fucking car!
I'm gonna need for you to stay in bed.
- You got all your tests, don't you?
- I'd like you to stay overnight.
Detective Rayburn.
Why did you move him?
We didn't have a choice.
There were people coming.
What happened?
That's not important.
We understand that whatever you did out there... you felt like you had to do.
We all know what Danny was capable of.
Did he have a weapon?
Did he attack you?
Meg, leave him alone.
Were you defending yourself?
John, Meg and I had to make some decisions.
Without you.
Chelsea O'Bannon's car was parked near yours.
Danny must have driven it over there.
- What did you do with it?
The best thing would be do nothing.
What should we have done, John?
Should we have called the cops?
I am not throwing my life away.
We understand what he was capable of.
The shit he pulled with Janey?
The drugs at the inn?
We are the only ones who understand.
Not a judge, not a jury...
Not Mom.
Jesus, I have to meet her tomorrow to talk about the fucking pier dedication.
You two are free of this... because you didn't do anything.
We're not free of this, John.
We just covered it up.
There's no guaranteeing that this isn't gonna come back on us.
And when it does, I don't wanna have to try to explain... why I had my brother's body in the trunk of my car.
There is no story that makes that okay.
We're with you, John.
We have to get rid of him.
No body, no crime.
You don't understand.
Is that true, John?
I'm gonna need your help with this.
What is it?
Let's do this and get out of here.
I don't know if I can do this.
Oh, they want me to say something tomorrow.
Listen, I wanna help you, but you have to turn yourself in first.
You've got a big decision you gotta make here.
I understand.
Listen, Danny... you either run, or you talk to the feds and face the music.
See you back at the house.
What?
The night he came here... they found a man murdered in Danny's motel room.
I'm so sorry to be the one to tell you that, Morn.
How did he sound to you?
He sounded scared.
Look... the good news is he understands the situation.
I think I got through to him that the best thing for him to do is to speak to the authorities on his own accord, and he agreed to that.
It looks like they'll allow him to come to the pier dedication.
Then they're gonna want to sit down and talk to him.
That sounds like it's the best thing to do.
At least you'll get to see him at the ceremony.
Mom.
Make sure he wears his suit.
His seersucker suit.
Yes, please, the suit.
Thank you, Meg.
Do you have it?
He must have taken it with him.
I'll tell him to wear it.
Thank you.
This family should be a role model for all of us.
What makes the Rayburns so special is their dedication, not just to each other, but to the whole community.
And now I'd like to invite Sally Rayburn to the podium.
Come on up, Sally.
Well, I see a lot of familiar faces out there.
Thank you all for coming.
Where I've been lucky most of all is with my family.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
This is such a great honor for all of us Rayburns, and I know Robert was so thrilled.
Yeah, of course it's okay.
It was nice, and... maybe a little reckless?
What do you mean?
Are you-J?
Yeah, I am.
When is he gonna do this?
I need to go and speak to some folks over at the DEA and explain the situation.
I'll see you back at the house.
You all right?
You two?
Listen... we did what we needed to do.
And it's behind us as of right now.
You're not worried about them finding the body?
You two need to get on with your lives.
I don't know how you can talk about deserving anything.
You can't think like that.
He's right.
You deserve to be happy.
You too, Kevin.
What about you?
I'll be fine.
I took you for granted.
I love you.
Folks, I think you're looking at the next sheriff of Monroe County.
Or from... recent newspaper accounts about my brother.
As well as his being wanted in connection with the murder at the Red Reef Motel.
I know you all have questions.
I'd like to address those concerns now if I may.
Floor's all yours, John.
I always thought the greatest thing that happened to me was being born a Rayburn.
Now I'm not so sure.
I'm gonna tell you everything.
It's not very pleasant.
But it's the truth.
Sometimes, you know something's coming.
That's how I felt when my brother came home.
And my brother Kevin is the hothead of the family.
Truth is, he's a lot like my father.
Danny turned us into that family.
And I'm not the same man now.
People say he's a monster.
He did terrible things.
In a way it wasn't just him I was trying to save.
I was trying to save myself.
What do you mean by that?
We never treated my brother Danny like he was one of our own.
So if he went astray, we all bear some of the blame.
I wish I knew what happened to him.
Thank you for meeting me halfway.
I'm so sorry that I avoided you at Robert's funeral.
I was ashamed.
What do you have to be ashamed about?
I told my children to lie to you.
After Sarah died.
I made them tell you that story.
Danny paid for it.
I understand, Sally.
I just don't know what I can do to help.
Have you talked to John?
I think John's given up on Danny.
Sally, what do you want me to do?
I want you to find Danny.
Before something terrible happens, please, find him.
Is your mom doing any better?
I just keep thinking about how he was found.
That's so... awful.
But it would have been harder for Sally if he'd just gone missing again.
So I don't know.
Maybe it's better this way.
You still don't have any idea what happened to him?
John, what is it?
Hey, Diana.
I'm gonna need you to come in.
We have some questions to ask you.
Medical examiner sent us his report.
The cause of Danny's death wasn't burning.
His lungs were filled with water.
He drowned, John.
Do you have any leads?
This thing's got a lot of moving parts, but... all the signs are pointing in the same direction.
What direction is that?
John, you said that Danny was going to the pier dedication, right?
He knew you were gonna interrogate him after.
I thought he said he was prepared for that.
Look, what Danny says and what Dan--
What Danny said and what Danny did were two very different things.
Never saw him?
Chelsea O'Bannon said that she warned you about somebody coming after Danny.
Is there something you aren't telling me'?
I'm beginning to feel like a suspect.
Well, we took a little drive up there.
No way Danny could have had that much shit.
Unless he stole it from Wayne Lowry.
Why didn't you get rid of it?
I thought it might be useful.
I just didn't realize I'd be using it for this.
After he moved it from your property, it-- lt appears he kept it for himself.
Chelsea O'Bannon got a message from Danny.
Yeah, but he came back.
We found Chelsea's car about half a mile away from where Danny's body washed up.
What did you do with it?
I moved it to Turtle Head Bay.
I still have the keys.
I found Danny's bag in the back of her car.
His possessions were in the car.
His clothes, his keys, his cigarettes, his cell phone.
We checked his phone records, John.
Listen, I'm thinking about going out to Indian Key and trying to catch maybe some pompano.
We lD'd the victim in the motel.
He's linked to Wayne Lowry.
Lawry's out two million in coke.
He sent this guy to go after your brother.
We think that Danny set up a meeting with Lowry, you know, hoping to make peace.
Wipe the slate clean before the pier dedication.
He tried to get rid of the body on the boat.
Same MO as the girls.
Well, hey, what are you thinking?
I'm not thinking anything.
I just lost a brother.
I'm sorry, John, but the pieces fit.
You're probably right.
We're bringing Lowry in now.
Let's see what he has to say.
He was wearing a suit.
Seersucker.
Yeah, I can't do this right now.
No, work days are longer up here.
I've got kids to get home to, so I'll see you tomorrow.
Why?
Well, it took you a whole month to call me.
It's nice to have a different view.
You glad you took the job?
Think you made the right decision?
Good.
A buddy of mine has a place that's a block away.
So nice to cook in this kitchen again.
Yeah, don't get used to it.
ls there really something in there?
There she is.
There she is, the woman I love.
Grab a knife, make yourself useful.
Do you really want to be sheriff?
Honey, I'm not gonna do anything unless everyone agrees on it.
I say do it.
You cared.
And you tried.
I couldn't have asked for more.
Danny made his own choices, Sally.
You can't blame yourself for this.
I couldn't help Danny, but I found out some things.
What?
Your children are lying to you.
I'm meeting my friends.
That means nothing is important.
I'm just trying to have conversation.
- Are you John?
- Can I help you?
Danny Rayburn was your brother, right?
That's right.
I need to talk to you.
And what is it you want to talk about?
What happened to him.
And why is that?
He was my dad.
Date is November 11th, 1983.
Interview with John Rayburn.
And what happened?
He was hit by a car.
Yes, sir.
Will you send in your brother?
You saw the car hit your brother?
Yes, sir.
Danny was screaming and crying.
I never saw someone get hurt that bad.
Mama.
I still knew it was wrong.
How did that go?
I apologized.
And?
I think he was all right with it.
What?
It could have just as easily been me on that boat with Sarah.
I'm glad that you guys finally had a chance to talk about this.
I feel like things can be better now.
Thanks, Mom.
This'll be a big help.
Oh, shit.
Where are we?
A boat.
You know, I gotta make more cash.
Of course he fucking did.
He offered me a chunk of change to leave, though.
Why didn't you take it?
Do what I gotta do.
This shit's the best I can offer you, pal.
That trafficking ring that brought in Cristina Colon?
Pensacola.
This one was killed by another inmate in Tallahassee in a labor camp.
This is Ray Jenkins.
Ray got himself an early release.
I imagine you wanna go talk to him, huh?
Some night, huh?
You can answer.
I don't know, probably six or seven beers.
What did you see when you came out of the restroom?
The Mexican guy grabbed the victim, threw him down and pulled a knife.
Mr. Mejia's Cuban.
But you're saying that you saw Mr. Mejia draw a weapon.
Well, then, I'm just wondering what hand he might have had a knife in.
His right hand.
And then?
Then he said he wanted his money, or he'd cut up the victim.
So the victim gave him what he had.
Did you see Mr. Mejia use the knife?
No, he just grabbed the cash and ran.
Your phone records from that night show that you made another call as well.
Then how exactly did you know where to reach her?
What the fuck was that all about?
Is it really your business?
Did you spend the night with that asshole?
What do you care?
Well, I care, because Captain Fucking Rayburn is the douchiest shit bag in that whole fucking family.
You did.
Nothing?
No, he's not gonna find out, right?
I don't care if he finds out.
That's my best friend we're talking about, you know?
Your friend made it clear that he wants nothing to do with me.
So save your fucking lectures for someone else.
Why don't you start looking for your own place too?
You'd have to make improvements on the existing structure.
That won't be cheap.
You know, kick the tires, whatever.
- You're from around here?
It's a local place for local folks, and I'm really trying to keep it that way.
Ray, OPEN up now.
- The fuck is this about?
On a beautiful day like today?
Are you still trafficking girls?
Who's running the women these days, Ray?
Listen to me, you asshole.
You got weed in there, I'll fucking send you back.
Recognize them?
- Anybody recruit you when you got out?
I'm sure someone did, but they ain't come knock on my door.
Don't raise your voice, Ray.
Fucking orchards.
You know, fruits and guavas and shit like that.
No offense.
That's the least offensive thing about you, Ray.
We brought them to five or six.
I asked you who's the biggest one, Ray.
Bezler, I guess.
- No?
- You sure?
Tell his parole officer he's been smoking dope.
You're serious?
Fuck him.
I gotta go.
You're a fucking piece of work, dude.
This fucking little prick disrespects you, and you're just like, "Oh, yeah."
I got bigger things to worry about, man.
But when your dad decided that he was gonna get your mom... no matter what, he pulled out all the stops.
And so she had tickets to a concert in Miami.
And your dad decided he had to have a new shirt.
He had to have a new shirt for the occasion.
He wanted something that looked nicer than what he usually wears.
Which wouldn't be hard.
I have no idea what these two are talking about.
So he had no money, because he spent all his money on his new engine.
He wasn't gonna ask our dad for money, so he starts asking me for some shoplifting tips.
Well, that's kind of romantic, stealing for your woman.
That much might be true.
He didn't have to steal anything, because I stole it for him.
How was the concert?
I think that's the first night they kissed.
I remember that night.
Yeah, I remember that shirt.
This is all you need, right here.
Who does this fucking guy think he is, huh?
We talked about this.
You have a good time.
I've got a few tricks.
Thanks for the tip.
Took me 45 years to figure that out.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, honey.
You want me to get rid of this guy?
What'd you say to her?
Every time that kid leaves, it puts a pit in my stomach.
She's always gonna come home.
I mean, look what she's got to come back to.
How the fuck did it not destroy Mom and Dad?
Anything ever happened to one of my kids, I don't know what the fuck I'd do.
You got the safest kids in the whole town.
That was nice, right?
Yeah, it was.
What are you thinking?
Nothing.
I'm just glad you're happy.
The only thing the prosecution has is an unreliable witness who happens to be dating your accuser's sister.
She's reasonable.
And what does this mean for my bail?
Am I still on the hook?
I hope I'm not a distraction.
Meg told me about your case.
My mother wants to sign a character affidavit.
We all make mistakes.
Where are you staying?
With Manny and his folks.
Well, that's what family's for, right?
Not all families would do that.
Good to see you, Carlos.
You went behind my back.
That was some deal you conned my mother into.
I'm paying your mother a lot of money.
It's nowhere near the amount I secured.
Spare me the sanctimonious bullshit.
This land is all she's got.
Well, I guess she didn't want her legacy to be another fucking yacht club.
Or she didn't feel great about putting me out of business.
You're a piece of shit, Rayburn.
I can't help it if your mom likes me better than you.
Fuck you.
You better hope you don't get that loan.
How you doing, man?
How's my sister doing?
I really don't know.
I mean, she's been really restless lately.
Really?
I don't understand women.
And I sure as hell don't understand my sister.
- Who was that?
- Oh, Manny's, what, brother?
No, I saw Mom handing him an envelope.
- Mr. Bezler?
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Detective Diaz, Detective Rayburn.
It's been in the family for generations.
Seventy-two, '73?
My grandfather had a baby blue '66 C10 with whitewalls.
Seventy-five Caprice Classic?
1946 Chevrolet.
- I'm afraid that just isn't possible.
- Well, why is that?
This is private property.
If you don't have a warrant, I'm gonna ask you to leave.
If we do that, might as well invite all the guys here too.
Yeah, he plays softball with some guys from INS.
Can't hit for shit, but they are sticklers for detail--
All of my employees provide paperwork.
John, you know, I envy your guys.
They're gonna come here and they're gonna have a fucking field day.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna let you make the decision.
What does that say?
"The good neighbor."
What does this mean?
I think it means someone's trying to help us.
No, we'll get it done by 8.
Okay, thanks a lot.
I actually wouldn't advise you going through with it, but you're so determined.
I'm barely keeping my head above water here.
So you take on debt?
Did you?
I just want us all to be on the same page.
Well, I don't wanna stand in anybody's way.
If it's okay with you guys, it's okay with me.
But listen, maybe it's all for the best.
Look at all of this shit.
My God, I have not seen the inside of Dad's shed since I was a little kid.
The man was very particular about who he let in.
The other night, I kind of hooked up with somebody that I probably shouldn't have.
Why are you telling me?
It was Chelsea.
Yeah, I saw her at this bar.
It was just so stupid.
Because it just dawned on me later, maybe that you guys had sort of something going on.
I don't think I said anything, but Belle and I are breaking up.
Headed for the big D. Got a lawyer and everything.
It's been a-- lt's been a pretty rough time.
It's the worst.
See you, man.
Your sister home?
She's at work.
Why aren't you dressed, man?
We got work to do.
What?
Don't shoot the messenger, okay?
They're done with us.
Word is, the docks are hot.
Whatever fucking docks they unload their shit at.
Cops have been sniffing around, they wanna shut us down for a while.
Hey, you gotta introduce me to these guys.
- When?
- I'll get your cut by midnight.
Tonight, I'm meeting the guy and I'll get it to you.
I gotta go.
They weren't members of my congregation.
Well, unfortunately it was an anonymous tip.
Take one more look.
You in charge?
You got a lot of questions.
A man can't even take a shit without some stranger walking in.
So who the fuck are you?
I only got a few employees, and you ain't one of them.
So let's take this again.
Who the fuck are you?
I deliver gas cans out to the mangroves.
Lately, that line of work has dried up and I hear you may be catching some heat.
And how is that any of your business?
Well, I might be able to help you out.
I might be able to solve the problem for you.
Hey, look, I'm only trying to help, okay?
You wanna ask this guy to lower the gun, and I can talk to you?
I guess you really don't know who I am.
It's fucking late, you know that?
Is it too late for me to apologize to you?
I was...such an asshole.
Yeah, you were.
A really big fucking asshole.
Then don't.
I know about you and my brother.
Yeah, it was fucking stupid, but it happened, so...
Sometimes...things happen and you get clear in your mind.
You know who you are.
You know what you want.
And you know what you have to do.
So I'm gonna be around for a while.
If you decide you can forgive me, I'd love it if you'd call.
You and your brother... you're the closest thing I got to family.
All you have to do is tell me the truth.
Let's start with your name.
And you were there.
You saw the car hit your brother?
Yes, sir.
Danny was screaming and crying.
I never saw someone get hurt that bad.
You dropped your phone.
You don't really know who I am, do you, Stiles?
Maybe you heard about my father.
Did your dad tell you about him?
Did Sheriff Stilinski ever tell you about the time he was still deputy and how his partner got caught in a shoot-out?
Did he tell you a bullet shattered my dad's T-9 vertebra?
Went right through his spinal cord?
I bet he told you some of it.
But I bet he probably left out the part where he was sitting in a car calling for backup while my dad was going in alone.
Did he tell you that he was too scared, too much of a frightened little bitch to go in after him?
Or do scared little bitches not tell their little bitch sons about their failures?
About how they put their partner in a wheelchair for the rest of his life?
I'm just gonna eat your legs.
9-1-1, what is your emergency?
9-1-1, please state your emergency.
You've reached 9-1-1, this line is for emergencies only.
If you do not have an emergency, please hang up.
Let's see if we got a car in the area.
- What's wrong?
- It's the alarm at the Animal Clinic.
I think it's a break-in.
Someone's stealing the bodies.
The Dread Doctors by T.R. McCammon.
"In a small New England town, teenagers are taken in the night and buried alive.
I think we're living volume two.
What's wrong?
I thought I smelled blood.
Sorry, but I'd never even heard of the Kanima until a few days ago.
Yeah, I guess.
We thought about that, but it's pretty much a dead end.
What about this guy?
And I know where to find him.
Lydia, I'm going with you.
I thought you said you were sick.
- I'm slightly under the weather.
- You don't have to come.
What was that?
- What was what?
- You winced.
I have a bad elbow.
It was your shoulder.
You are not going without me.
You remember what happened to Deaton when he talked to Valack?
He almost killed you too.
I don't see it anywhere.
When we woke up, you said "Don't forget your belt."
You don't remember saying a lot of things.
You okay?
Can you do me a favor?
Can you look at me with your eyes?
I am.
I mean, your other eyes.
Anyone there?
I think we're all a little off.
Maybe some of us more than others.
- She doesn't know any Japanese.
Still not terrible.
Wasn't he trying to kill you, though?
I mean, that just sounds like self-defense.
Maybe she had no choice.
There's gotta be a point where self-defense is justified.
Please empty your pockets into the container.
Please remove your belt and place it into the container.
Please remove your belt which patients will attempt to take from you and use to strangle either themselves or others.
I'll remind you that I'm only doing this as a favor to Deaton.
And I'm doing it against my better judgment.
Hey, what's the etiquette for talking to this guy?
Page turner?
Not exactly.
Neither is this.
You didn't think you were all going, did you?
It's mountain ash, isn't it?
Everywhere, but heavily concentrated down here.
Valack's cell is the last one at the end of the hall.
We'll be right here.
Happen to have seen any lost souls, Mr. Stilinski?
Everyone down here.
Where did you hear that from?
Wise words from a former cellmate.
Did you bring the book?
There is no T.R. McCammon, is there?
Maybe you've already guessed that it's not just a book.
To what?
To them.
The Dread Doctors.
- Need a ride?
- I can take the bus.
Last one left an hour ago.
I'll walk.
Haven't I seen you coming out of Driver's Ed?
And nearly take out a sophomore.
The sophomore shouldn't have been standing there.
Sounds like you could, uh, still use some practice.
- Why did you use a pseudonym?
- I had a professional reputation once.
I wasn't interested in ruining it by putting my name on a second-rate piece of trash.
Then why write the book in the first place?
You haven't read it yet, have you?
What are they?
They found their secrets in electromagnetic forces.
Ways to prolong their lives, give them power, and most importantly, making you forget you ever saw them.
Everybody wants something, don't they?
Okay, so what do you want?
Hit record.
What do you want me to say?
To be honest, I feel a little weak.
Yeah, it's like being sedated.
This was a bad idea, wasn't it?
Yeah, they are.
No super strength or samurai swords, but they stay alive.
I mean, you should've seen the way he used to be around her.
Was it bad?
He was kind of obsessive, but not all bad.
You know, Lydia used to pretend not to be smart.
He remembered...
Did you see that?
No, but I am seeing this.
He's the only one that knows anything.
How many have died so far?
Want to know how many died the first time they came here?
Wonder how many will die if they succeed?
This did happen before.
The Nemeton.
How do you even know about that?
I know because I saw it.
Kira, whatever you're doing, please stop.
Who did you come with?
Don't answer.
You brought a Kitsune.
What's happening?
They knew you were coming.
They're here.
And you unlocked the door for them.
We can go a little faster, if you want.
I'm doing the speed limit.
Nobody does the speed limit.
You also don't have to hold the wheel like that.
Put your hand here.
Like this.
Better?
Malia, you okay?
Hey, slow down.
Malia, stop!
Stop the car!
But it's worth something to you, so you're not getting it for free.
What does the book do?
I wrote the book in an effort to find out if anyone else like me had ever seen them before.
You didn't see it on The New York Times best seller list, did you?
So all we have to do is read the book?
If you've seen them, if they've done something to you, then the book will help you remember.
Now give me what I want.
We need to get her out of here right now.
Yeah, well, how do we move her if I can't even touch her?
Who?
The Desert Wolf.
- I think you better run.
I can.
Tell us what they want.
- Read the book.
Read the book!
You don't have to do this.
And I meant it.
I think we're okay.
No, it's not okay.
All of this, it's on us.
It's our responsibility.
You never think these things will happen to you.
Some terrible thing happens to the family down the street.
And you think, "Thank God we're not them."
Then one day you wake up, and you are them.
And you can never look at yourself the same way again.
Kevin, can you hear me?
Shit.
What the fuck happened in here?
Shit.
It's really fucking stupid walking in there like that.
Well, I'm a stupid guy.
I'm surprised you're not at the bottom of a reef with a harpoon up your ass.
So you think he's gonna put me on or what?
- What's he doing here?
What's going on?
We're just getting to know each other.
Yeah. ls that cool with you, gas man?
Fuck that.
There's other ways.
Follow me.
What the fuck are you doing with this asshole?
No. lt just sort of happened.
- What the fuck does that mean?
Come here.
What the fuck is that?
Compliments of Kevin Rayburn's boatyard.
Where's this asshole taking us?
I don't know.
Hope you've got somebody to help you get dressed.
You've got three cracked ribs.
Your wrist isn't broken, but there's a lot of tissue damage.
Yeah, well, you gotta do it anyway.
I'll need you to blow into this twice a day.
The most common complication of broken ribs is pneumonia.
Gotta keep the lungs moving.
- Is that it?
- Wait, sit down.
You got into a fight?
If you were assaulted, you can press charges.
Jesus Christ.
See this fucking bird right here?
Can I get a beer?
I'm fine.
I'm trying, man.
Hey, you know what?
I'm glad you're trying.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know anything about this by chance?
This one?
You don't know anything about this girl?
And ever since he got here, he's been trying to earn enough money to get them over here.
He says that he paid $3,000 to bring his daughter into the country.
That wasn't it.
The man he paid, did he try to contact this guy?
Number, no work.
His guy disappeared.
Are you going to deport me?
Tell him we just wanna find out about his daughter.
Ask him if he'd recognize him.
He says he knows where it is.
Plus your one side.
Can't forget about your one side.
So, what's this new direction gonna cost us?
In fact, it's gonna be cheaper.
Well, these were the vendors your father trusted.
It's not like Robert's here to object, so if you think you can do better, just have at it.
I'm gonna check out some seafood prices.
And then I am gonna draw up some menus, and you're gonna love it.
This is gonna be fun.
I'm not sure I like the sound of that.
You're Aaron Davis, right?
What do you want?
I thought maybe you and I could have a little chat.
Thank you, Tom.
- You're a lucky girl.
It's really over.
They have no witness, they have no case.
Sometimes things work out right, Carlos.
Thank you.
But you have to take this seriously, okay?
If you do anything like this again, they're gonna come down on you hard.
Of course.
Hey, how's the case going?
They got the charges thrown out.
Congratulations.
What are you gonna do with your freedom?
Not sure.
I started looking for a job.
Something will come up.
Who would've done this to you?
- They take anything?
How much?
I don't even know.
Why?
This place is collateral for my loan.
So you'll let whoever did this just get away with it?
Whoever has a name, trust me.
- What are you talking about?
You're the boss.
Yeah, I think that's a lovely idea if you think you can use him.
Thanks, Mama.
What?
You say something?
There's no deal until there's a deal.
The inlet stretches over a mile.
Thank God she does not look like her father.
He's very good-looking, just like you.
But one of us is a little better-looking than the other.
Oh, look who's there.
Well, thank you.
I mean, she's dying that you're here.
Hey, Mama.
Hey, honey.
- Why didn't you call me sooner?
- Because I didn't know what to do, man.
- You're gonna have to file a report.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Check this out, he comes up here the other day, walks right up to me, I'm working on an engine, gets all up in my face, he fucking threatens me.
What did you do to him?
Just asking, what did you do to him'?
He fucking came at me, man.
He didn't like the deal I made with his mom.
If it was him and you wanna prove it, file a fucking report.
If you don't want me to report anything, why did you call me?
- Hey, buddy.
And then he hit me again.
Then I blacked out.
- John, why would anybody do this?
- We're looking into it.
Sounds personal, an attack like that.
Yeah, I gotta say, I agree with Meg.
It just doesn't sound random.
Remember when you told me you weren't gonna make it to my niece's birthday party and I told my whole family?
I saw the disappointment all over their faces.
You weren't gonna be there because I pushed you away.
And then you went anyway because you didn't want to let my family down.
I've been an idiot, baby.
What do you mean?
Now you're being an idiot.
Let's get fucking married.
I'd tell you to take care of her, but this one can take care of herself.
"Wanna get married?" A man needs to think about these things.
Do you see the man that you paid?
And this is where you met, right?
I come before.
You came on a boat, right?
Alone?
Cuban accent.
Well, it looks like you've been hurt pretty badly.
I heard there was some kind of break-in?
Mr. Rayburn, it's a small town.
It was just, literally, a minor incident.
Somebody broke a window, took just a little bit of cash.
It was, like, a couple kids or something.
Well, it's probably just a formality, but we need 90 days to go over the damages and see about your collateral.
Can you show me?
If you need 90 days, the money's not gonna be of any use to me anyway.
Fuck!
I don't think this guy's gonna show.
That's the man.
You don't think you and I had anything to do with it, do you?
Because we used to pound the hell out of him when he was a little kid.
Thanks.
Let's go get a beer.
Hey, what's going on?
You seem like a man with a whole lot of worries.
I've got no worries.
Like this situation with Kevin, right?
I bet you think that's your responsibility to deal with it, don't you?
What about fucking Kevin?
Depends what reality you're talking about.
I'm talking about if the guy pissed off his neighbor, that's on him.
Don't you think?
John, your fucking problem is you've never left.
You've got a small-town mind-set.
Well, when you got responsibilities, you just can't pick up and fuck off around the world for new experiences.
Voila as they say in fucking Calgary.
Oh, motherfuck.
I made up a room for you.
Thank you.
Richard Froman had to go into rehab for a broken ankle.
I'm so sorry, honey.
Oh, fuck.
All right, give me one of those.
Really?
Just one.
Hey, how many years have you been fucking the same woman for now?
- How many years?
Seventeen years, though.
Mind you, hey, if you have to pick someone to fuck for the rest of your life...
Diana, fucking beautiful.
You did well.
What's "a thing"?
Bullshit.
But there was a fucking moment.
Listen, you know, there was a moment.
But I didn't go there because I'm your fucking brother.
That's all I'm saying.
That's all I'm saying.
You and me, we would be a great combination.
You know how to look at women.
You're a fucking asshole.
You gonna have another one?
Fucking asshole.
Why didn't you tell me you and Belle were having a hard time?
I didn't want to let you down.
- Let us down?
I failed.
Dad's never gonna even get to meet my children.
You know how important family was to him.
How important could it have been if his own son couldn't even talk to him about what was going on in his life?
You can stay here as long as you want to.
Thanks, Mom.
And you didn't let me down.
Just fine.
No, I'm saying I fucking stood up for you, Danny.
The family business.
The fucking family business.
So I'm out.
I guess I should thank you, huh?
Because you're just making everything else okay.
You know, you gotta watch out.
Because you are not a man that's used to being out of control.
But you're not in control now.
Come on, Johnny.
I'm being so quiet.
You gotta watch this guy.
- Danny, the kids are asleep.
- Keep an eye on him.
Oh, honey, you stink.
- Whoa, she's on the ball, that one.
Sweetie, go to bed, please.
Your daddy imbibed a little too heavily this evening.
What'd you guys even do?
We had some fun.
Good night.
Shit.
Sorry you have to sleep next to that tonight.
What happened with you guys?
What are you doing?
And I appreciate that.
I really do, but it's time for you to leave.
That's Janey's birthday party, right?
Sorry I couldn't have been there for that.
Some stuff came up.
Refreshing.
Good night, Diana.
Good night.
Mom?
Hey, where's Mom?
I thought we had an understanding.
- What do you mean?
Are you mad at me for some reason?
You don't think you could have told me?
All I have to do is draw up the paperwork.
And when are you gonna do that?
All I know is we had an understanding.
Well, I guess I know where we stand now.
How's your head?
Kids are gone already?
Hope you had fun at least.
What happened?
Pretty obvious, isn't it?
I haven't seen you like that since your 40th.
How'd that happen?
I went out drinking with my brother last night.
And I think that we had a pretty good time.
And I think I drank too much.
What?
There's something off about him, John.
No, you didn't see him after you went to sleep, okay?
He had this look in his eye, and he had an attitude with me.
- What attitude, honey?
- He was aggressive.
I think you want things to be better with him so much that you don't see him clearly.
I see him clearly.
I know you want things to be better.
But the guy you brought home last night, I don't want him around.
I don't want him around the kids.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't want him around the kids, John.
We'll talk about this later tonight.
How's the catch look today?
They're beautiful.
Just don't make me sorry for doing you a favor.
That's two shipments' worth in there.
Let's see how we did.
What the fuck, dude?
That's sugar, pendejo.
So I passed the test?
Are we in business?
I'll be in touch.
You sure?
You got some balls, bro.
I guess.
Danny turned us into that family you don't wanna be.
He made a big mistake.
And now we're all paying for it.
Wayne, you got any of those charter schedules?
Oh, great, great.
And you got any mackerel I can put on one riggers?
- Nothing better.
Guy who owns the bait shop is Wayne Lowry.
Why don't we get Loo to authorize a surveillance team?
There's only one empty desk at the moment, but whatever you need, be my guest.
- Someone already beat us to it.
DEA needs some office space.
- What for?
We met at the regional commission.
I think we saw each other this morning.
At the bait shop.
You wouldn't be looking into Wayne Lowry by any chance, would you?
You want a cup of coffee?
DEA's building a case against Lowry.
Big distributor down here.
- He's the top of the pyramid?
- May not be King Tut, but we flip him and dominoes fall.
I think he's doing more than dealing drugs.
I think he's good for being involved in these murders.
As far as we know, he moves drugs, not people.
Why is it he can be involved in one and not the other?
I'd let you talk to the guy once we bring him in.
- I hate to be the guy to take your case--
- Then don't do that.
- Sometimes I gotta hate myself.
- I'm not stepping away from this.
- Guess who the Fed is?
- That's the way you're gonna play this?
How about I introduce you to Vicente Cruz, huh?
Who the fuck is that?
This girl's father, that's who.
All right.
So now we're trying to locate the new point of entry.
So locally, who are you looking at?
Couple of scumbags.
Maybe you've seen them.
- Name's Rafi Quintana.
- Works for Lowry.
Victim's father lD'd him as accepting money for human trafficking.
How about this guy?
- You know him?
- That's Eric O'Bannon.
We don't make him out to be anything more than a low-level runner.
That's about right.
Do you know any of his associates?
How's the charter business going?
It's how I'm making the big bucks.
How's everything else going?
I wanna talk to you about Diana real quick.
- Shit. ls everything okay?
- She was upset about the other night.
You take one fucking night off, she gets a bug in her ass about it?
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
- Do you need help with any of this stuff?
- Yeah.
I love you, brother.
Fuck.
You just eat awfully fast for someone who enjoys food as much as you do.
You know, I like the way you prepare this better.
Expand it how?
Honey, didn't your father say no to that idea years ago?
Just thought...now you have a say, you might look at it differently.
I've always had a say.
Will you think about it?
I've already let you change the menu.
No more business talk tonight, okay?
I'm having dinner with my son.
- Today.
- You got it.
No problem.
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?
Biology class?
I'm filleting.
- You know anything about cooking?
- I suck at cooking.
Didn't you go to cooking school?
I tried making a pie once, actually, and it kind of tasted like a brick.
Intuition.
But you do have to have some technique.
Well, that's someone being fucking lazy in preparation.
Let me show you how this is done.
With the mahi, you fucking peel this off, just like a banana.
Look at that.
And that's what we're left with.
- Bridal magazines?
You can't wait five minutes before you start planning this thing?
Someone left this in Bungalow 4, and I'm just looking at it.
They did not.
Will you please just let me enjoy this?
It'll be fun, honey.
Your father would be so happy.
Well, I'm having fun.
I actually like it.
And Danny could do the menu.
- Maybe.
- He's showing interest in that again.
I saw in the invoices that the food deliveries are up.
Why are we making changes?
Why not?
I'm not even sure that it works financially.
Sure.
Danny's a big part of the future here.
And I value his opinion.
Of course.
There's a bone in here.
Put it to the side.
Danny taught me how to fillet a fish.
When was that?
Earlier when I went over to see Mama Ray.
Gotta go.
Maybe just once that kid can come to the front door and knock instead of honking that damn horn.
No one does that anymore.
Honey.
- What's with the attitude?
She's hanging out with Danny?
We talked about this.
I'm not comfortable with it.
Whatever happened with that cooking school?
It's good wine.
The fish was very good tonight.
This one's got dead leaves on it.
- Don't worry about it.
- John and I were very drunk.
It's fine.
I will.
Not a good idea.
Is it just you?
It was five a little while ago.
How was your day?
To apologize.
That's a good thing.
Not the way he does it.
And I called the cooking school.
He went for half a semester and then left.
So I don't know what the fuck we paid for.
You called.
It was two years ago.
Don't you wanna know what he's been doing since then?
I brought a special shipment for you today.
Only the best.
Danny, you fucking idiot.
Who the fuck is Beth Mackey?
You been talking to Mom?
Do you have a problem with my plans?
Well, she asked me to weigh in.
Maybe I haven't been clear, because I don't need you weighing in.
I hardly think I'm the person putting ideas in her head.
Maybe before you change things, you should be here longer than a few weeks.
I have an opinion.
Look at me.
- It's my future too.
When you went to law school, Morn and Dad paid for it, right?
When I went to cooking school, who fucking paid for it?
I had to fucking put my hand out and fucking beg people.
I turned down opportunities so that I could help Mom and Dad.
Because you're such a good daughter, right?
You're such a fucking liar.
Please leave.
I have a lot of work to do.
Rayburn!
- You don't know shit.
- I'm filing a restraining order.
I'm filing a restraining order against you.
Hey, next time you wanna come after me, have the balls to do it yourself, you fucking asshole.
Fuck.
I was looking to talk to someone about the restaurant.
Oh, the place has been empty for months now.
- Do you know what happened?
- I heard something about a kitchen fire.
You recognize him?
Oh, shit.
I mean, you know, I think he was the head chef?
- Does tomorrow morning work?
Sarah.
- That's it?
- He did not kill her.
- Well, he may as well have.
I just felt like there was more to it.
You mean what happened after.
- You really don't remember this?
Yeah, well, that was the story.
He didn't get hit by a car?
Then what happened to him?
Dad did that to him?
Dad came home from the hospital.
They ran through here, chased Danny down to the beach.
We watched it right through that window.
- So we all lied to a police officer?
- I don't call it lying.
Who told us to lie?
- You saw the car hit your brother?
I never saw someone get hurt that bad.
Will you ask Meg to come in?
Are you nervous?
- No.
- Good.
There's no reason to be nervous.
These are simple questions, okay?
I wanna ask about your brother Danny.
You know anything about that?
Then how do you know?
- John.
John Rayburn.
You guys don't look anything alike.
Oh, we take after different sides of the family.
How do I know you're his brother?
How's that?
- Not that I know of.
I was thinking maybe since you called me back, you were concerned about him too.
I'm wondering if maybe I could ask you a few questions, please.
I'd like to know more about my brother.
- Oh, no.
Oh, you have someone with you?
- I'm well, thanks.
- Good to see you.
I can't believe I'm gonna be related to this guy.
- Right?
- Are you keeping secrets from me?
What about my sister?
She got any secrets?
I'm sure she's got a few secrets.
Oh, will you stop picking on your sister?
Might have to do some cop work.
Shine a light.
There they are.
I'll get them, Mama.
Thanks, honey.
So how've you been?
That little fucking game that you're playing outside.
So you're not having fun anymore?
Maybe it's not a game.
Go tell him.
I think it's a perfect time.
What a fucking thrill for you to humiliate me in front of Mom.
Why would I wanna do that?
Or do you want me to do it?
I'm not gonna live in fear of you.
Does this mean that I'm not gonna be doing the catering for the wedding?
I know you bailed him out of jail, but how did he end up in jail?
He owed a lot of money.
Do you know who he owed the money to?
The kind of guys that get it back, or you get hurt.
- So you know about the restaurant.
- That's what he borrowed the money for.
I understand there was a fire.
Danny said someone torched the place.
Did he say who?
Your brother didn't get any of the insurance money, if that's what you think.
Then he got weird.
Speaking to people who weren't there.
When I walked in, he was alone.
When's the last time you talked to Danny?
Couple months ago maybe.
Their money.
They keep coming by, asking for him.
- Until recently.
- Maybe he paid them back.
I seriously doubt that.
You know, if you see him, would you tell him that...
Whatever.
I still drive by his apartment sometimes, wondering if he's gonna turn up.
What apartment?
This is your brother's place here.
I haven't seen the guy in weeks.
Look, I don't want any trouble, detective.
It's beautiful.
Are you gonna finish rolling that joint or should I?
Busted.
I haven't done this since I was a kid.
Your father did not approve.
I was fun once.
Even a little wild.
Back in high school, every weekend my girlfriends and I would hang out near the Navy base.
We were about 17, so we had to take turns finding a sailor to buy us liquor.
I thought Aunt Charlotte introduced you.
That's the story that your father liked to tell.
I'd sneak out of the house, me and my girlfriends, and we'd hitchhike all the way to the east side of town to this bar called Ruby's.
Must have been my turn to find a sailor.
I remember looking around the room and there he was.
In uniform.
Those killer blue eyes.
And very, very persuasive.
We spent the night together in the back of his pickup.
Behind a parking lot.
Just like that?
- Weren't you worried?
That's what you do.
What do you mean?
Hello, officer.
Get out of the car.
The handle doesn't work.
What this time?
Spread them.
Let's talk about Danny.
I'm almost at the end of the story now... and then I put my fate in your hands.
I'm a very lucky woman.
I've been given more in this life than I could ever have hoped for.
It's you all that keep me going.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
As for my brother... people say he's a monster.
He did terrible things.
But I fee! sorry for him.
He just got a rough deal.
I wish I knew what happened to him... where he went, how he's doing.
Maybe one day I'll find out.
And I hope he knows I love him.
Let's talk about Danny.
Somehow, he's been making a lot of money.
You two been hanging out?
He's my best fucking friend.
I don't understand why he'd lie about that.
How the fuck should I know?
Maybe because you two have been doing things, bad things, that you shouldn't be doing.
There it is.
That fucking look you've been giving me my whole life.
Hey, you hear that?
That's the sound of fun starting.
Nothing but a few empties, an old boom box and those.
Yeah, they were hidden under a blanket.
Maybe.
Yeah, I mean, it's tough to know for sure if it's O'Bannon.
That's O'Bannon.
You think he knows he's stealing gas for a murderer?
I don't think the fuckwit knows what he's doing.
Who's he run with?
Any guess who that is?
He said, "Stay the fuck away from my son Danny."
You should've listened to him.
Because you are up to your ears in shit, my friend.
You're gonna wanna tell your side of the story before Danny does because I can promise you, this is not gonna end well for the both of you.
You know... it is so fucking sad how little you know your brother.
- Why don't you educate me then?
Last chance.
Come on, go on.
You're free to go.
You keep doing what you're doing, though... and you are fucked.
And so is Danny.
Why don't you tell him that the next time you see him?
Don't you say that to me.
Oh, I know what Fm doing.
Stop it.
I know what I have to do.
So John boy, your brother, pulls me in and he starts asking me these questions, okay?
About what?
Mostly about you.
He knows you're making money.
What'd you tell him?
If he had anything, do you think you'd be standing here?
I've known your brother for how many years?
He fucking is gunning for you.
Nothing.
I'm surprised you don't burst into flames.
Hey, what'd you wear on your big day, Kev?
Well, my mama's got ideas.
You look like a country gentleman.
You're next, Prince Charming.
You look very handsome.
Yeah, I may never take this thing off.
What do you think?
Losing Lowry's local point of entry was a setback, but thanks to Detectives Rayburn and Diaz here, we were able to get a warrant and are now currently up on the cell phone of Mr. Rafi Quintana.
Now, for a guy who's an ex-con working at a local bait shop, he is surprisingly tough to keep eyes on.
Got an uncanny sense of when to ditch phones, addresses and cars.
Gentlemen, the goal of this operation is to determine who Lowry is using to offload his narcotics.
Quintana is Lowry's right-hand, but he couldn't pull this off without a network of people who know the area.
So the Sheriff's Department is providing an assist.
You got any questions about anything local, talk to Rayburn and Diaz.
My wife's worried that he's gonna end up looking like me.
You have kids?
Not sure that I'm cut out to be a father.
Well, you never know.
Might just surprise yourself someday.
Everything working out with the seafood?
In fact, we're looking to run four charters this week.
That gonna be a problem for you?
We can accommodate as many guests as you send our way.
How long has your family run that place?
Near 50 years.
My goodness.
That's half a goddamn century.
Couldn't be prouder.
How long have you known Eric O'Bannon?
I mean, it's not just him, it's everybody, my whole family.
We are not the people that I thought we were.
What do you mean?
What change do you need?
Well, tell me.
Do you ever consider moving to New York?
You're being serious?
You remember that firm that I did the compliance work for?
There's an opening and they want me to come in and interview for it.
I never thought that you'd be interested in the big-firm, 90-hours-a-week shit.
How come you never... brought this up to me before?
I never heard you mention New York.
When'd you get this offer?
A while ago.
And you didn't tell me about it.
There's something else that I wanna tell you.
Before we were engaged, I slept with someone.
I only did it a few times.
Please say something to me.
We're just setting up for dinner service.
So we're definitely expanding.
Yeah, I made an executive decision.
I thought Carlos was temporary.
Yeah, well, he was doing such a great job that Danny suggested we bring him on full time.
Which do you prefer?
Isn't it awesome?
- Get that clip ready, would you?
I'm thinking it's O'Bannon.
You'll hear two men speaking, the first is Quintana.
That was Rafi.
Sure thing, I'M be there.
I'm afraid that's all we got.
Am I right?
ls that O'Bannon?
Play it again for him.
You know that voice?
Hey, Mom, are you decent?
Let me see what you got.
Did you see who's here?
I can't make a sandwich with a can of this.
How are you doing?
- Did you get my scratch-offs?
I won the big prize once.
Eric didn't tell me you were back.
I don't know how well you remember him, but my dad, he- - He died recently.
I heard.
Paper made him out like he was a saint.
He was no saint.
No, he wasn't.
Your mother dead too?
No, she's doing well.
- Still running that hotel?
I never liked her either.
Your prescriptions are on the counter and the food's in the fridge.
Tell the landlord I'm gonna need a little more time, all right?
How much time?
You're not gonna lose the place, all right?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Call me if you need anything.
How you doing?
Did I do something wrong?
You ever think what your life might be like, how different it would be, if that case went to trial?
You know, instead of having a steady paycheck and a cushy job, you'd be locked away in prison.
I just keep wondering why he pulled out at the last minute.
Do you know anything about that?
- I wouldn't know anything about that.
Do you think that my brother might know something about that?
All right, junior Rayburns, you're home, so get the fuck out of the car.
How come Danny drove you home?
He was waiting for us at school and he took us out to get some pizza.
Mom.
Good afternoon, law office.
Hey, it's Meg Rayburn for Susannah Chaffee.
- Can you hold, please?
- Yeah, I can hold.
- How's New York?
Please, don't rub it in.
I was just calling because I was curious if that job offer is still on the table.
Absolutely.
Are you ready to sit down with a couple of partners?
Yeah, I'm definitely interested.
Why can't we see him?
Because we've asked you not to, Janey, that's why.
You haven't explained any of it to us.
You can't tell us not to see him and not give us a reason.
What are you guys afraid of?
Yeah, it's not like we're the ones who went out and got drunk with him.
Listen, you two, you haven't done anything wrong, all right?
No kidding we haven't.
End of conversation, okay?
We're drinking to everything.
The chamber of commerce is asking to reschedule that pier dedication.
Okay, so, what doesn't sit right?
Oh, it-- ls it too soon?
Would it be disrespectful to Robert?
Oh, your father and I used to sit out here like this at the end of every week.
We'd get Meggy to sleep, and that would take about three hours... then we'd sit out here and watch you boys swimming and playing till it was pitch-black dark out.
And Sarah.
Yeah, those were the days though, huh, Mom?
It was just paradise for all of us.
- Hey, man.
You make any headway on this Nicky Widmark thing?
He didn't do this, though, Kevin.
How do you know that?
Look, Kevin, we've known him since second grade.
This isn't his kind of thing.
Okay, so if it wasn't Widmark, who was it?
Look, I think maybe we should consider the possibility that it was a random situation.
What if it's not a random situation?
What if there's somebody out there who wants to fucking hurt me?
That's a shitty thing to say to me.
If you've got a lead, if you know somebody you want me to talk to, I can pursue that.
If I think of someone?
What's going on?
What is this nonsense about you telling Ben and Janey to stay away from their uncle?
He's involved in something where he's gonna get into a lot of trouble.
Oh, did you catch him smoking grass?
Because, you know, he smoked some with me.
That's not the issue, Sally.
What are you accusing him of?
There's a lot of moving pieces.
And so do you.
This goddamn family is gonna have to stop treating him like an outcast.
Don't make me choose sides, John, because I will.
Sorry I'm late.
Patient had a seizure 10 minutes before my shift ended.
So seeing your mom really brought back memories.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
She told me you stopped by.
I thought I could help out with the rent.
Rent, and then some.
Look, it's really generous, but she's not your responsibility.
Is she yours?
Because I remember growing up, she was horrible to you two.
Yeah, no argument there.
Then why are you doing it?
I mean, look at her.
Does my mother look happy to you?
She had a shitty life and she's miserable.
Exactly.
So, what's that got to do with you?
She tried.
Which is why I can't accept this.
- Where'd you get all that loot, anyway?
- Just working at the inn.
No way.
Well, my dad left me some money.
What road?
I can't be with you if you're heading for trouble.
No, you don't have to worry about that.
Our contact tells us Lowry's next shipment is headed here in the next 48 hours.
Know where they're touching down?
No, but we're fairly certain Quintana will lay hands on it.
Apparently, Lowry uses him to move his product up north.
Sand-fuck of it is, we don't have enough intel.
Our orders are to let Quintana make the pickup and stop him in transit.
Then we'll use him to take down everyone else.
The DEA is gonna bring some guy in... and they're gonna flip him.
Danny's gonna get caught up in it.
When's that gonna happen?
Couple days.
How are you doing with all of this?
I'm fine.
I just want him out of my life.
I was thinking about your mom.
You should tell her.
Sorry to hear what happened to you at the boatyard.
How long have you guys been...?
But you already knew that, right?
Do you know that sometimes I ask her to call me Kevin?
It makes me so fucking hard that you and I finally have something in common.
Mom.
Hey, honey.
Oh, it's always about Danny.
Sit down.
I don't know what you remember from around the time that we lost Sarah.
A little bit.
Your father and I were having a rough go.
Raising five children, running this place.
We weren't getting along.
It was a struggle.
Seems crazy now, but at the time it seemed like I had no other choice.
No other choice about what?
About leaving.
I left your father, John.
Oh, Sarah must've heard us fighting on the phone.
I didn't hold her, I didn't try to comfort her.
I told Danny to take her.
And I left.
Then he took her out in the boat... and his whole life fell apart.
Because of me.
Despite everything, he may have found some joy in his life.
I'm holding my breath.
For the first time in his life, I think maybe he's gonna be okay.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck you.
Nana's cooking lessons paid off.
They sure did.
How long was it Diana and I paid those tuition rates?
Two, three years?
Hey, you want your money back, I'll write you a check in the morning.
You got some extra cash laying around?
Wasn't too long ago you were bitching about your paycheck.
Well...when your mom is the boss, you do okay.
Except you're not just working with Mom, are you?
Can't say I know those names, John.
Listen to rne, asshole.
You get one fucking shot at this.
I know something's going down, whether you know about it or you don't.
When it happens, Wayne Lowry's going down with it.
I can see you're very worked up--
You see them?
After that, you're on your own.
You know, you keep doing right, and there'll be more in this for you.
More is good.
Si, hermano, more is more fucking good.
What else you guys got going on?
What else?
Got a good setup.
Seems a shame not to use it for other things.
Like what?
Not anymore.
Why not?
Had some trouble in the past.
There's no sign of anyone.
You take the cargo, then I'll dump the boat.
Get rid of them.
We don't have to.
Get rid of them.
Understood?
It was a fucking shit storm, bro.
So You stopped?
Bridal gowns.
I thought we could start looking in Miami this weekend and make a day out of it.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Look, I know you're busy, but did you have a chance to file those new ownership documents?
No, I didn't.
What are you talking about?
I know you're happy with what he's doing here, and I'm willing to give him a chance, but it's too soon.
I just don't understand why you're doing this.
Boss, Quintana's cell is back up.
Hey, locked and loaded.
Well, good luck to you.
Sounds like confirmation.
Quintana made the pickup.
Call came from a gas station on Palm Avenue and Highway 1.
All right, Unit 3, head north, get eyes on him.
I'm ready to talk.
Command to all units.
I'll try and cut a deal, but I've gotta know everything.
I understand.
Command, this is Unit 3.
We can set up just north across quay.
All available units, prepare to block the road.
Eric O'Bannon had a job going, so he cut me in on it.
And we went out and we stole the gas and...
What'd you do with the gas?
We took it out to the mangroves.
I had no idea at the time why we were doing that, what we were doing.
- Do you know who it was for?
Unit 1 and 2, stop and close off H1 from the rear.
Let's do this.
Driver, put your car in park, open the window, and slowly put your hands outside where we can see them.
NOW!
How did you hook up with Rafi Quintana?
Well, Rafi paid Eric, Eric paid me, so I followed Rafi to the bait and tackle shop.
So you went to Lowry, Lowry didn't go to you.
Yeah, it was all me.
What was the proposition?
I'd like to know.
Excuse me a minute, will you?
Tell Rayburn I owe him one.
The load is safe?
We'll lay low for a while and wait till you get back.
How long you thinking?
Are you sure?
Clay, I thought you were tracking his cell phone.
We were.
Found the fucking thing stuffed in his goddamn glove box.
These assholes must have known we were onto them.
Shouldn't take us more than a couple of hours to get to the Bahamas.
Nice.
Paulo will meet you two in Nassau.
He'll get you spending money, set you up, make sure you're comfortable.
Thanks, boss.
Bad news?
No, not really.
What was the proposition?
No, I don't think I'm gonna tell you any more.
- And why is that?
- I don't think I have to.
I don't think you're gonna catch Quintana... and flip him.
That was the plan, right?
Real smart.
Knocking out a federal fucking takedown.
Did you feel really smart when you were tipping me off?
It's a matter of time, we bring Quintana in.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
You really think you're in the fucking clear?
What are you gonna do?
Arrest me for stealing gas?
I'll be out in a month.
I've got your voice on a federal fucking wiretap.
John, you don't know everything.
You take me down... you're gonna take down the whole family.
I'll call the shots now.
We'll see about that.
Danny, don't.
For good.
So you wait for a call from me.
Listen, I have a question for you.
Did you ever talk to my brother about you and me'?
What did he say?
Did he seem, you know, pissed off or...'?
- And what?
- I still don't know who attacked me.
Can I just ask you one more thing?
What is it exactly you see in him?
Sorry to bug you.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I'm out of here.
Leave him alone.
Glad to see you're making your meetings.
Yeah, you know, just keeping clean.
Why don't you get in the car?
Nothing.
You know what I think, Carlos?
I think that you are a lying sack of shit.
I talked to my sister.
You've been hanging out with Danny.
You know what you're gonna do?
You're gonna tell me everything.
Wonderful.
Have you got it?
You fucking sure you want it?
Yeah, this fucking guy who came to see me, man.
Rafi's not fucking coming back from the Bahamas, is he?
Yeah, I don't think so.
This is really fucked up.
Oh, fuck, what did I get myself into now?
You know, we had a nice fucking easy money-maker.
This is on your head as much as it is on mine.
I didn't offer you fucking doing this.
Eric, I may need you.
Of course.
I don't know where this will end.
Why are the lights off?
Is there something on your mind?
I was wondering how long it'd take you to blame me.
Chelsea, Danny.
Why would I be mad about that?
Because you apologized.
As long as you apologize, it makes everything all right.
As long as you say you're sorry.
Then again, I've been saying sorry my whole life.
Never seemed to make any fucking difference to any of you.
I hear you saying all this bullshit, but I don't hear you denying it.
Let's say that I did send Eric after you.
I apologize.
I mean, from the bottom of my heart.
Good night, Kevin.
Danny made me do it, man.
Sit down right there.
Sit your ass on the ground, right now.
Listen to me very closely, all right?
Do you understand that?
Yes, sir.
Call Kevin and meet me at the boatyard.
You were right about Danny and Carlos.
I saw it.
Why is he doing this?
- Because I checked into it.
- When were you gonna tell us?
- ls that really the point'?
Even talking about it is dangerous.
Every second we don't report it to police, we're breaking the law.
Meg's right.
If we're gonna get ahead of this, we need to report it.
- I talk to the DEA.
The inn's gonna be shut down for God knows how long.
The business will never recover.
- We didn't fucking do anything.
There's no way to keep it out of the news.
Mom is gonna be devastated.
Everything Mom and Dad ever worked for their whole lives is gonna be gone.
Yeah, we do.
If there's nothing in that shed, then we have nothing to worry about.
If we move anything in that shed... we are felons.
We are dealers at that point.
I go to the DEA.
I can try to manage the situation.
You can try, but we won't come out clean.
What's up?
So the narcotics are on your property?
My sister hadn't found that shit, I wouldn't have believed any of this.
The old route is burnt, so you're gonna bring everything you got to me.
At mile marker 101 heading north, there's a turnoff to a warehouse.
What's he doing?
Preparing a charter.
You know I gotta ask you this.
- A tip-off?
You spoken to him since you discovered this?
I came straight to you, Clay.
You understand what it means if we find this on your family's property?
I'm coming to you, Clay.
I'm telling you what I found as soon as I found it.
It won't matter.
I'll get a team together.
Let's go get your brother.
I can't.
What do you mean?
He told me and Ben we're not supposed to see you.
Brothers.
Can I have a cigarette?
What'd you do to him?
Your dad?
It's a very good question.
Maybe someday he'll realize that.
Scary Uncle Danny.
Danny, don't.
Thanks for the cigarette.
Oh, look who it is.
DEA has some questions for you.
Like, ask me questions about my brother leaking details of the investigation?
What am I looking at here?
I don't know.
- Right now, Meg.
ls that John?
DEA wants to talk to me.
What's going on?
I'm not sure.
How'd you know what it was?
How much was there?
- I didn't do anything--
- I wouldn't say anything right now.
I'll talk to Marco.
Gonna go have a talk with your brother.
Jesus.
Yeah, it just seems like a lot of fuss and bother about nothing, really.
How the hell could you release him, Clay?
Danny must've moved the drugs before you picked him up.
Okay, so what do we do now?
John, I'm sitting here with a fuck-load of illegal shit in my boatyard.
I have no idea how this is supposed to work.
Don't do a goddamn thing until I get there.
Meg, what are we doing?
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.
I wondered what you meant when you said that you were gonna take the family down with you.
Didn't quite turn out that way, though, did it?
Family's in the clear.
DEA didn't find anything in there.
But they're still after you, Danny.
Then I got bigger problems than the DEA.
Wayne Lowry.
Not gonna be very happy, he finds out his shed is empty.
Be smart and get out of town.
Is that what this is all about?
Hey, it's not my problem.
Not your fucking problem.
Right after Sarah died.
That's when you washed your hands of me.
I'm taking you to the bus stop tonight.
Do you know what killed her?
Dropped it in the sea, went in after it.
A little seahorse.
As soon as she put it on, she was already dead.
But you should have.
I was just trying to make her feel better.
You stay here, you take your chance with Lowry.
Either that or you come to the bus station with me.
It's your fucking choice.
Well, that's too bad.
Fuck.
- Then what?
- Then do what you have to.
Maybe I'll see you at Christmas.
We're almost through this.
Think you should think about getting out of there, too.
I don't think it's gonna be safe there.
Would you say goodbye to your sister for me?
Is she going away?
Let's do something fun.
Are you glad you came home?
Things took a turn.
Where are we going?
Back to Miami, then who knows?
Because it's not safe for me here.
Let's do something fun.
You can't take her without an adult.
I... thought that, you know, I could make them understand.
They can't.
But you understand.
They don't see what I see.
It's over with Danny.
He's gone.
What do you really want?
I just want them to feel what I feel.
What happened?
I want them to know what it's like.
- Hey, don't do that.
- I'm on the phone, Janey.
I'm just asking where.
Well, look who it is.
This is a nice surprise.
I heard about what happened.
What's going on in your world?
- How long?
I'm thinking of moving there.
I need a change.
It's all good.
You look great.
Come with us.
Danny, don't.
She needs to be with an adult.
There are things you aren't telling me, John.
We both know whose voice is on that tape, and who's on the video with O'Bannon.
Vicente Cruz lost a daughter, you remember?
But you gotta take the lead.
Where is she anyway?
John's dropping her off so she's bound to be three hours late.
These gowns are awful.
- I fucked up with Marco.
I'll tell you later.
Here you are.
- You're supposed to be picking up Janey.
No, I'm leaving now.
Huff)'-
Why would you think that?
It was a guy in the truck and she said you were coming.
It's your dad.
Well, maybe you should.
He's probably worried about you.
You call me immediately.
It's nice out here.
What a place to grow up, huh?
I guess.
Name is Jane B. Rayburn.
You know where we're headed?
I got a good idea.
You coming in?
Shit.
Marine One, come in.
Should be here in about 30.
Give us the location.
Where's the boat?
- Did anyone see my daughter?
- There was a man, but no girl with him.
Danny, don't.
You shouldn't have been out there with her.
But you should have.
- I'm not sure.
- What the fuck do you want, huh?
I bought her a present, John.
Well, I've got more of them.
If that's not something you're interested in, we can turn back around and never talk about this again.
This is where we come to figure out what we're dealing with.
This is what you saw, isn't it?
Sometimes we see them.
Nick sees them a lot more.
I didn't imagine it.
No.
They're called wesen.
Or do you just want to walk away?
I'm not going anywhere.
Mom, it's my honeymoon.
I'll call you when I call you, and I'll text you when I text you.
Okay, love you too, bye.
Officer Acker.
I'm gonna love watching you die.
The Aswang's real too.
How do I know you're not lying to me now?
Some of my closest friends are wesen.
Oh, so there are friendly ones too... good to know.
We're on our way.
- What happened?
I thought I saw something, got outside to look, was hit from behind.
We've got somebody talking to neighbors to see if anybody saw anything.
We need to find him before they hurt him.
But right now I need you to calm down and answer a few questions, okay?
I will call you as soon as we find out anything.
I really, really need to talk to you.
Why'd you get out of your car?
I know I screwed this up, you guys, I'm sorry.
Why'd he wait to call it in?
Thanks for bringing her over.
I'm so scared.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I already told your Grimm friend I got no beef with you.
Well, what do you know?
Water.
I need water.
Where am I?
I tell you that and I'm in big trouble.
Let me get you some water.
Don't tell anyone I'm doing this for you.
Dumbass.
You should know that Blutbaden don't lie with Fuchsbau!
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.
What's your name?
I hope not.
Extremely.
You wanted to see me?
I understand you had a talk with Burkhardt and Griffin.
You mean about Theresa?
It's better than being crazy, isn't it?
No, no, of course not.
Anything else?
Are you...
Where's your gleichheit?
It's time.
Good morning, sunshine.
You should've knocked.
You're not going alone.
You wanna tell us about that?
What's that, some kind of beer?
Oh, now you're gonna get tough with me.
You're dead.
I thought you weren't a Grimm no more.
Well, you thought wrong.
There's a more primal law at work here.
Now, you're a Klaustreich, Nick's a Grimm.
Let's put someone on Shaw's house.
Well, then we tell him.
I made up the guest bedroom.
Don't go there.
I feel like I can't breathe.
Monroe told me that for the rest of our lives we'll be known as Monroe and Rosalee, not just Monroe, not just Rosalee, but Monroe and Rosalee.
I can't lose him now.
Uh, something you wanted me to do, sir?
Let's have a talk first.
And since the only cops who know what we're up against are in this room, we're gonna need your help.
We need to know you're okay with that.
'Cause we are.
I will do whatever I can to help find Monroe, but when this is over, I'm gonna need to have a more, you know, in-depth talk about... well, there will be plenty of time for that.
I can't do that, sergeant.
Get in.
What the hell's going on?
He needs to hunt these animals down and kill them before they kill Monroe.
- Is that too much to ask?
I warned you.
Oh, my God.
What have I done?
Juliette.
Did you get any sleep?
I'm gonna go make us something to eat.
So does Dempsey.
Harold Johnson currently works at Donavon tools, at 14th and Northeast Wesler.
Nobody came in or out of the front, so whoever got to him got to him back here.
Somebody didn't like that he talked to us.
This is a wesen killing, right?
Found something!
What do you think he wore this for?
Isn't this officer Acker?
He could've tipped Shaw we were watching his house.
Acker stopped me in the hallway when I was on my way over there.
I need to use the bathroom.
Shut the hell up!
Come on, man, bathroom.
My brother wasn't around, you'd be dead by now.
Guy in charge your brother?
In here, I'm the master.
Try anything and I will cut you into little pieces, and mail you to your bitch Fuchsbau.
Get up!
I got a 1:45 A.M. call to Shaw's house from Acker.
You son of a bitch!
What are you gonna do, Jonah?
The tribunal decides his fate, not you.
You upset my little brother.
You filth.
You have no respect for your heritage.
Did Nick call?
No, nothing yet.
If he's trying to get home, I need to be there.
We think somebody on this list knew somebody who was at your wedding, and that person might be the connection to the Wesenrein.
Wesenrein?
What are you talking about?
You didn't know Acker was a police officer?
- He's a cop?
I mean, I've heard of 'em, but... the Wesenrein kidnapped a friend of ours.
We know Acker was involved, which means now you are involved.
He would've killed me if I didn't do what he asked.
Wesenrein.
I'm Peggy Carter.
During the war, I fought side-by-side with Captain America.
As of this moment, Howard Stark is a fugitive from justice.
I found the man who stole Howard's inventions.
He was part of a bigger conspiracy.
Leviathan is coming.
Clearly, you don't know the rules of the house.
Is this not apartment 3-F?
Have a nice night.
He came and went without so much as a peep.
This is it... 424.
All right, welcome to amateur hour.
I got cash, passports.
I didn't exactly get dragged out.
You got a guy, Peggy?
I'm afraid I'm married to my work at the moment.
In 1925, the great Harry Houdini performed at this very building.
Miss Fry... please.
I hope you had a splendid evening, because it will be your last at the Griffith.
Let her be an example for the rest of you.
This institution is not unlike Fort Knox or Alcatraz.
Whether by force or trickery, this building is impenetrable.
Ladies and gentlemen, our pal Leet Brannis.
Turns out, they were wiped out in '44 in the battle of Finow, Germany.
Where we at with your guy?
We're still pulling what's left of him from the truck wreckage, we were able to lift some prints from the passports that I found.
They think it's some kind of long-range transmitter.
Boss, Stark was on the lam when Roxxon went down.
Do we really think he would risk his freedom to blow it up?
Anna, darling, I'm going to take you up on that offer.
In polite society, one telephones ahead before trespassing.
I imagine strange women traipsing through the property isn't a completely unusual occurrence.
Our thief didn't exactly walk the items out of the front door.
I'm afraid the sultry combination of candlelight and rain always puts me out like a baby.
Unbelievable.
A known fugitive isn't answering his door.
If there's nothing further...
That bumper was found in a major crime scene.
Mr. Stark doesn't like visitors, whether he's here to receive them or not.
Well, this will be novel.
Yauch, what about you?
Told my gal I'd take her to a show.
Work day starts at 9:00 A.M., honey.
We really appreciate you coming down here to talk with us, Mr. Jarvis.
You know this guy?
Only from the file.
Do you think he was really involved in the Roxxon implosion?
Well, maybe he didn't blow the place up, but he's capable of driving a getaway car.
Cars, bombs, death rays.
Actually, the death ray's accounted for.
We have reliable information that says that both of these men were in possession of some of your boss' misdoings, and now they're dead.
Oh, what a pity.
Sounds like you found our thieves.
Unless, of course, they were working for your boss.
If we don't play this just right, he'll have a dozen lawyers down here by lunch.
What about the stolen-car report?
Currently lost in the system.
But if the car was actually stolen, we got nothing to use on him.
Eh, we got something that'll rattle this limey's cage good.
Mr. Stark's on the run.
He is also... an innocent man.
I can see why he hired you.
You're smart, cool-headed, extremely loyal, which is surprising, considering you were charged with treason.
But seeing as whatever you did's been swept under a rug, I'm guessing it's a big green one made of Stark money, hmm?
So you dodged the treason conviction.
But you couldn't get out of the dishonorable discharge.
Well, I guess money can't buy everything.
"Honey, pack a bag.
You leave my wife out of this.
You dragged her into it when you broke the law with your boss.
He knows.
Hey, it's just getting good.
I should get back to my station.
All right, I'll let you take my shift.
It's a one-time offer, Carter.
Thank you.
Think about it.
That's my cue.
What do you think?
I think he's on the verge of telling you what Stark had for breakfast two months ago.
Mr. Jarvis, I want you to meet...
Well, thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen.
Now, what do you have to say to him?
Agent Thompson, I apologize.
Agent Carter, sorry doesn't even begin to cover it.
I got a bottle of Schnapps and half a rhubarb pie.
Nice to meet you.
No, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Typically, I find dancers too carefree and irresponsible, though I have always appreciated the discipline of ballet.
Nice to meet you, Dot.
Let's get on with it.
Mr. Stark believed the intruder had some advanced technological assistance.
Mr. Stark believes brushing your teeth requires advanced technological assistance.
Shall we?
You've done this before.
Himalayas before the war.
You said it rained the night of the break-in.
When the tunnels are full, the tide gate opens and the water runs into the river.
All Mr. Brannis would have needed is a raft and a forecast.
He could have floated his stolen treasure all the way to the sea.
You got a hit on my passports?
Congrats, Sousa.
You know, the passports were a gift from me.
Least you could do is cover my shift, you rat bastard.
She acted like I was waving a sock in front of her face.
Don't you have enough women in your life to worry about?
All right, I'm gonna give you a ckel's worth of free advice, pal.
Give it up.
No girl's gonna trade in a red, white, and blue shield for an aluminum crutch.
Your knowledge of waste removal rather surprises me.
I spent a week down here in the winter of '42.
It was... another time, perhaps.
If we're going to be working together, risking our lives together, then I must be able to trust you.
On my honor, you can.
Your honor is not enough.
Would it satisfy you to know that the charge of treason was dropped almost immediately?
It's a start.
We were in Budapest when I met Anna.
And then the war broke out, and things became... difficult.
She was Jewish.
Still is, I'm happy to say.
The general carried several letters of transit in his safe, any one of which would have ensured her safety, but he refused to sign.
You forged his name.
Hence the dishonorable discharge.
How did Anna get out?
The same way I avoided the noose.
Howard?
Mr. Stark had unfinished business with the general, and he and I had always got along.
When he heard of my predicament, he... used his influence.
Sounds like a story.
Another time, perhaps.
Anna obviously knows what Howard did for you, but she doesn't know what you do for him?
Not recently, no.
I may not always be truthful with Anna, but I am always honest.
Difficult balance, that.
Mr. Brannis couldn't have gone very far with a whole raft full of volatile technology.
Not far at all.
Mr. Brannis' symbol.
Well, she looks to have seen better days.
Do you have another one of those?
I remember you.
Nasty little bugger.
What does he do?
Agent Carter, how did you come to discover the stolen items?
Leet Brannis, uh, told me where they were.
And how did you come into contact with Mr. Brannis?
I have been conducting my own private investigation with Howard Stark.
Are you collaborating with Stark, a known traitor and fugitive from justice?
But they won't.
If you wish to clear Mr. Stark's name, you must do so from the shadows.
There's a phone box across the street.
Call it in.
But for God's sake, don't let Krzeminski get hold of it.
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Jarvis, they know your voice now.
Sousa.
Hey, Mack, I, uh, got a hot tip for ya.
Just a pal.
Have a lovely night.
Who was that?
Anonymous tip.
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
And I'm not afraid to kill a woman.
What did you do?
You sure somebody's not yanking your chain?
There it is.
Don't think he can.
This is it.
We got the Stark stuff.
I'm gonna call chief.
I want every single box checked and signed in.
Careful with that, boys.
Hey, keep it sealed off!
Jerome Zandow.
He had an act in a sideshow at Coney Island.
Petty crimes here and there.
He had his hands on an arsenal of Stark Technology, but he just sat there with it.
What's he waiting for?
I'll wake up the eggheads, start figuring out what the hell this stuff is.
And, boys, drive carefully.
I don't want to be the one who sunk Manhattan.
I don't envy you, buddy.
My pal Jack... he's got a special gift for interrogations.
He's real convincing, gets guys to spill their guts.
- The one on the boat...
English broad, solid right hook.
English?
Ohh, damn it!
Don't move.
W-watch where you're going.
Really puts you back there, doesn't it?
Somebody buys it, you realize could happen anytime, any day.
How did it happen?
A concerned citizen?
It's not like we're in the phonebook.
Somebody targeted them, and I'm gonna find that bastard.
I want action plans on my desk in one hour.
Now I got to go call Krzeminski's wife.
I'll call his girlfriend.
The usual?
Yes, please.
Yeah, that would be a nice change.
I got plenty of time on my hands.
All ears.
Uh, it's just that... one of my co-workers died today.
Yes, it was sudden.
We weren't close.
Let me get this jerk his refill, and I'll clock out.
I think that jerk quite fancies you.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
Then an accident made me the impossible.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me.
If you love me, you'll tell me what is going on with you.
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.
15 years ago, Harrison and I were thick as thieves.
- My name is Eobard Thawne.
In the year 2020, you and your wife successfully launched a particle accelerator that changed the course of history.
I'm getting faster, faster than I've ever been, and I wonder if it's because lately something's chasing me.
I know what it is that's stalking me.
- From Coast City?
I'm not hungry.
You of all people can understand how grief can change a person.
Caitlin, we believe that Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash and killed Barry's mother, and he may have done the same thing to Tess Morgan.
Oh, um, can you cover for me with Dr. Wells?
You mean lie?
What do you want us to do here?
- See you tomorrow.
So let's go over this again.
This is you on the surveillance footage, correct?
Have you, um, seen my dad?
Like father, like daughter I guess.
I'm sorry.
When are you coming home?
When it starts to feel like a home again.
I recently inherited the entire collection.
There's nothing to talk about.
The truth?
You can't outrun me.
I won't have to.
Well, that was new.
A shape-shifter?
Yeah, I literally saw a grown man, like, m... morph into a teenage girl.
Because at this point we don't know if the shape-shifter is capable of absorbing more that just your physical characteristics.
And the first one was?
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.
Always here to help, Barry.
There it is.
So, uh... what are you two hoping to find?
Just following a hunch.
Still, we'd appreciate a look.
Whatever you need.
Captain, I need those witness statements for the Joshua Brown trial.
Um, yeah, well, like I told you, end of day.
Sorry, uh, Detective West, Cisco Ramon, this is A.D.A. Laurel Lance.
Related?
Can I talk to you privately for a minute?
So, uh... how is Allen?
Cisco, I know Barry's The Flash, and Oliver's The Arrow.
How do you know that?
Because I'm the Black Canary.
You stop it right now.
I love you.
I mean, I love the way that you beat up criminals.
Wait.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I need some technical expertise.
Great.
What... are you spying on me now?
Caitlin, what were you doing at Wells's house?
What are you talking about "your life?"
Those nine months that you were in a coma were the worst of my life.
I lost my reputation, my fiance, and through all of that, Harrison Wells stood by my side.
He told me everything was going to be okay.
If not for me, just do it for him.
I can't believe you're pulling the dad card.
Please.
Turns out Hannibal Bates hasn't been seen in well over a year.
Only remaining relative is his grandmother.
She took out a missing person's report a couple of days after the Jacob Fisher arrest.
Figure we could ask her a few questions.
Why do you ask?
Um... because you filed a missing person's report over a year ago.
Oh, yes, I certainly did.
Uh, neither apparently are my manners.
Ma'am, would you happen to have a recent photograph of Hannibal?
Ma'am?
She's gone.
I'll take the front.
Run like a normal person.
What do you want us to do, Thawne?
Die.
Barry, call 911.
I know what this looks like, Cecile.
It looks like one of your detectives shot two of your cops, both of whom are now fighting for their lives.
We both know there are things going on in this city that can't be explained.
Do you have any way to explain this, Allen?
This is definitely the place.
Cisco, let's see what we can find.
Where'd you find this kid?
It's a long story.
So, it must be interesting having a daughter who is also the D.A.
Smart guy.
We don't always see eye to eye, but no matter how mad she gets at me or how mad I get at her, there's a strong bond.
Yeah, she, uh... she kept something from me, you know, something important.
You sure?
Pretty sure, yeah.
I didn't shoot those officers.
Yeah, the Captain certainly plead your case.
Hell, you're The Flash.
Get me out of here the right way.
I swear I'm going to get Eddie out of this, okay?
I'll call you later, all right?
I have no idea who she is.
Barry, it's me.
Hello... you.
I think I figured out a way to stop our shapeshifter from morphing into other people.
You can do that?
- Yeah, I think so.
Wait, hold up, Cisco.
Okay, see, I thought it was a foot, but a hand is just as bad.
That is freaky.
That is proof, Cisco.
Okay, I'm gonna have to call this one in.
I can't let you do that.
- Listen, Lance, if this is who I think it is, anybody that knows about this is in a hell of a lot of danger, including my daughter.
As mad as you are at Laurel, I can't imagine you wouldn't do anything to protect her.
So this, uh... serum that you're making, is it a temporary fix, or will it take away his power permanently?
Not long.
We just need...
Something I think I should have done... a long time ago.
Oh, my God.
I went through CCPN's crime archives, and in the last 11 months, there have been six crimes committed by people who later swore that they were innocent.
Look again.
Your observations about the shooter were spot on, Miss West.
Our Barry... is right-handed.
Oh, I knew it.
It is indeed.
I need to take him in to the police.
If they can see what he can do, then maybe they'll let Eddie go.
Of course.
Well, at least let me help you.
There is a reporter at work who kept a file of these sorts of things.
You know, all of the unexplained events in the city.
I thought he was just some urban legend.
I think so, yeah.
- Uh, yes, I know.
Listen, I should be thanking you for getting me out of the office for a day.
I can think of something that might make things better.
Were you able to make that item?
I think this will do the trick.
You should be able to do some serious damage with this thing.
I think you should call it "The Canary Cry."
I like it.
Hey, you show this to anyone, I'll kill you.
Um... no need for a hug or anything like that.
Payback time.
Guys, are we sure he's at the airport?
According to the GPS on your phone, he's there.
Yeah, but... he could be any of these people.
Gotcha.
Hannibal Bates.
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
Well, look at that.
I'm The Flash.
You may look like me... but you're not as fast.
You're done imitating innocent people.
The one and only.
Detective Thawne has been released.
I have to admit this is new territory for me.
This is new territory for all of us.
I certainly don't think the law is prepared to deal with this kind of criminal.
Hopefully we can catch up fast.
It's hard to believe we live in a world where this kind of impossible even exists.
Luckily it's also a world where The Flash exists.
Uh, speaking of... he left this list of all the robberies that Hannibal Bates was involved in.
Oh, thank God.
You were right.
I was hiding something from you, and you deserve to know the truth.
Let me out of here!
Seen a lot of things that you can become, but who are you, Hannibal Bates?
I can't remember.
What about Dr. Wells?
This isn't possible.
This body is the real Harrison Wells.
If this is Dr. Wells, then who have we been working for this whole time?
It's because he is a different person.
Iris's mother, you never talk about her, do you?
One who's membership is too expensive.
What are you doing?
What is that?
That shouldn't be there.
I'm picking up more activity around here.
Tachyons.
There.
Oh, my God.
What the frak?
When you got off the boat, what happened?
He dropped me off at the inn and then he left.
- I don't police what he does, like you.
- What's the big deal?
When he gave you this, did he say anything to you?
He said he was sorry he missed my birthday.
And that's it?
So are we done?
Yes, we're done.
Have them pack some clothes.
Take them out of town for a while.
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.
You say you knew Danny from high school?
He was a few years ahead of me.
I'm in town visiting family, and I heard Danny was back home.
- Good for him.
Do I know her?
Chelsea O'Bannon?
Yes, she is.
Well, it was nice seeing you, Mrs. Rayburn.
Thanks for coming.
Look, there's some really bad stuff going on with my family.
- I don't know what John's told you.
- He's worried about Danny.
Anyway, I don't know that I wanna stay around here that much longer.
And I need to decide about New York.
And I haven't heard back from you.
Well, I thought I made myself perfectly clear.
You didn't really say much.
Because I have nothing to say to you.
Go to New York, Meg.
And live your life however you wanna live it.
Where am I supposed to take them?
You don't know what you're talking about.
You told rne that he was gonna be arrested.
You protected him, didn't you?
And now he's threatening Janey?
I had no idea he would do something like that.
- Arrest him now.
- I can't.
- There are no grounds.
Because, for some reason, you feel this guilt.
- So you always let him back in.
- Please take the kids and go.
This drama between you?
I don't know.
And were you there when your brother got hurt?
Yes, sir.
And what happened?
He was hit by a car.
He was at the hospital with my sister.
You telling me the truth, son?
Because if you're involved in any way, there are some very unpleasant men that may wanna come and ask you some questions.
Or you can just tell me now.
Tell you what?
John says he threw it all in the ocean. ls that true?
Why don't we just call John right now and we'll ask him.
This thing, between John and me... we will work it out eventually.
- That was a threat.
You know exactly what you did.
Hey, you were gonna cut me in on the family business.
Did you ever file that paperwork?
Of course not.
- Is he still there?
- No, he left.
Mile marker 86.
Just call me.
Should be safe here a few days.
Thanks, man.
Paid cash for the room, so...
I'll get you back.
You know I don't give a shit about that, right?
Hope you know what you're doing.
Be safe, bro.
Left you something too.
Mom?
I'm in here.
John, it's late.
I know.
The city keeps calling about that pier dedication, so I just set a date.
It'll be nice for us to go ahead with it.
Have you seen Danny?
When Danny took my daughter out on that boat today, he threatened her.
- Don't talk, just listen to me.
- What are you talking about?
He is a grown man, and he is dangerous.
- Now you're scaring me, John.
- And I am sorry for that, but you've got to hear it.
I've got someone outside to make sure he doesn't step foot on this property.
And if you see him or you hear from him, I need you to call me.
Do you understand that?
Say it.
I'll call you.
Thanks for your help, Frank.
You got it, John.
You made a bad decision coming home.
- You threatened my family.
- I gave Janey a present.
We both know you gotta keep that evidence to get Lowry.
I'm not worried about Lowry, Danny.
Where are you, Danny?
But... he might come after you.
Why don't you and I get together, and we can help each other out.
No, I'm not making any deals with you, Brother.
Shit, Wayne.
Business isn't looking too good, huh?
I want what you owe me.
My brother took it.
It's just-- It's a big brother, little brother--
Where is my shit?
I guess the guy just draws the line at torching immigrants.
I can get your stuff back, Wayne.
When they do, I wanna bring him in.
The guy took his niece out for a boat ride.
- And nothing happened to her, so...
- He threatened her.
You know you need more than that, John.
That's not enough.
It'll be my daughter's word against his.
Janey doesn't understand what he was doing.
He was sending a message.
Danny's a threat to himself and to the family.
So when they bring him in, we're gonna find something that sticks, all right?
Until he breaks the law, there's absolutely nothing we could do.
If the DEA would've found the drugs in the shed, we'd have him.
- We don't have shit, you understand?
- Well, then, be creative.
Yeah, I understand.
I also understand there's a fuck-load of shit you're not telling me.
You want my help?
Then tell me what the fuck is going on.
I have, Marco.
All of it.
Like what really happened to the cocaine.
I've told you everything.
I wish I could help you.
I got a lead on where to find Danny Rayburn.
I already found him.
Son of a bitch showed up at my shop this morning.
I'd say it's time to cut your losses.
That's a big fucking bundle to give up on.
Tell me what to do.
Without saying goodbye?
Well, I'm back now.
What's going on?
You're in trouble, aren't you?
But we probably shouldn't have too much contact in the next little while.
Then why are we talking?
Well, I just gotta figure this shit out with John.
I'm not gonna have to leave anymore.
You really believe that, don't you?
You just need to forget them.
Just for a couple of days.
Please, CeCe.
For real.
I learned a long time ago you can't save people from themselves.
They either figure it out on their own or they don't.
It needs gas.
Looking for your pal Danny.
I don't know any fucking Danny.
- Someone's gonna talk!
Last chance.
Where is he?
Shit.
Fuck.
What's going on, Kev?
John's looking for you.
Yeah, I don't think so.
What about you?
Anything you wanna say to me?
No?
Usually, you can't keep your fucking mouth shut.
Now you look just like the little boy that John and I used to spend so much time ignoring.
Get in the car, Danny.
Get in the fucking car.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Get in.
What are you gonna do?
You know something, Kevin?
If you hated me half as much as you hate yourself, you'd have used it.
Thanks for the ride.
See you.
What the hell happened to you?
Why?
- Have you told Danny this?
Well, he won't answer my calls, and I'm afraid to be near him.
I didn't know who else to tell.
You gotta do something, John.
This guy looking for Danny, if he can't find him, he can't hurt him.
At the Red Reef Motel.
I really think somebody might kill him.
I think you're right.
- I think maybe we should meet.
But first I have to know that my family's gonna be safe.
I need to know... that my family's gonna be safe.
We'll talk about that.
Can you meet tomorrow?
Yeah, I can meet tomorrow.
Where?
You remember that little spot near South Bay?
We used to go there in high school after a big night.
We'd watch the sun come up.
Yeah, I remember.
You gave me my first cigarette.
Copy, Morada 7-5.
Can you check out the smoke at Sunset Cove?
Over.
There's a body.
Caucasian male, 40s.
I'm headed there now.
I'll try to be over in a while.
Evening.
You can go home, Frank.
Have you seen Danny?
He called.
We're gonna meet tomorrow at the station and talk.
Everything will be fine.
Oh, thank God.
Right in here, detective.
Well, I was getting worried.
I'm so glad you came by.
Bullet missed its target.
We found it lodged in the wall.
Gun's over there.
There have clearly been some things going on with this family.
I think it'd be good if we all talked.
You wanna go first?
I'll go first.
It's all true.
I fell in with some bad people.
I needed money, saw an opportunity.
The paycheck you were giving me wasn't gonna cut it, so I started dealing drugs.
So I guess what happened tonight is partly my fault.
What happened tonight?
Oh, God, Danny.
- Business associate.
I don't know what they were gonna do to me, but since I used the inn to bring the drugs through... now you're all in danger.
What do you mean, you used the inn?
Normally I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not, because you're all liars.
- Like it always has been.
- Danny, would you just stop it?
And you are the worst!
I've never felt safe in this house.
And now, none of you are safe in this house.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean, huh, Dan?
You have finally lived up to your father's expectations, Danny.
Son of a bitch.
I thought it was.
- He wants to talk, and I agreed.
- We'll take care of this tonight.
Yeah, he had a gun.
Obviously, somebody got the drop on him.
Maybe they knew he was coming?
Kevin, what's going on?
I'll fix it.
No, I didn't know that.
No, I know you didn't know that.
He's come after me once.
- What the fuck you talking about?
- It was Danny who fucking attacked me.
What are you gonna say?
I'm gonna tell him what he wants to hear.
And it's never enough, John!
It's never fucking enough!
No more fucking talk.
All right, fine, Kevin.
No more fucking talk.
It's untraceable.
Do what you have to.
What's going on?
He hates me.
My baby hates me.
And what happened?
And was your father there?
You telling me the truth, son?
It was your decision not to let me come back here.
Didn't have the guts to tell me, though.
You looked me right in the eye... blamed it on Dad.
Is that what this is about?
It's about much more than that.
How can we work this out?
I don't know, John.
How can we work it out?
I think that you should leave.
Because of all the terrible things I've done?
When we both know... what you did... just last night?
You think Chelsea would go to you first?
Now I know.
Yeah, now.
You just want me to absolve you.
You were right about everything.
No one ever stood up to Dad.
I never did.
I could've made things better for you and I didn't.
I'm sorry.
Because you were never given the chance to have the life I have, and I see that.
But you can't be here.
You expect me to forget about this?
I can forgive so much.
- Not that.
- You can't forgive yourself.
- Because you should have been there.
- You keep saying that.
You had me convinced.
After all these years, I thought, yeah, maybe it could've been me on that boat.
Never.
- No, you keep telling yourself that--
- You know why?
Because she was 10 years old and she shouldn't have been out there.
You did, and that was your choice, so don't blame Sarah's death on me.
- All these years, you all blamed me!
- You were a fuckup before Sarah!
- I don't hate you.
What the fuck do you want?
I want you to know how it feels.
Just to know what it feels like to have to beg, to have to go through your whole life apologizing for everything.
I want you to know-- You want me to leave?
Beg me.
Get down on your knees, and you beg me to go.
Beg me!
When is this gonna end?
What the fuck does that mean?
I told you.
Your life's not always gonna be so perfect.
So you're not gonna beg me?
Because if you're not gonna beg, we don't have anything to talk about.
When's it gonna end, Danny?
- When's it gonna fucking end, huh?
- Okay, stop.
When's it gonna end, Danny?
When's it gonna fucking...?
Seth Branson escaped.
Why would Mr. Branson do this?
Maybe to get the police distracted looking for the Sheriff instead of looking for him.
Kieran, leave a message.
Kieran, uh, look, I don't know if you know, but Branson escaped, and
We have to find the Sheriff.
I think I can help with that.
Whoever hacked the big screen is sending a live signal through my AV system.
Where the hell are my actual friends?
She's not answering.
_
Let him go, okay?
This is about you and me.
Gotta make sure everybody's watching the horror show.
People wanna see blood, and I'm gonna give it to 'em.
Or will Daisy's heart be broken the way she broke Brandon's?
It's up to you.
But I can promise you one thing, it's gonna be gut-wrenching.
We have to find the Sheriff.
I'm trying, but all my serious gear is back at the shop.
Sorry, guys, nobody leaves.
We need to go to the station now or the Sheriff is going to die.
I'd listen to her.
You can take him down.
Mom, the killer just called.
He said unless I put the pieces together fast he's gonna break Daisy's heart.
No, not if we can find what he wants.
You said that the deputy's body looks staged, right?
When he took Will, he carved a clue onto his back.
There's something in his mouth.
Brandon made it for me.
He used to leave me gifts in the tree behind my house.
Mom... what if that's where Clark is?
Grayson, you are such a tool.
Where did you get that?
Well, now it's mine, so...
Did not expect to see you here.
That makes two of us.
Nice mask.
Big plans later?
It's tempting.
I mean, some psycho wears this to kill our friends, and people treat it like it's a joke.
Emma bailed on me, Jake spied on me and everyone else, well, they're gone, so...
Looks like you're officially my favorite person at this party.
So not exactly a banner day in the Maddox household.
So, uh, what brings you to my pity party?
You know, I kind of like this whole real human thing you got going right now.
Hey, look at us bonding.
Chicks before dicks.
Speaking of dicks...
Jake, I don't remember inviting you to the party.
Mom, I'm so sorry.
I did this.
Mom, the EMT said that there was nothing that you could've done.
The bastard just kept him alive so he could watch me try to save him.
I know.
Just like Will.
Mom, we can't let him win.
No, we can't.
Hey, I'll see you there.
- No, I don't want you to.
I have to go to the station with my mom.
You, too.
First he spies on me, then he shows up with her.
She's literally dumb as toast.
Brooke, it's obvious he has nothing for her except the rise it gets out of you.
Yeah, well, I've been known to make things rise myself.
Hey, Board Shorts!
How would you like to share one of the finest wines out of Bordeaux in the last half-century?
Go do some push-ups.
Aye, aye, captain.
Whatever, bitch.
Um, we have to stay here to help with the search, okay?
I'm gonna, um, go get cleaned up.
So they don't even know that we've been trying to contact them.
That's Brooke's house.
Tell the cops we've got him.
Emma, do you hear me?
Because I'm pretty sure they've got, like, big-ass guns and body armor and SWAT Teams.
Because you're the survivor girl, which makes me the know-it-all sidekick.
Tonight, we change the ending.
So I am sorry for what I said about you and your family.
Full disclosure, I kinda was.
See, I knew it!
I was just trying to figure out who.
And maybe I wanted to see your boobs.
I'm sure you've seen plenty.
Fine.
Have you seen Jake?
Jake, are you in there?
What are you waiting for?
What the...
Board Shorts?
I have officially hit rock bottom.
Who set you up?
I don't know.
Just listen to me, okay?
The night that you came to the theater, I was so, so damn happy to see you.
But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you.
I don't even know who you are.
Yes, you do.
All that stuff that happened before, that has nothing to do with us.
Look, what we had was special.
Brooke, you're special to me.
I wanna believe that, but I don't.
Brooke, why won't you let me in?
Oh, my God!
It's Piper.
I'm gonna throw up.
Come on, let's check the house.
Why didn't you call me back?
Well, I didn't feel much like talking after you accused me of murder.
You wanna put that down now?
No, we don't actually want to.
What are you doing here?
You texted me to meet you.
No, I didn't.
Well, I didn't send this to myself.
To convince you he's trustworthy because he's the one controlling the malware.
Why would I hurt Piper?
Because she found out that you might be the son of Brandon James.
We talked to Cassie James.
I don't know what to believe.
Well, where were you all night?
I drove out to the woods to be alone.
I did a little target practice, I got your text, and I came here.
As for Brandon James, when my dad became my guardian again, there was a lot of paperwork.
You can see it all for yourself, it's at home.
You haven't heard?
I'm so sorry.
My mom tried to save him, but it was too late.
I can't believe this.
And you still think that this psychopath could be me?
Take this and use it if you don't trust me.
Let's go find everybody else.
Bubblegum pop has never sounded so terrifying.
That won't be hard.
Here, take this.
Somebody help me!
I don't know.
Me and Brooke got into a thing in the wine cellar, and then I went and took a walk by the lake and when I came back, nobody was here.
I can't find her anywhere.
Maybe someone just spilled their wine.
Their thick, viscous red wine.
What happened?
There's a land line in the kitchen.
Just cut to the chase, okay?
Can't have one without the other.
Where it ended for Brandon James.
The dock at Wren Lake.
Just you, Emma, or others will die!
Emma, he's here.
No more games.
No more masks.
No, you can't be.
I can.
And you were so easily convinced that it had to be his son that was swinging the knife, but it's 2015, Emma.
Dad got shot, I got tossed, and Emma got the perfect life.
For 20 years, you have let everyone think that my dad was the monster, but you were the monster.
If you wanna hurt someone, hurt me!
I plan on it.
But I have kind of put a lot of thought and time into this, so I'd like to savor the moment a little bit before I slice you open, okay?
But why did you kill my friends?
Although they did help a lot.
After all, what did your BFFs do?
They filmed your first time.
And I have him back there, tied up in my trunk.
Do you wanna know how his story ends?
Branson slits Emma's throat in front of Mom before spilling Mom's guts.
Rookie move.
So then I'm gonna stumble out of the bloodbath and I'm gonna broadcast to the world that the Lakewood Slasher is dead.
She will be!
So now, Mommy dearest, you're gonna get to watch her die.
Please stop.
No, please.
See you there.
I think so.
Well, not literally, 'cause then we wouldn't all fit, but you know what I mean.
Hey, guys, this is Noah Foster, local student and survivor of the Lakewood Slasher murders, guest podcasting the final chapter of Autopsy of a Crime for your former host, the now-deceased criminal mastermind behind the killings, Piper Shaw.
Maybe we'll see this as a second chance to do things differently and make a change for the good.
At the end of the day, we're all just grateful that it's over and that the Lakewood Slasher is dead, but there's still one thing I can't figure out.
Piper Shaw confessed to her crimes in classic villain fashion, but she didn't explain who attacked her and Will Belmont in that abandoned building.
Am I just overthinking it?
Or is there more to come?
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
And you can call me Control.
Clever Samaritan, using a young boy as your avatar.
I will destroy you.
Welcome to the stock exchange.
The suspects are heavily armed men and women in ski masks shot a security guard inside the building, then made off with numerous sensitive surveillance hard drives.
Authorities say both assailants are still at large and should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.
In other news, Wall Street continues to recover from the Flash Crash.
Bye, mom.
_
This kid's AWOL from the tour and then some.
We'll talk again soon.
Okay, Shiffman, what are we looking at?
Threat analysis?
Radicalized Muslims, masters level software engineers.
They plan to crash the power grid and cripple police surveillance, so that they can plant the bombs undetected.
Where he met Massoud Shammar and Tariq al Juhani.
August, 2014, all four men enroll in the engineering program at the University of Michigan, Dearborn.
A series of anonymous wire transfers originating in Dubai and passing through a front company in the Comoros.
All historic landmarks on Belle Isle and downtown.
Yesterday morning, Osman Ahmed posted to an Islamist website that he's going to change the world.
Last night, Yasin Said called his mother and insisted she not visit tomorrow.
Research has targeted them for immediate elimination.
We have a team outside their house now.
All units in place.
On your go, ma'am.
What's our source material on these backpack bombs?
Our targets purchased backpacks, pressure cookers, nails, ball bearings, and digital watches.
Viridian Nine, we're a go.
We have a problem.
Found this on the table.
It belongs to target number four, Yasin Said.
His phone is in the house, but he's not.
It's never done that before.
It's not supposed to do that... ever.
I need to see that hard drive.
The hard drive is not relevant.
You don't ask me why.
You are a guest here with one rule, and that is to make sure this system functions as promised.
I'm afraid that's not possible, and actually, you are the guest here at Samaritan's research terminals.
Mr. Travers... show me the hard drive, or I'll have you arrested.
There, stopped.
The fourth, Yasin Said, remains at large, and Mr. Travers, our Samaritan representative, just shut down Research.
Travers won't let us see it.
These guys in Detroit weaponized a piece of computer code.
You mean like a virus?
I should be allowed to view the material.
You wouldn't understand it anyway, so what's the point?
Who the hell do you think you are, Travers?
Mr. Travers is my eyes and ears inside your operation.
If we want the intelligence back on, we need to let this go.
Turn it back on.
Good talk, guys.
Shiffman, Research will be back online presently.
Send team Crimson Six in to pursue the target.
From what I understand, both suspects, the shooters, were a male and female in ski masks.
It's the secure line to Research.
Our orders originated with Control.
This is Control.
Pleasure to meet you.
It's not mutual.
I know about New York, Agent Grice.
I know you saw Agent Shaw at the Knight Morris storage facility, and I know you let her live.
The hard drive is the priority.
Consider this your reprieve.
We need to do this off the grid.
This must be your dream come true, Grice... investigating someone before we put a bullet in their head.
Yeah, just like the old days.
I've never been happier.
Hate to cut you off, Yasin.
At the risk of repeating myself--
My laptop?
Please be careful, it's fragile.
Hey, our boy's alive.
What's your status, Crimson Six?
_
The laptop melted?
Some kind of a self-destruct mechanism that I've never seen before.
He's flagged these three to Toronto tonight.
You think you can interfere with my operations?
Little paranoid there.
Is there something you're trying to hide?
Will that be all?
Call in my personal security detail.
Mike, what's up?
Do I need to brief the president about this terrorist on the loose?
Who told you that?
If there's a problem in Detroit, the White House has to get out in front of it.
There is a problem in Detroit, and no one is ever gonna hear about it.
Yeah, I hope not, for your sake.
And by "handled," you realize I mean killed, right?
But it's the truth, Mike.
853 threats to national security are dead because of us.
Well, keep up the good work.
Gentlemen?
No offense, I asked for my personal detail, my regular guys.
Ma'am, they were southbound on the beltway 90 minutes ago when their vehicle was t-boned by a Mack truck.
They survived.
Occupants of the truck fled the scene, a man and a woman wearing ski masks.
The same two that were raising hell in New York all morning?
State police are investigating, but ma'am, their phones were stolen.
Your mission may be compromised.
I'm gonna put a team on it and we'll find out who did this.
You men and I are going out into the field.
Go.
Contact the station master and stop that train.
What the hell?
Evasive maneuver!
I hope you liked our rocket.
We were saving it for a special occasion.
Where is Shaw?
Memories.
Where is she?
Shaw's cover identity was burned eight days after one of your ISA operatives, guy named Grice, saw her in the field.
The ISA is working with Samaritan, and Samaritan has Shaw.
It's got nothing to do with me.
According to their vehicle GPS, they've been spending a lot of time outside your house in Georgetown.
His name's Yasin Said.
He's planning to attack a major American city, and he was 60 seconds away from capture before you shot me with that shoulder cannon.
Now, he's loose.
Where is Shaw?
I don't know.
I'm almost glad you said that.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
Well, mostly changed.
Shaw used to work for you till you tried to kill her.
You probably remember she has an Axis II personality disorder, which means technically, she's a sociopath, incapable of caring for others.
But the thing about Shaw is, she does care, enough to save my life.
Such a sweet girl.
She deserves a better mother.
- Nine, right, and you started spending a lot of time in the nurse's office.
All that anger, all that stress.
That's when the high blood pressure started, right?
You grew up motherless... and you suffered for it.
Well... at least Julia has a mother.
Because even a mom who kills people for a living is better than no mom at all.
Over 500 people have died in police custody after being tased.
Especially when the officer did this.
You tell me where Sameen is, or Julia will know what it's like to be you.
Go to hell.
Stop it!
This is not how we do things, Miss Groves.
Pardon their aggression.
They're trying to save the life of a dear friend.
Let me go, and we'll call it even.
Sameen risked everything at the stock exchange, not just to save our lives, but to pull the whole world back from the brink of disaster, all with the knowledge that no one would ever even know her name.
Everybody here, all of us, spend our days saving the lives of people we don't even know.
Each loss is unbearable, but when it's someone you know...
We don't know that, Finch.
The surveillance footage from the stock exchange was unreadable.
Why does everybody keep talking about the stock exchange?
What the hell does any of that have to do with Shaw?
Oh, you don't know.
Samaritan crashed the stock market.
There were armed men in the basement of the exchange, a massive firefight six stories underground.
You're in the dark... and you're being kept there for a reason.
How long until your employers decide to kill you?
So desperate to find Shaw, you're willing to say anything to me.
You're not in control of anything.
Speaking of janitors, here come a few now.
You say that like we weren't expecting them.
Surprise.
If you better understood Samaritan, you would know it employs a private army to do its bidding... that it communicates with them on a private, encrypted phone network.
You would suspect they would employ at least one of them as a spy in your own organization.
You might even assume that spy to be among the agents coming here to save you now, holding his private, encrypted network phone, and you would know that that's exactly why I'm here.
Talk to me, Crimson.
Another thing, the Red Wings suck.
You realize he's not from Detroit.
For now.
I think this is good for me.
You almost done checking email?
There are six ISA operatives on site.
I should be seeing six identical signals, but I'm not, I'm seeing seven.
I'm uploading a worm to that phone.
The worm will scour the phone for any information relating to Sameen, and then 18 seconds later, move on the to next Samaritan phone, and it won't give up until we find what we're looking for.
What's your status, Harold?
I'll be right there, Root.
This is for Shaw.
You're Grice?
Mr. Reese, Root, it's done.
On my way.
Let's get out of here.
Did you really think you could run from me in Canada?
It's funny, but the farther you ran, the easier you were to find.
Why'd you kill my friends?
That's what we do to terrorists.
I'm a PhD candidate in software engineering.
Which makes you a very dangerous man.
The next day, I got a text message, offering jobs to me and my friends from school.
The four of us crowded into one of those office park start-ups.
That's how stealth companies work.
We'd write a piece of code, and we'd pass it on to someone else.
Two days ago, we sent the last piece, ten hours later, everyone was dead.
And I'm sure Tariq, Massoud, and Osman were just harmless extremists who conned their way into the United States on student visas.
No, they were my friends.
Maybe they picked us because that's exactly what you'd expect.
Can you consider for a second the possibility you've been lied to?
No.
Just look at your computer, Mike.
Stock market closed exactly where I said it would.
So did your portfolio.
It didn't have to be that way.
Who the hell are you?
I'd like to see the president.
We'll be in touch.
Target engaged.
I just sent a set of updated GPS coordinates, but I must warn you, our lead is a fragile one.
A phone on Samaritan's network left the stock exchange in a refrigerated truck 15 minutes after we lost Sameen.
What's our final destination?
I've traced the truck to these new coordinates to what looks like a small town upstate.
That could be where the truck is located, or it could be nothing.
I know she's alive, Harold.
Nothing would please me more.
It's normally pretty quiet on this level, but if the Pentagon wants a tour, Pentagon gets a tour.
Has the area been cleaned recently?
I got him.
Hey, Wiley.
Unlike you, Mr. I'm-accepted-to-MIT-early, some of us actually have to attend school to graduate.
I know this may sound like a broken record, but care to reveal your plans post-birth?
I'm just gonna continue my career as the Minister's fallen daughter.
Safe to assume you're still not gonna let me know who the father is?
Ah, letting that out of the bag would make me considerably less mysterious, don't you think?
- Would you hurry up, man?
- I'm going as fast as I can.
Well, feel like you're purposely trying to make me late.
Since when do you care about being on time for school anyway?
You got any other ambitions than to be a small-time drug dealer?
My goal is to one day be a big-time drug dealer.
Yeah, well, money's better than being a plumber's apprentice.
Come on!
You dick!
Everything okay here?
This guy needs to watch where he's going.
Ran right into me.
I said everything okay here?
Just so you know, I really do appreciate this and it's an honor.
I can't believe you signed up for the army.
Are you doing this to piss off Dad?
Dad's spent his whole life being pissed off.
Sure, followed by a lifetime of failed relationships, heavy drinking and PTSD.
I've read what happens to soldiers when they come back from combat.
Chances are I won't even see any action.
That's what all the amputees say.
- Uh, yeah, my mother is.
I can't wait to go.
Should be different than here.
Pretty Lake's not so bad.
- What's this for?
You're welcome.
Dinner's ready.
I already ate.
You do realize your water's about to break, right?
Is everything a joke to you, Wiley?
Did you know that your face gets kind of weird when you try to channel your inner mom?
You're an idiot.
Hello?
Is that your son's car out front?
Who's asking?
He almost hit my brother and me the other day on Highway 23.
He shouldn't be behind the wheel of a car.
Let's make one thing clear.
Chuck has two witnesses that say you clipped his car and then drove away.
Then your son is a liar.
Your father's not that close to the bone that he can't afford it.
Yeah, he is.
There's troubling news coming in from Pretty Lake.
In a population of just over 8,000, there have been 36 confirmed deaths since Monday.
It's all there, man.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Adam, you shouldn't be in here.
Got any theories yet, Uncle Dave?
I'm punching way over my weight class on this one.
Your dad would have been right in his element.
Even as a geneticist he was always drawn to the morbid.
Did you learn anything from the Ministry today?
How'd you know about that?
I've been monitoring your e-mails and phone calls since this thing started.
My nephew, the genius.
Now, they say they're close to figuring this thing out.
What do you think?
I think you're here for the same reason I am.
What are you doing?
You and your conspiracy theories.
They said the same thing about SARS, you know.
If I'm being my usual paranoid self, you win.
Anywhere has to be better than here, and if I'm wrong, we can...
You're overreacting.
What's so funny?
You remind me of your father.
It's been confirmed that the disease is accelerating in Pretty Lake as the death toll mounts to over 300.
We need to pray.
No, we don't, Melissa.
Please, Wiley.
For your salvation.
Surely you must understand the danger you're in if you don't ask for forgiveness.
Eternal damnation is a possibility.
I don't want forgiveness from you or God.
Citizens of Pretty Lake, as you know, the situation is increasingly grave.
We are still no closer to finding a cause for these deaths.
Given the escalating death toll, starting immediately, we are putting Pretty Lake under full quarantine.
Know this is not a decision that was taken lightly.
Full details will be posted on our government's websites.
We have called in experts from around the world and we are doing everything we can to figure this thing out.
Make no mistake, this was an extraordinarily difficult decision, but know our thoughts and our prayers are with you.
How long have you known about this, Mayor?
Attention.
Is there a problem?
I'm just trying to get home to Pretty Lake.
- You're a resident of Pretty Lake?
- What's going on?
Step out of the vehicle, sir.
We got something.
What are you doing in here without protection?
You think it's that serious?
- You find anything yet?
- No, not even a cause of death.
That bile there is the only anomaly.
- Any theories about that?
- Well, viral tests are inconclusive.
There were no indicators that these people were sick until they were dead.
Nah, it's gotta be something we're missing.
Listen, I'm not here to judge, but are you sure you wanna do this?
There's no going back.
You understand the ramifications if you tell anyone who the father is?
Yeah, you've made that pretty clear.
You're not gonna count it?
I know where to find you.
My client will make the final payment after the family receives possession of the baby.
Yeah, you mentioned that already.
Your dad was a good man.
I'm sorry he's gone.
To be honest, I'm surprised you showed up today, with everything going on.
Thought you weren't here to judge.
What's up?
Stay out of my way.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Stay out of my way... amigo.
Amigo?
I ain't your amigo.
You're wasting your time.
I've been talking to some high level officials on the outside.
It just doesn't seem real.
No, hopefully they'll lift the quarantine soon.
I'll go looking for him again tomorrow.
You're probably wasting your time.
He went to the city, so he's most likely outside of the quarantine area by now.
He's probably not coming back.
It's just weird that we haven't heard from him.
How you doin'?
I'm scared.
We're all gonna die, aren't we?
Sure feels like it.
Franny?
Dad's dead.
No one under 22.
Uncle Dave?
You're free to leave.
What's going on here?
Here, you'll need these.
Congratulations, you're an official citizen of the quarantine zone.
They're leaving you people to die before you infect the rest of us.
- How you doing?
In here you can't survive without friends.
Seems like we've got bigger problems to deal with.
We've been told to keep everyone who's still alive locked up.
You're as stupid as you look.
You know the weird thing about whatever this thing is?
From what I can see, no one under 22 years old has died.
I've been deep inside the government computers.
They're talking about keeping us quarantined for as long as it takes.
Years if necessary.
The fence doesn't seem like a temporary solution.
Wiley, we have to leave Pretty Lake.
When they change shifts, there's one section that's left unguarded.
We can cut through it before anyone knows what happened.
I'm a beached whale.
When?
Tonight.
- Where the hell have you been?
No, it also means no one else can come inside.
We have free rein.
Let's go have ourselves some fun.
I was thinking that there has never been a better time to go shopping.
All right.
So, where were you?
You ready?
Been waiting a long time for a taste of the good life.
There's no answer at the police station.
And so we're screwed.
I have trackers on all the cars.
If there's any advantage to being under quarantine... when someone steals your merchandise... there's only so many places they could go.
It's quiet around here.
Are they just gonna leave us here?
Seems that way.
I quit.
You know where he is.
They're heading down Reeves Road.
We should check it out.
Seems like we have a problem.
Hands in the air.
You know who I am?
Mr. Lotts.
So you know I own the dealership you just stole that truck from.
I know you, don't I?
Listen, we figured with everything that was going on here, no one would care.
You figured wrong.
So you two are gonna be a lesson to anyone else who thinks they have a free pass to steal my merchandise.
Take off your clothes.
Uh... excuse me?
Do I look like the kind of man that asks twice?
Dad, you think this is a good idea?
Do not tell me to relax!
When someone was around who actually knew what they were doing.
Bring that bucket over here, Chuck.
What the hell is that?
Lie on the ground, boys.
Stay right where you are.
Sir, put the gun down now.
The law's on my side.
I'm just trying to keep the place civilized.
Punks like this don't deserve due process.
By making an example of them, maybe the next idiot that thinks it's his right to take what's not his will think twice.
What's your solution?
Get in your vehicle, go home.
Okay, we're leaving.
But be warned, you have no idea what pile you've just stepped into.
Mel, please, seriously, you need to get help.
Can't we at least talk about this, Gord?
Besides, I assumed Lotts was dead anyway.
What's the point of turning us in?
How do you even know there's cops still alive in there?
Besides, you might find yourself on the wrong end of things.
How do you figure?
I need your help.
You boys can find your way home.
Trust me, there's nowhere for you to go.
Okay, there's things I can do, but you're gonna have to be tough.
I can't do this.
The baby's just gonna be dead anyway.
No, it won't.
Get out.
Kneel down.
You don't need to do this.
Not so tough now, are you, amigo?
Anything you wanna say before I blow your brains out?
I shoulda killed you when I had the chance.
Drop the gun.
I said drop the gun.
Put it on the ground.
Kick it towards me.
I said, get in the cell.
You're almost there.
- You have to.
You try doing this, you dick!
- She doesn't mean that.
Is it... is it alive?
And it's alive and kicking.
But for how long?
Something doesn't feel right to me about Zinaida.
If, by some wild chance, there is something here, we need to know.
The Centre will want Lisa in there soon.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
I've been thinking, and what I really want this year is to get baptized.
We've never used someone this young before.
Oh, couldn't you just eat her up?
We have a lot of love now, but... there are other kinds of love.
My kids haven't played like this in a long time.
You weren't at the meeting again.
When someone falls like Maurice, hanging on doesn't always help, because then you're gonna fall, too.
Yeah, so I should just let him go?
I think you need a break.
Listen, my mom has this place.
Why not?
See how you do without Maurice, even for a few weeks.
It'll also give him a chance to turn things around.
You could still come back here, drive to work.
You can't live like this, Lisa.
Let me help you out.
I think your defector isn't a defector.
Zinaida Preobrazhenskaya?
I think she just might be a Russian spy.
You're out of your mind.
If I can prove it, we'll arrest her.
Then there's a good chance my government can make a trade.
For Nina.
The FBI will go to bat for her.
Prisoner exchange.
You got something better?
Nothing.
When you land, take a week, be in touch with us next Friday.
I can't do that.
I don't belong to you.
I didn't say that.
So, when you get back, start to make peace with the fundamentalist factions in ISI.
I said 5-- already a lie.
Most of the other division heads said 10.
Next time... say 10, Yousaf.
You look worried.
Martha took me to a foster-care place to look at kids.
They're so little.
Remember when walking without falling on their faces was a big deal?
Remember Henry?
No, she wasn't.
I could almost do it if it keep Martha on track.
Where are you with Kimberly?
I'm seeing her tomorrow night, so I should be in the house soon.
Young.
I have to go make dinner.
But John has the biggest vocabulary.
He's always like, "Albeit." I'm like, "What?"
You know, I still don't know what that means-- "Albeit."
What grown-up even says "Albeit," right?
So, how's Mrs. Beeman?
Oh, hey, this baptism-- I think that's great.
Who's this?
Uh... he's a friend of mine.
What kind of friend?
I should get you back.
Well, when are you gonna be back?
But y-you're not old.
You're young.
Age is just a number.
You like hanging out with me, right?
Yes, I-- I really like you.
But I live in New York, and when I'm down here, I'm busy with work.
What are you doing on the 11th?
Mother-in-law's tongue-- that's what it's called.
It's so strange being here in your house-- y-your mom's house.
The kids are having a harder time.
One foot in front of the other, you know.
Fancy.
Cheers.
This?
Your taste is ridiculous, dad.
Okay, fashion queen, you pick one.
As in called called?
I guess women do that now.
Est women do that.
I-I couldn't talk to Sandra, and I lived with her.
How's Matthew dealing with all this?
He pretty much hates me.
You know what you should do?
H-he's-- he's a complete mystery to me.
All the people I've investigated, arrested, but, man, there's nothing like a teenage boy.
Right, but when he was a kid...
You know, I went away undercover for three years.
You should bring your EST lady here for dinner.
What I have to work with is a hormonal 15-year-old girl.
I saw the baptism dress.
Did you like it?
What are you doing, Philip?
I took my daughter to buy a dress.
You seem to suddenly think this baptism is a good idea.
You're the one who's been singing with the choir.
Your girl, Kimberly-- she has no idea her father's in the CIA, does she?
And don't call her "My girl."
I don't have anything for you.
That's disappointing.
I can't get anything.
I think there's something to get.
You're still in love with her.
I can't help you.
Wait.
You love her, too!
I want to make it right.
This defector is our only lever.
Believe me or don't believe me, but how much time does Nina have?
So, what is this?
Blue cheese.
Not a fan of the stinky cheeses.
It's the most expensive cheese I could find.
Kind of an acquired taste.
I wanted to celebrate my good luck with my good friend.
I got a call from Northrop.
What do say we dump the stinky cheese and go to Manelli's to celebrate?
Did you win the lottery?
New clothes, new bag, Manelli's.
So, I met this guy.
Why didn't you say so?
They help them with their bids, and I don't know really what it is, but he's nice.
The Nicaraguans are very happy about the Boland Amendment.
The Centre wanted you to know.
I'll tell Elizabeth.
Elizabeth takes things hard.
I know that.
For your friend Kimberly.
You don't like that.
I don't think you can reliably run her any other way-- long-term.
There's nobody better.
But Paige, Kimberly, Martha with her baby fever-- that's a lot for anyone.
I can imagine it might be confusing, even for you.
I'm not confused.
"Confused" is the wrong word.
It's difficult for all of us sometimes to keep in mind that when people's lives intersect with our operations, it's the operation that's crucial.
And when the person involved is so young...
But conscience can be dangerous.
Yeah, I'm a little bit country.
They're actually almost cute.
Nice place.
It's all my stepmom.
She's into decor, but I never let her into my room.
You want to see it?
Hey, look what I brought.
So, you spend all your time trying to convince them to vote the way that the companies want them to vote?
Yeah, pretty much.
That's why I'm hanging out with you.
Or maybe I should be working with your dad in the State Department.
Yeah, think again.
Do you even know what division he's in?
Agriculture.
It's so boring.
He must know a lot about soil.
Yeah, no, really, he does.
We used to have this garden when my mother was still alive.
I mean, my-- my real mom.
Right out there.
He showed us how to plant seeds, and all different depths, and my brother and sister, when they were still around, we would just, like, water and weed and all that stuff.
Carrots, squash, these little, tiny, like, watermelon, crappy watermelons, like the size of a rubber ball.
And me and my dad, we had these two rakes.
There was a big one, and there was a little one.
And he would go rake on one side, and I would rake on the other, and we would just, like, meet in the middle.
She doesn't cook or anything, you know.
You know, she's on like 30 different foundations.
She's never here, and my dad-- I don't know where he is.
Hey, don't bogart that joint.
I have the greatest idea.
I love any kind of ice cream with stuff in it, you know.
Open it.
It's hot.
You know what this means?
How'd it go?
He has a briefcase that he takes to the office every day.
Anything else?
Her parents came home.
So I had to run... like a teenager.
I'm okay.
Do you think about when we learned to do this?
No.
It must be different for a man.
I don't know.
You had to find it in your mind somewhere.
They kept telling us we had to make it real to ourselves.
Is that what you do with Martha?
How do you feel about Kimberly?
I feel bad for Kimberly.
Do you have to make it real with me?
Sometimes.
Not now.
Good for you.
I just keep thinking about if Todd wasn't here.
Todd is here.
Hey, bud, want to go for a ride?
You know, one of the positives about no people is that we get to see the stars, huh?
Todd, thank you for helping me move my dresser upstairs.
Ah, anytime, Carol.
It was fun, you know?
Such a sweetie.
I stand corrected.
I don't know if you know this, but in my spare time, I like to sculpt a little bit.
It's frigging so awesome, Todd.
You guys are so adorable.
Yeah, really, really adorable.
I know, but the space isn't really helping with our repopulation plan.
I mean, look at Todd and Melissa...
They've known each other for, like, half the amount of time we have, and they're already basically living with each other.
Carol, there's a huge difference between basically living with each other and living with each other.
Well, can you at least fix my door, for Pete's dragon?
Carol, I get no respect in this community!
In fact, the whole reason I came over here in the first place was to fix your door.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a frigging sculpture.
I mean, I set up this whole frigging community!
See, Todd, anyone can do this crap!
Look, Todd cannot come in here and steal my thunder.
What would really blow them away?
What's a...
I mean, this is a game changer.
Amazing!
So how do you guys like your burgers?
Oh, you're serious?
Phil, we have to keep this cow alive for milk.
Hey, we don't know how to take care of an animal like this.
You know, Phil, I might be able to help us out here.
So you know how to milk it?
Finders keepers?
Are you five years old?
Come on, Phil.
Yeah, this is ridiculous!
Hey, hey, I'm not trying to fight with you here, okay?
I'm just trying to tell you what I could do if I was a selfish person.
But what I will do, since I'm the ultimate team player, is bypass FK and let this little mother live.
Phil, that's very big of you.
It is a pretty big sacrifice, especially considering someone in our midst might be severely lactose intolerant.
Ah, really?
Well, aren't you a martyr?
Well, if I'm a martyr, then I guess you're also gonna have to call Christ a martyr.
I'd be more than happy to keep her back there if you want.
Carol, this is perfect for the cow!
Looks like she's headed to Todd's.
Oh, good, good, good.
Friggin' Todd.
My uncle taught me this knot.
It's called a clove hitch.
- Everyone does.
Well, I don't know much.
I know that they can go upstairs, but they can't come downstairs.
Oh, my Uncle Gary was the same way.
Maybe he had some cow genes in him.
Maybe.
Uh, you know, stomach really hurting here.
Okay, well, the pain is worth it when I see the smiles on your faces.
I should go, I should go.
Todd, you're the best.
Something about a woman who can milk a cow.
Uh-oh, Todd, you big undeserving hero.
Looks like your clove hitch was not cloved enough.
Look, I know you guys are questioning my decision here, but this is something I had to do.
Baking this cow situation again.
You know, I bring the cow back home, again, and I'm a hero again.
You hang in there, girl.
Just got to milk this a little bit longer.
Boom, I still got it.
She's not back here.
The cow's gone.
She ran away.
I feel like I really let us down here.
I need cheese.
Guys, look at me and listen to me.
I know we're all frustrated, but hear this, okay?
We have to fight the very natural temptation to assign blame right now.
Blaming Todd is not gonna be productive.
No one's blaming Todd.
That's the spirit, Meliss, okay?
And I want us to all keep not blaming Todd.
He's suffering enough right now.
I'm gonna go find that cow, okay?
So you guys just hang here and relax, okay?
You know exactly where that cow is, don't you, Phil?
What?
And that is why I'm holding it.
Carol, help me out here.
So, we'll each take a quadrant.
Okay, as president, I get first choice.
Yeah, Phil, I'll take this guy right here.
Where's the frigging cow?
Come on, where are you, you old piece of crap?
You found the cow!
Good for you, good for you.
Yeah, girls are gonna be real happy you found it.
But because I am, I'm with the woman of my dreams.
I found the cow!
Good job finding the cow.
This is priceless.
So this thing's in here forever.
I'm finally moving in with my husband.
It was a double clove hitch knot.
I don't know.
It's one of those freak happenings, you know?
Here, I'll tell you exactly how it went down.
And then I went to the living room, and I reread a Twilight.
Then I did some knitting.
Then I got drowsy, so I walked back upstairs, and I got into bed, and then I fell asleep.
And I woke up, and there was a cow in my face.
And that's exactly what happened.
I'm so sorry.
Fuck!
Mom?
I think you're mistaking me for somebody who gives a shit.
You don't scare me, Mick.
Two months.
People know they're not paying.
You're a good man, Terry.
Should I drive my girlfriend to Napa Valley, drink some wine, or hop on a plane to Vegas, shoot some craps, take in a show?
I'll decide later.
The day is young, huh?
From your brother.
Ladies, thanks for coming by this morning.
We all know what happened to poor Gary last night.
You know, tragedy or not, you girls still have to put food on the table, am I right?
Make a long story short, here's what I'm gonna do for you.
No, no, he doesn't mean corners, like...
Condoms, French ticklers, all that shit, free, on me.
Just make me a list.
We're going home to sleep.
Taking the cheese, though.
What was that?
This isn't 1979.
I used to worry a lot about my hours getting cut at work, less after the settlement.
But I got a letter saying that the money might get held up.
Hey, sweetheart.
All right, I'll be out there as soon as I can.
Just sitting there staring out of the dining room window.
And I did the strangest thing.
What's going on, Abbs?
You're scaring the kids.
No, hey, hey, hey.
No, I'm serious.
What are you gonna do, call the cops on me?
I don't call cops, Abbs.
That's your thing.
I'm good, thanks.
You look fine.
I think I have a fever.
Oh, for fucksakes, go back to bed already.
What's going on?
Does she need a reason?
She misses you.
Yeah.
My father says you walk on water, Mr. Donovan.
Who is this?
Paige Finney.
Does your father know you're calling me?
Does it matter?
Distilled or sparkling?
It's okay.
I want us to be partners.
We split the business.
I know Ray pays you okay, but he's not gonna make an offer like this.
Give me the day.
Ugh, Mick... figure it out.
How'd you do last night?
Well, it's me versus an app, and the app is winning.
Mickey, I'm tired, okay?
Coffee and a donut, on me.
Great, let me get some coffee in you.
Hey, Pop, who died?
All will be revealed.
Hey, darling, all right.
Grab the front.
Got it?
I have a client who has booked a threesome for this afternoon in Beverly Hills, and it pays 2 1/2 times the normal rate.
Make room.
You know, being here this morning, it made me realize I'd like to get back into boxing.
I'll get you set up.
You just got to... put your name there, and sign right there.
Yeah, sure.
It's been real helpful.
What am I to you?
Come on, Lena, not today.
Do you see me as your assistant or your intern?
What's going on?
You need more money or something?
No, I don't need any more money, Ray.
Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to prevent this kind of thing from happening?
It's handled.
All right.
Avi asked me to come work with him.
What's he offering?
Sparkling water.
And the chance to be his partner.
Told him I'd think about it.
Well, you wouldn't have told me about it if you weren't.
How are you sleeping?
Parkinson's tends to progress a little faster in here.
You'll need a wheelchair in a year or two.
You want me to put you on the disability list?
Get you a cane?
I don't need a cane.
God damn it, Conor.
Conor?
What the fuck!
I was making my bed!
Right over there.
This kid's a fucking wreck.
He's a rookie.
You're quite the miracle worker, aren't you, Ray?
What are we doing today?
You like football?
Sure.
All right, you fix this, you got tickets on the 50-yard line for life.
Walk with me.
Troy has a thing for married women.
Why you talking about that?
Why are you wearing your sunglasses?
I need you to handle this quickly.
I'll see you soon.
If he's a former client, why is he your problem?
Because every former client is a future client.
We all set here?
We sent emissaries; he was not friendly.
Good to know.
What's the job?
Keep an eye on that quarterback.
We're gonna need starter cash.
See, that's why I told you to hold on to that money.
It's all in the condo.
I'm land-rich/cash-poor, like all the big guys.
Hey, Pop, I don't like the way she's looking at us.
So she's a little weird.
Here we go.
You... be a good boy, hm?
Sure.
I take that to mean we're in business?
You understand the terms, right?
Come on, let's walk to your car.
Hey, gorgeous.
Oh, yeah, we're making big progress, uh-huh.
Give me the title.
Sorry, what?
Yeah, yeah, Shirley Temple is ready for her big entrance, and we're headed there now.
You got cancer or something?
I'm in costume.
They do good work.
Here you go.
Oh, and what's that?
10K.
This car cost me $70,000.
You know what, I'll take that.
I'm your bank now.
Hurry up, I don't want to hit lunch traffic.
Soon, sweetheart.
Hey, who's in the mood for a taco, huh?
What's up?
I walked into your son's bedroom this morning, and he was watching porn... and fucking his own bed.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Your son Conor stuck his teenage dick between his box spring and his mattress and fucked his own bed.
Did you ever do that?
No, that's a new one.
I'm sorry you got dragged out here this morning.
It's all right.
I was glad to see them.
Bridget really wants you to come tonight.
I'll see what I can do.
All right.
Well, I hope we see you tonight.
Excuse me.
Ode, ode, take five.
I ran your credit card three times.
It's no good.
Look, our last promoter didn't pay us.
We don't even have a venue right now.
Sorry.
All right.
Then we'll clean out the lockers.
So you're a wrestler, huh?
Not "wrestler," "luchadora."
There's a difference.
What's the difference?
One is SummerSlam steroids bullshit.
What's your character's name?
Her name's Mind Your Business Maricon.
I'm not taking the money.
Mind if I sit for a minute?
You mind?
Burning her stuff, huh?
Shoes burn like a motherfucker.
They stink when they melt.
Feel any better?
Depends on when you're talking to me.
Changes, doesn't it?
You hate her one minute, miss her the next.
She fucked around, but somehow it still feels like your fault.
You know, you could have been a VA counselor.
It's not a compliment.
I'll ask you to be on your way now.
For what it's worth, I've been where you are now.
No one was offering me half a million dollars.
This book I read,
The Privileged Few, it's about rich motherfuckers who believe they're better than other people.
By the same logic, a wealthy white man, he sees my wife, he says, "I like her look.
"She got a wedding band on, but who gives a fuck?
"'You want to put it in her asshole, just... fuck away.'"
I want my wife.
Hey, mister, you got mold in that locker room.
That shit is a health hazard.
What are you gonna do about it?
You're not even a member here.
You said we was gonna work something out, right?
Yeah, but...
So today I'm a member.
Damn right, you will.
Shirley's the main part.
They'll give me a trailer and a big hotel room.
And a big car, bigger than yours.
Cool.
My mom and I will get a bunch of money, like millions.
Yeah, I really don't think anyone's giving you millions of dollars.
Of course they will.
They gave Scarlett Johansson $10 million.
You're just some car person.
And you want to know what you all got in common?
Ain't none of y'all gonna play Shirley Temple.
Except maybe... the really talented ones.
Like you maybe.
Shirley, honey.
Stop drinking all that soda.
Hey, we're really late!
Give me $5,000.
Pop, are you out of your fucking mind?
All right, there, good.
It's all there.
Who slept with your wife?
Bet he wasn't part of your fantasy football team.
No, he wasn't.
What'd you do about him?
I let it go.
That forgiveness shit ain't so easy.
We're heading there now.
What's this meeting gonna look like?
I want to make money just like the next man, okay?
I mean, I'm open-minded, but you can't keep giving me this stuff in bits and pieces.
I need to see the bigger picture, what you're trying to do, you understand?
I do, and that was very well said.
We're not selling coke.
The whores are selling the coke.
Did you kill that pimp?
Technically, the water killed the pimp.
They won't give me a second chance.
Oh, the hell they won't.
Nicole Adamson.
Hold on, you're not finished with Audrey Andrews yet.
We've seen enough.
This is a little girl's future you're talking about.
Now bring her back in there.
Fuck you, Mickey.
Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Lafell.
Team representatives are up there now.
I'll be up in a moment.
Yeoman work, you're on my Christmas card list.
Keep me company for a minute.
I started my business with my own money.
My first signing was a seventh-round draft pick.
He wound up starting for San Diego.
Why?
Just remember, I didn't break the law, and neither did you.
You... you a fucking liar!
Troy, your arm!
Kid's screaming for a rematch.
We're gonna wind that shit back up on the yard later.
No thanks.
Have some racial pride and man the fuck up.
- What for?
- For your protection.
These Aryans don't play by Queens rules, man.
Fuck my brother.
I'm not going in the fucking hole.
Do the other side now.
Clean the metal.
Put muscle into it.
How do you know?
How much more?
A thimble-full.
What the fuck do you think you're looking at?
Pervert too.
Man, this is one shitty gym.
Hey, chief, I had an idea.
You okay?
Yeah, what?
What if you host our events and we split the door?
Do, like, a five show run.
Maybe we'd all make some money.
What does something like that cost?
In Houston we turned 20 into, like, 60.
Someone to break bones for you?
I'll remember that.
You like a little blood, don't you, Paige.
Does it turn you on, hurting people?
You better watch what you say to me, Ray.
What are you gonna do?
Call your daddy, have him sort this out for you?
Is that the best you can do?
Or I'm gonna put you in the trunk of that Aston Martin and drive it off a fucking cliff.
You ready, ding?
I'm here, ain't I?
Crack that piece of shit, Garth!
Governor, be well.
You got what I came for?
Oh, straight to the point, I like that.
She doesn't often ask for my help, so you must have scared her half to death.
She's been that way since she was a little girl.
Thinks the world is a cruel place.
Your check, Mr. Donovan.
Children of the wealthy don't always have it as easy as you think.
You making excuses for them?
Oh, yes, I am, because I'm retiring soon.
I need someone to keep an eye on my kids while I settle my affairs.
So I had a contract drawn up to buy you and your services and your company lock, stock, and barrel.
The numbers don't suit?
Take the job with Avi.
Why?
Because you don't want to be my partner right now.
Fuck it.
Big picture you wanted, right?
We supply the girls cocaine and the ability to front cash.
We split the proceeds with the girls, get them up-selling these fuckers.
Expand.
You know, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but that actually makes sense.
I see it as a franchise.
Keep track of the ladies.
And for that, you will have a 20% stake in this operation.
That's my car on the hook... 50/50.
Young man, I will tell you what my father told me.
Hey, sweetheart.
Where are you?
Something came up.
What are you doing?
I didn't fucking lie to you.
I thought I told you the first time.
I don't want that bullshit money.
Don't be fucking stupid.
Take the money.
So I had a contract drawn up to buy you and your company lock, stock, and barrel.
I'm not for sale.
So we're still negotiating.
Mickey Donovan.
They sell the johns coke, and when Johnny wants to do 'em a second time, can't pay for it, we loan 'em the money.
We split the proceeds with the girls, get them upselling these fuckers, expand.
Got a thing for the muscle girl, Bunch?
Those Mexicans won't pay their dues.
You like rules?
What's going on?
She wants you home.
Troy's most recent distraction is the wife of a Navy SEAL.
I need you to handle this quickly.
I'm authorizing you to go up to $500,000.
I'm not taking the money.
Take the money.
Daddy?
I'm sorry I didn't make it home for dinner.
Yeah?
Why didn't you come?
Daddy?
What the fuck happened to you?
Why didn't you take it?
I spent 25 years being told what to do.
Spare key is in the third drawer of my desk.
And your coffeemaker's busted, so I got you a new one.
What is this shit?
If you don't want to listen, hey, you're free to go.
This is for you to sell.
Each one of you can take as much as you think you can move.
We split the profits.
He'll be your personal driver and bodyguard.
As for me, I'll take care of your advertising and your time management.
I'll place your ads, handle your incoming phone calls, keep track of your whereabouts from here.
End of the day, you'd rather be independent operators, no harm, no foul.
What's going on?
I'm investing in a business.
Mexican wrestling?
Luchadores.
They're training at the gym.
Thought we could put on a few shows.
Where is he?
Isolation, for now.
Warden's talking about moving him.
I'm coming out.
I'm serious, Ray.
We can make a lot of money for the Fite Club.
It's a front, Bunch.
It's not supposed to make money.
I understand, but he'd still like both sides of the story insured.
I already signed his nondisclosure.
Who the fuck are you?
Mr. Goldberg's our family attorney.
Just telling you which way the wind blows.
Oh, shit.
Looking up, Pop?
I mean, we spent all that money that you got from the Armenians on that coke just so six hookers can get high all day.
They understand the value of a solid business plan.
What are you so worried about?
You do know I only have one car, okay?
I mean, how am I supposed to drive seven girls around?
Why the long face?
That's what they say to the horse, you see, 'cause a horse has a long face.
You got Mickey Donovan.
You have a phone call from an inmate at the California State Correctional Institution.
Will you accept the charge?
Sure, sure.
Dad came home last night.
My teacher says that I need a tutor.
He said that public high school didn't prepare me for Rossmore's standards.
Jeez, Bridge.
And calculus is hard.
Bother?
You just put me there because of what happened with Marvin.
I'll take the bus.
What the fuck are you doing?
Who's the best boy in the whole world?
You are.
But I got a fucking appointment.
You don't leave of your own free will, you're leaving in a cop car.
What are you doing here?
- Matty Flynn?
They listen to him.
What are you doing?
You think I don't know that, Mick?
You stay out of this.
Are we understood?
Ray Donovan.
Hello?
- It's important.
Can you get him transferred?
It wouldn't change anything.
Anywhere he goes, his jacket goes with him.
Now, if your brother had killed a Norteño or a Blood, man, maybe I could help you, but the Aryan Brotherhood, they've got most of the guards and the warden in their fucking pocket.
Why are you telling me this?
So you'll understand the fucking magnitude of the favor I'm doing for you.
If I get caught with you here, I'm fucked.
S07.
What the fuck happened to your face?
What the fuck happened to yours?
You all right, Ter?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yeah, it doesn't matter anymore.
I'm through.
I'm just gonna get worse.
I got nothing to come back for.
What are you talking about, you got nothing to go back for?
Who's gonna look after me if you go down?
Frances don't write me.
The club ain't mine.
My body's shutting down.
Time's up.
Kevin's gonna keep you here in isolation.
I love you, Raymond.
But I don't want your fucking help.
W-E-T-T-I-C-K?
Judge?
When someone's famous, their house is hard to find.
Stay here a second.
Who's the kid?
Terry ran into a problem at the prison.
Does Ray know?
Look, what else are you gonna do?
I don't know if you remember me, but you sentenced my brother Terry.
Armed robbery, assault and battery.
I was hoping we could talk inside.
Prison's no place for a man like my brother.
Our prison system has been corrupted.
Private corporations have turned it into the new California Gold Rush.
We've built too many prisons too fast and given control away to the very men we incarcerate.
Terry's a good man.
He doesn't belong in there.
A good man who murdered a fellow inmate.
That was self-defense.
That's for the court to decide.
I can't help you, Mr. Donovan.
$50,000.
You get the second payment when my brother's home.
I would have thought you'd have more imagination than this.
Take the fucking money.
Leave... now.
Take your money with you.
Ray, what the fuck's going on?
Oh, my fucking God.
Ray, where's Lena?
I'm worried about you, Ray.
I want to help you.
What are you gonna do, Abs, huh?
It's about Terry.
I don't have time for this.
My mom said if you want to make a man run fast, act needy.
I got to take Cindy and Alex downtown.
Shit.
Just pile in, everybody.
No, no, no, that's what's up, 'cause this is for Pop.
All right, right here, this is Michelle, okay?
She needs some pictures taken for her profile on the website.
Come on.
You can't get my face in.
We're very happy that Tara's dad has come to talk to us about his exciting work in law enforcement.
Agent Barnes was instrumental in hunting down the notorious criminal Patrick "Sully" Sullivan.
He capped that motherfucker!
And Agent Barnes has recently been named the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Los Angeles Bureau of the FBI.
Agent Barnes.
It's a real pleasure to be able to talk to your students.
Who killed Sully Sullivan?
You gonna take us all down, Ray?
After all this shit, you're going to open that fucking box back up?
All right, what judge sentenced him?
Wettick.
All right, what do you want me to do?
He's up for re-election.
I want you to go after him for campaign fraud.
Once the press gets wind of it, kills his campaign either way.
If I do it, you give me that fucking tape.
You do this, you'll never see me again.
Fuck.
Where's Daryll?
Where am I gonna get breast milk?
Who's Gary?
No possession of a police radio or a scanner.
No firearms, no knives, and no leaving town.
Yeah?
How many dates with a new lady friend before you try to seal the deal?
Get out.
Terry killed an Aryan in County.
Oh, boy, boy, boy, boy.
You got to help me get him out.
I'm a fucking parole officer, Mick.
I know all of them, but I just can't fucking go after...
You're as responsible as I am for putting him in there, and I'll make sure everyone knows it if you don't get me to that judge.
Jesus Christ, Mick.
This is my boy I'm talking about.
You're going to get me to that judge.
I'm just gonna get the most expensive formula they have.
Figure it out.
Oh, and I need adult diapers.
I'm not supposed to be here while my mom's working.
It's frozen.
What the fuck is going on here?
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, baby, what are you doing here?
You need to go home.
You should be fucking ashamed of yourself.
It's just part-time.
I can't fix his nose in here.
Just finish stitching him up.
I'm going to cut your fucking head off!
- We're done.
Warden took me off of my detail.
Call the fucking judge.
Nice flowers.
What can I do for you?
I'm going to tell you what I told your son.
I can't be bought.
If you wanted to help your son, you should have done it four months ago.
I'll tell you the way it works.
Fuck you.
What did you do?
He just fell down.
Come on.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Don't die.
Come on, please don't fucking die.
You just killed another one of your kids, Mick.
Clean it up.
We even?
Ray, are we even?
Come on, Ray.
I'm home.
Put on his leash.
Mr. Finney will see you now.
Thank you, Varick.
You want some coffee?
Have a seat, please.
You want to tell me about it?
He killed another inmate, self-defense.
The other guys, uh they're gonna kill him.
That's terrible.
I need to get him out tonight.
Can you help me?
So how'd it go, Bunch?
Easy breezy, man.
I was born to pimp.
Hey, Pop.
How's Terry doing?
- What happened to Terry?
- Nothing.
What are you doing here, Bunchy?
Oh, I needed some help with the girls.
Dog?
Dog?
Dog?
Stop it.
Fucking stop it.
How many children in your family?
She died.
I'm an only child.
You must be in the middle.
Yeah, I bet your brothers are helpless compared with you, huh?
I don't know.
Governor Verona will not be happy.
Cusp of an election.
Numbers are tight.
Andrew.
Tom.
This is my good friend Ray Donovan.
Nice to meet you.
You have my every confidence.
Gentlemen.
So, Andrew, what can I do for you?
Ray was working on getting him compassionate release when there was an unfortunate incident with another inmate.
Andrew, it's not the time...
We would appreciate it if you would expedite his release.
If the press hears of this and my opponent decides to run with it?
We'll deal with the press.
I'll pardon him one week after I win my second term.
That's just a few weeks away.
You need to pardon him tonight.
My platform has been cracking down on crime, not releasing prisoners.
This is taking far longer than I thought it would.
I'll get it done tonight.
Thank you, Tom.
I appreciate your friendship, Andrew, and your continued support.
Mr. Finney, I just wanted to say...
Anything for a friend.
It was a pleasure to see you tonight, Ray.
Sign there, there, and there.
Your salary is set.
The terms of your deal are for one year with an option to extend to another at our discretion.
Whatever Mr. Finney wants.
You'll be expected for work tomorrow morning.
You can see yourself out.
I thought you were through with the Finney family, Ray.
Come in.
Why?
I just need a couple of days.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Someplace I can think.
Look after your brother.
Love you.
Mom?
You know, I'd like to go to Boston someday.
Go to Fenway Park like you guys, the Green Monster.
What's wrong, Pop?
Oh, kid.
Oh, kid.
What is it?
Sure.
Come on, guys.
They all had a very good day.
Dope was easy to move, and all the girls felt good about it.
God damn.
You got Mickey Donovan.
Thank God.
Terry's coming home, boys.
- Who's Terry?
- He's my brother.
You can't keep carrying us.
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're an ungrateful bastard, you know that?
I told you to leave me.
I fucking love you, Terry.
You think I'd ever let anything happen to you?
So what did it take?
How much am I worth on the street?
What did it cost you to get me out?
Nothing, Terry.
It didn't cost me a fucking thing.
Previously on Ray Donovan...
You like Donellen.
Yeah, it's a girls' school.
If they want to keep us from boys, they shouldn't send us boys as teachers.
This is a sound contract.
She is gonna fix the bird situation at the field.
Sort out Napier next.
She has to be stopped.
Are you fucking serious?
Hey, what the fuck is this... funny money?
Sometimes you got to push back to get some respect.
That was the deal... the letter for the team.
Mr. Donovan, I'm Thomas Romero.
After he left the Paraclete, Father O'Connor and I spoke twice a day.
Then his body was found, and I knew his past had caught up with him.
Repent... repent now or face excommunication.
I'll kill you and every one of these fucking freaks you got hiding in here!
In the name of God, the all-powerful Father, I deprive you of the Communion of the Body and Blood of Our Lord.
You think I fucking care, huh?
'Cause you're addicted to the fight.
I should go.
What time is it?
Ray said you don't want to move in with us?
Your kids don't want to wake up and see all this shit.
Give me a fucking break, Terry.
They've seen worse.
Abby, I'm trying to sleep here.
When was the last time you had a fucking haircut, hmm?
What is this?
He's breaking ties, Varick.
You'll find the terms fair.
Uh, this is unacceptable.
Finney.
Andrew, come on, we need to discuss this.
Finn!
I made coffee.
Can you pay Napier's price?
My father says $90 million is not a rational number for that parcel.
You're gonna have to be pretty persuasive to make him come down by end of week.
Well, then be persuasive.
If he doesn't sell us the land, then our little dream dies on the vine.
There's sugar on the counter in the Wedgewood.
Thanks.
You must be Teresa.
Bunchy won the fucking lottery, huh?
I see you two have met.
I'll sleep enough when I'm dead.
Guess who met the soon-to-be Mrs. Brendan Donovan.
Yeah, Pop brought her flowers.
- When does Napier land?
- An hour.
They're in the back.
These are Central American eyelash vipers.
Look, this is very dangerous and completely illegal.
Here.
You ready?
You want to tell me who microwaved the car?
I know what you're up to, Mr. Donovan... selling coke and running girls.
I wouldn't know an Armenian from a Russian from a fucking German Shepherd.
I understand you have a history of being helpful to law enforcement.
I'd like you to start helping again.
Working with us is the only way you and your kids are coming out of this with all your arms and legs still attached.
I ain't done nothing wrong, and I ain't talking to nobody about nothing.
You are shut down as of today.
Vice guys are gonna watch this building.
We see any activity, I'm bringing you and those two up on narcotics and trafficking charges.
You want to get us feeling more cooperative... better give me a call.
Do the right thing.
Package up what's left of the coke and hide it.
You were hysterical, okay?
Don't worry.
I said don't worry.
Look at my leg.
We're gonna get you to a hospital.
I can feel my face swelling up.
Are my lips turning black?
Get her out of here.
Paige, the Napier thing... it's not gonna happen.
Take it.
Your father's getting rid of me.
He's cutting me out completely, Paige.
Tell him to honor the promises that he made me.
You want me to speak to my father on your behalf?
What you should do is say thank you and get out.
What's the problem, Terry?
Why won't you move in with us?
I'm fine where I am.
I'll just have a clean shave.
You're no fun.
You're glum.
All you guys are so fucking glum.
There will be an unexpected and totally unplanned pop quiz tomorrow.
You're welcome for the heads-up.
Please take advantage and study.
Do you still want to get that cup of coffee?
So why did you?
Because I was being totally fucking inappropriate.
Got it.
I'm sorry.
Listen, I take pain medicine because of the accident.
I wasn't myself when I texted.
What the fuck are you doing here?
You fucking lied to me.
Are you going to the fucking cops?
Could you contact your brother Ray, tell him I'm here?
It's important I talk to him.
Please, just call your brother.
We already killed one piece-of-shit priest in this place.
It wouldn't be such a chore to kill another.
Hey, Bunch.
You got to get over to the gym right now.
- Romero.
That's good.
What should we do with him?
I need to show you something outside.
Clear the gym out and lock it up.
Father O'Connor told me about how you lost your mother to cancer... how your sister committed suicide... that your father was a criminal.
You had one place to turn... your church, your priest.
You're trespassing.
Call the police, then.
Better yet, call the press.
You know I don't respond well when threatened.
You don't want to do this.
You don't want to tell me what I can do and what I can't do.
Look, everything has changed, Finn.
I'm not a gay man.
Keep telling yourself that.
Love?
Been over a long time, Varick.
I don't feel a fucking thing.
- That's not true.
- I think it's time you left.
Well, I'm not finished talking.
Nobody's interested in whatever it is you have to say.
What happened?
Are we safe?
I'm so fucking stupid.
I never should've gone to those fucking meetings...
Never should've opened my mouth or trusted people.
You talk about shit that should stay quiet, and you pay a price.
Well, I'm fucking done with all of it.
What are you doing here?
You can't just come to my house, Bridget.
I hate them.
We have something in common.
Are you all right?
It's my medication.
Can I use your restroom?
Did he have a weapon?
So you just hit him with this poker?
It was an accident.
Doesn't look like an accident.
I just wanted him to back off.
How long ago did this happen?
So what'd you call me for?
What do you think?
I want you to clean this up.
Too fucking risky.
Your 3% of the franchise won't be worth much if this were ever made public.
That chair... you sat there.
We barely knew each other, and you were broken... nowhere else to turn.
I didn't refuse you, Ray, and I saved your brother's life.
Repay the kindness.
Who else was in the house?
You play gin?
We got a weekly game here... me and the other retired fellows.
I don't play gin.
Oh, well, sometimes we, uh... we go lawn bowling over there at the Senior Citizens Center over in Tujunga.
I got, uh, business to attend to.
Greg?
Don't call me that.
Can I stay?
You're just lonely, Bridget.
That's true.
Staying here with me is not gonna change that.
No matter what, you're still gonna be lonely.
I know that.
Your relationship.
Only Paige.
Varick have any family... anyone who might come looking for him?
I need you to do that now.
It takes a long time, digging a grave.
Lena says your brother's very sick.
Parkinson's only goes in one direction.
Ezra said the girl has to die.
So I was on a plane to Boston, praying to God the whole way that it can be different.
I'm in her room, waiting for the door to open, the whole time my hand on the gun, knowing it has to be me.
You have to listen to me.
I would've rather gone to prison, Avi.
I'll meet you back at the office.
What do you think?
I know what you're doing, Abby.
Why don't you take a minute in here?
You got Ray.
No, I don't.
What's the matter?
He didn't come home last night.
I thought things were better, and now, again, he's not coming home.
I don't know what to do, Terry.
Don't got to do nothing, Abby.
You're not the one with the problem.
Don't worry your head.
Hey, you know what?
What?
This is a nice fucking room.
Thanks.
I got to make a few phone calls.
I'll take you back to the club when I'm done, all right?
What happened with Napier?
It fell apart.
Varick paid your father a visit and threatened to go to the press with their relationship.
Okay, that's my father's worry, not ours.
- I need Varick's passport.
Paige, your father wants me to control this thing.
I need you to handle Napier.
- What, Amsterdam?
Mr. Donovan, you made the call to me.
Are you gonna help us or not?
Right, right.
Lena rented a car in Varick's name.
It's parked out back.
I want you to drive it down to Rosarito, use his passport at the border, then fly to Mexico City tomorrow.
This is a rush job.
I appreciate you doing this, Avi.
Ah, it's no problem.
When you get back, give me a call.
Okay.
You might be waiting a long fucking time.
Varick came to see you after Paige served him with divorce papers.
I'm gonna give you a name.
The guy's a fucking idiot, but eventually he's gonna figure out that Varick took the money and fled to Belize.
Let him leak the story.
Paige, dear, thank you for coming over.
We'll acquire the rest of the land, and then I'm gonna let you run the show.
Why?
'Cause it's a good idea, and because it's time for me to step aside and let you lead.
Thank you for this.
Where'd you bury him?
Will you sit with me for a moment, hmm?
His funeral will be you and me sitting together.
Right.
Thank you, Ray.
Varick stealing my trust fund doesn't mean a thing to my father.
Fine.
Congratulations, partner.
Congratulations.
Previously on Ray Donovan.
Nobody's interested in whatever it is you have to say.
No one wants to hear about how Andrew Finney seduced his daughter's husband?
Fuck you, you hypocrite!
I'm not fucking gay!
Repay the kindness.
Lena rented a car in Varick's name.
I want you to drive it down to Rosarito, use his passport at the border, then fly to Mexico City tomorrow.
What the fuck is going on with Bridge?
I take pain medicine because of the accident.
Lena, I need you and Avi to get me everything you can on Ed Cochran.
The head of the L.A. FBI?
You come after her or me, this goes viral.
I'm on my way to Washington.
I understand you have a history of being helpful to law enforcement.
Working with us is the only way you and your kids are coming out of this with all your arms and legs still attached.
They're gonna kill me.
I need help.
Come on.
Wait, how do you know Hasmig?
Probably didn't want to get the guy killed.
And what makes you believe I know that family?
Have you heard my new single "Mek Gisher Yerevanmich"?
I don't listen to a lot of radio.
Well, it's about the genocide, so nobody will play it.
Fair enough.
Look at this operation.
Human ingenuity, amazing thing.
Belikov's girls are coming in around 9:00 tonight on a ship loaded with coal briquettes.
Let's talk about witness protection.
I got a line on a place in Redding and a job at the Safeway there.
Fucking Redding?
Tell me those are not dreams of Mexico running through your head.
Damn, Uncle Terry, have you been practicing while I'm at school?
That's nasty.
What are you playing?
Assassin's Creed.
Well, you got him.
You want toast, Terry, with your eggs?
Sure.
3:00 a.m., you must be fucking exhausted.
Yeah.
Me and Lena did something for Mick.
Something for Mick?
That's a new one.
I have feelers out on that, yeah.
Iris, a vacationing CFO is not what stinks about the Finneys, believe me.
Ray Donovan?
He's the most corrupt motherfucker in Los Angeles.
He would be part owner of this team.
The NFL is not gonna disqualify the Finneys over a minority stakeholder.
No, maybe not, but, Iris, you know, when I ran the FBI...
You don't run the FBI anymore.
Ed, find Varick Strauss.
I need clarity on his whereabouts in 60 minutes, or I'm gonna have to put a flag in your employee evaluation.
Then flag me, you fucking bitch.
Get out, all of you.
Temporarily, right?
For good.
No, bullshit.
Pop, you dragged me in to this business, got my car blown up, and now that's my only source of income.
If you haven't learned that Mickey always draws a shit hand, that's on you.
Now all of a sudden you're, like, morally superior guy?
I don't go to your house and judge you, do I, Ray?
You don't even let me at your house.
Hey, so what, now I go to ITT Tech for web design?
You're a smart kid, Daryll.
You'll make it whatever you do.
Bullshit!
How long's the big guy been following you around?
Just started today.
They want to put me in witness protection in fucking Redding.
Know where that is?
Sure, up near Shasta.
It's fucking exile, Ray.
Ray, I love our new thing where you're bringing in work instead of scaring it away.
Finally get to meet your father.
The resemblance is uncanny.
You hear from my guy?
Email just came in.
Are you saying I'm senile?
For the purposes of the courts and our discussions with your friends in law enforcement, you're senile, and Ray will be your guardian.
I'm off to see the judge.
Listen, I'm really gonna need some credit card records.
Where the fuck are we going?
I'm taking you home.
Lena, call Flip Brightman.
I don't think it's such a big stretch.
Fuck you.
I've been studying really hard.
I'll be right back.
"Mm, Greg, help me with my proofs."
Shut the fuck up.
He's been in a foul mood all morning.
I'll talk to him.
Thank you for coming to the house, Miss Kim.
Mr. Cochran.
This is Ray Donovan, our head of security.
Mr. Donovan.
How are you?
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Donovan.
Head of security, huh?
Oh, must be a very exciting job.
My father's just going to be a few minutes.
Will you show Miss Kim and Ed Cochran inside?
Just through here.
Thank you.
Is everything all right?
Come on in.
So I think we should go over the Varick story.
So why are you in my bathroom warning me about some ex head of the FBI that might cause trouble?
You know what, Ray?
I'm not asking, Ray.
I did the job.
They're waiting.
Tell them I'm indisposed.
Nothing that would be considered incendiary in my line of work.
Involvement with radical politics?
No.
Abortions?
Mr. Cochran?
- Well, as he's your ex-husband and the chief of staff at the Finney organization, you can understand why Dybek would find it necessary to interview Mr. Strauss, yeah?
That's true.
Well, has he found a corner of the jungle too remote even for a satellite phone?
The divorce was gonna leave him flat broke, and his retaliation was emptying our joint trust and disappearing to Belize.
Would it be terribly inconvenient if you interviewed my father at another time?
Thank you, Ray.
Boy, what a freak show that was, huh?
Has that chick ever heard of Invisalign?
What do you want?
Really, that's a nice touch.
No, it's important to Ray.
It's about the Armenian genocide.
What?
Flip?
Did you get him?
No, the fucker hung up on me.
He thinks he's Johnny fucking Carson, not Flip Brightman.
Put Avi on.
Michelle, come on.
You know, Oprah said, "We got to listen to the whispers."
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
You'll see.
Listen, the point is sometimes you stay in a bad situation so long, you feel like you can't get out.
Yeah, I've been there.
But the universe, it whispers, and then you see you can do whatever the fuck you want.
Get in.
Where are we going?
Janet's parents phoned us from the hospital.
Her nose has a hairline fracture.
We've never experienced violence like this at Rossmore.
Look, until recently Bridget has been a straight-A student.
We're not meeting on a matter of bad grades, Mrs. Donovan.
Your daughter is facing expulsion, and Janet would be within her rights to bring her up on charges of assault.
Dean Bloom, if I may, I spoke with Janet and her parents, and they're willing to let Rossmore handle disciplinary actions.
Bridget, you can go back to class.
We'll notify you once the disciplinary committee has met this afternoon.
Terry.
Hey, let me unpack those.
I made a sandwich.
Thanks.
What are we looking for?
I don't know.
Bring back a Veggie Fiesta Panini and a Coke Zero.
Afternoon, beautiful.
If you're worried about being outed, Mr. Donovan, a family reunion at the station's probably not the play.
My father's done working for you.
Who is this little shit?
My lawyer.
Detective, I represent Mickey Donovan as well as his court-appointed guardian, Ray Donovan.
Which one of you assholes paid off Judge Zinn to sign this piece of fiction?
Detective Muncie, I can assure you that all of this documentation was achieved above board.
If he backs out, I am locking him up.
You do that, and we'll bleed your department dry with an elder abuse suit.
Give me a fucking break.
He wore your wire, did what you asked.
Not all of it.
It's gonna have to be enough, Detective.
Get the fuck out of here, and take your fucking paperwork with you.
Mango beef, coconut rice, you're missing out on a good time.
Hey, you're late.
Yeah.
I took a dick pic.
What?
This Cochran, he's a sexual pervert.
You took a dick pic?
It'll come in handy, believe me.
All right.
Not how I imagined it.
I'm in rehearsals, Ray.
It's a really bad time for me to leave the studio.
Nick Jonas is appearing tonight.
- What?
- You heard me.
Ray, I'm a fucking guest host, okay?
If I, on my first night, have a pop star singing about slaughtered Armenians, the network will have me back doing weather tomorrow.
Why don't you tell me?
Okay.
No, no, no.
You can't do that.
That... that's the old me.
The old you?
It was six fucking weeks ago, Flip.
Tell the Jonas kid he can go on tomorrow.
See you.
I'll be in my room.
Thanks, Terry.
- Hey, Uncle Terry.
- Hey, kiddo.
I just got suspended for a week.
Sit the fuck down.
Want to explain this?
Where did you get them?
I stole them from him.
I don't believe you.
He'll lose his job.
I love him, and he really has deep feelings for me.
I'm calling the fucking cops.
Please do not overreact.
It is not an overreaction, Bridge.
What do you think your father's gonna do when he finds out?
Do not tell him.
Just go to your fucking room.
Get the fuck out of my sight!
Come in.
Mr. Cochran was reportedly using Mr. Donovan's father as an informant on the Sully Sullivan case.
It made his career, then everything blew up in his face.
Get this FBI guy back here again.
You're sure?
You have the video?
It's prurient in nature, Mr. Finney.
I do hope so.
Hey, my friend, my name is Avi Rudin.
I need access to my unit here, but I forgot my key.
How's that?
No fucking stretch Hummer here.
You get lost looking for the ocean, asshole?
I'll call you back.
Something came up.
We need to speak to your grandma.
Come in.
Mickey, Ivan is expecting you in Long Beach.
You will make him wait on the dock, dick in hand?
Mrs. Minassian, uh, this is my son.
I have not seen this son before.
Please.
Mrs. Minassian, my father's a dipshit.
He's always been a dipshit.
Unfortunately there's nothing I can do about that.
What I can do is offer to pay you back for any inconvenience he might have caused you, so if you could come up with a number...
There is no number.
We have a deal.
He belongs to me.
Mrs. Minassian, I'm sure you can understand my father's an older man.
I don't care.
You want out?
There is no out.
Stop this.
Who is that?
It's Hasmig.
My friend asked me to come.
Who's your friend?
That man, he is a friend to all Armenians.
Sure.
Davros, get your camera.
We make pictures for the walls.
Mrs. Donovan...
Don't you "Mrs. Donovan" me, you motherfucker!
How did she get your pills?
I don't know.
I have chronic pain and... car accident.
I thought I misplaced it.
All right.
Why couldn't you just play fucking Bingo like a normal old man?
I know how bad I let you down, and when I see you with your kids...
We got to talk about something.
I'm forever grateful.
You got to leave L.A.
You sure got a funny way of showing it.
I'm not going anywhere.
Non Compos Mentis, Mick.
You motherfucker.
You did all this just to get one over on me?
I went up against the fucking Armenian mob for you.
I almost got my fucking head blown off because of your bullshit.
You only got one of me, Ray.
Okay.
What?
If that's what you want.
Good.
Any comments you may have made that reveal racial bias?
Well, people can be sensitive and read hatred into anything you say, but no, I don't believe I've said anything racist that would embarrass the NFL.
I know this is delicate, but we have to go over your sexual history.
Ed, do you feel equipped to handle the questions?
Oh, I schooled at the knee of the master.
Thank you, Miss Kim.
All right, Mr. Finney, let's see here.
Any sexual harassment suits that were settled out of court?
No.
You ever fucked the help, Mr. Finney?
Why does Ray Donovan have 3% of your football team?
I mean, did he just find it on the ground?
My daughter, Paige, handled all the details.
So it has nothing at all to do with Varick Strauss?
How about this guy?
Any idea why he might be traveling on your son-in-law's passport?
I have no idea.
Well, you know he works for Ray Donovan, right?
I didn't know.
Keep the card, Mr. Finney.
My guess is you're gonna need it.
Mr. Donovan?
Has there been a security breach?
Well, you'll be pleased to know that Mr. Finney here has passed the vet with flying colors.
My guess is the NFL is gonna approve his football team.
You're gonna get to go along for the ride, Ray.
Well, thanks for letting us poke around, Ms. Finney.
You take care now.
I'm on my way right now.
All right.
Abby's not feeling great.
Look, I wasn't lying about last night.
Okay.
I was with Lena.
You do?
What if we went back to Boston?
Be around normal people.
We'd get the fuck out of L.A.
It's good for us here.
What's good about it?
Amazing, right?
That's great.
I have to get to a meeting.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to give you the news in person.
Now that you got everything you wanted?
No.
That's too bad.
What the fuck was that?
What?
If you're gonna do that, have a little sensitivity.
Don't fucking bring her here.
I'm not listening to this shit.
I want to show you something.
Get your coat.
Thanks.
No.
It's better I do it.
Ray will kill him.
I talked to her teacher.
You're a good man, Terry.
Good night.
Hello.
What is it?
A football stadium.
Where?
Haven't funded it yet.
You like it?
It's bad ass.
Big bust.
I've seen you, you fucking piece of shit.
Norman never has to know I'm here.
A dead girl was found floating in the tidal flats early this morning.
I don't think that you killed anyone, Norman.
Mother?
Where's Norma Bates?
She's in the office with the paramedics.
You passed out.
He doesn't need to see any of this.
- Did I do it?
I was in the office closing up, and this car comes careening in.
I realize that she has been shot, so I call 911, and she dies before they arrive.
Can I possibly get out of these clothes?
What was wrong with Norman when he came down to the motel?
You don't get to do this.
Okay, I've told you all I know.
Do you not believe me?
Is there something else that you're looking for?
Chaos seems to swirl around you, and I'm not sure why.
And I want to believe you're telling me everything you know, but none of this makes any sense.
Why would this girl, after she's been shot, make the effort to drive here?
Maybe she just wanted to get to someone who could help her get to a hospital.
That's all I know.
What happened to him?
He had a bad episode.
I found him in the tub under the water.
Is she really dead?
Do you remember anything that happened when you were having a bath?
I'll come back to check up on you, okay?
I blacked out, and then she was dead?
Norman, you had nothing to do with this.
You were nowhere near her when it happened.
I'll stay with him.
Thank you, Dylan.
Do you think maybe she was coming back here to talk to me?
I mean, I'm really the only person she ever talked to here.
What did you talk to her about?
I think I talked to her a little bit about what a good mother you were, about how hard you were trying, how tough it had been for you since you moved here... and talked to her about how close we were.
Do you still like me?
What kind of a silly question is that?
You just seem... different as of late, maybe because Dylan lives here now.
No, Norman, I don't think anything is different or ever will be.
Excuse me.
She could have driven from almost anyplace in town.
Also, the car Annika Johnson drove to the motel last night, it's registered to the girl floating face-down in the tidal marsh.
I'd feel totally prepared if this was just multiple choice, but I know there's gonna be an essay section.
"Talk about the Stamp Act and how it relates to a current political issue."
Go on a picnic or a hike or something, remember what the world is like.
I think I'd like that.
You called, Alex?
That girl that was missing, she's dead.
She was shot late last night, and I know she was here.
I think you and I should be talking in a more formal setting, like an interrogation.
I've got two dead girls in two days, both with links to your club.
I'll take that as a no.
That's a pretty incriminating question, Bob.
In the computer-code section.
You just get more and more interesting.
You know, you read these parent magazines that say you should monitor, and I don't.
I-I-I guess I've always trusted him.
Yeah, I have a little time.
But we went through a lot together.
Norman and I always had each other.
But things just seem different now.
Different how?
And, um, that makes me feel really lonely.
Instead, we've made it this big deal, feeling anything in public.
What's so bad about that?
Maybe because we'd go around crying all day.
What are you doing?
You're not gonna make me go get a warrant, are you?
Maybe.
Well, where was she headed?
Like you said, I think she was heading for her room.
You're making dinner?
No, I'm making some food to bring on a picnic tomorrow.
Aw, I'd love to go on a picnic with you tomorrow, but I've got class.
Do we have Dijon mustard?
Because, Norman, what you're doing is wrong and it's stupid.
It's not possible that I just want to spend a day alone with this beautiful, intelligent, sexy young woman who has feelings for me?
You know you can't sleep with her, right?
It's not really any of your business, is it?
Oh, it is my business, because you aren't thinking with your head right now.
Whatever the reason you're going on this romantic outing, you can't sleep with her.
She's ill, Norman.
You cannot sleep with her.
You don't need to explain that to me.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
What's up?
When Annika died last night, before she died, she gave me something.
It's locked.
I'm telling you.
I don't know what to do with it.
I think Romero's looking for it, because he was here this afternoon searching her room, and he asked me if I'd found anything.
I can't open it.
Maybe you could try.
This could be really dangerous.
Good night, Dylan.
I... maybe we picked the wrong day for a picnic.
Hey, come on, maybe we can duck in there and warm up a bit.
We'll find out, at any rate.
Oh, this is fantastic.
It's a bit warmer in here.
What if it's smoky?
Go close the window.
The Arcanum Club?
Did you have any contact with either of them since you saw them last year?
It was my sister's birthday that weekend.
I honestly doubt that guy gives a damn who knows what about his sex habits.
Maybe she had feelings for him that weren't reciprocated.
I just got the feeling she was pissed.
Just out of curiosity, you know who took your place in that three-way?
I'm pretty sure she said Annika Johnson stepped in.
You warm enough?
Yes, of course.
Do your lungs hurt when you can't breathe?
More of a-a panicky feeling than a pain, like someone's holding you underwater.
I mean, no matter what you feel like...
I'm not thinking about that today.
Today I'm living.
Get on board, Bates.
What is with you?
My mother says that I shouldn't have sex with you, that you shouldn't have sex.
- What's wrong?
I think I've earned the right to make my own decisions, not take direction from two people who wouldn't know their ass from a handbag if they had a head cold.
I didn't think your mother was coming on this date with us.
Gunner couldn't haul that thing up here by himself.
Could you stop that for a sec?
I don't think it's irrational to not want to talk to the guy who raped her.
You're wanted?
Please, no hospital.
You ready?
Just do it.
Was it really like she said it was?
Yeah, it was.
Maybe not exactly.
I mean, we're so close, her and me.
We were all we had.
We were like two kids raising ourselves.
So we spent all of our time together.
It just happened.
You know, she was more than a sister to me.
I mean, she was my whole world, my whole life.
I mean, I loved her.
You can't help who you love.
One day she came home and said it was bad, you know, that we couldn't anymore.
I hate myself for it.
I know I don't deserve it, but I wish I could say I'm sorry.
That's all I want.
There's something here that belongs to us.
Put your hands out in front of you.
Easy.
Don't start something you're not gonna be able to finish.
You're dead.
- Well, yeah, but...
Nothing.
What's going on?
Dylan, what were you just talking about?
Oh, for God sakes, Norman, you're acting like a child.
Give it to me.
I don't want anything to happen to you.
Where are you going?
Norman, stay the hell out of it, okay?
Hey, what's wrong?
You could have called me or Gunner.
You doing okay?
I know it's got to... it's got to be tough on you.
Hey, get some rest.
What the hell's going on here, Dylan?
Does Mom know he's here?
Is this what you two have been whispering about?
Is she allowing this?
Well, I'm not the one harboring my mother's rapist.
Look, we don't want any trouble.
Oh, you don't want any trouble from me?
That's funny, like I'm the outsider and you're not.
We'll see who's on the outside.
Go to hell, Dylan!
Please, Norman.
Everything I've built with Mom, it'll... it'll all be destroyed.
You've already destroyed it.
You betrayed Mother, and she needs to know.
I didn't know what to do.
Norman, please.
Just seems you two have been spending a lot less time together lately.
Women swooned at the sound of their warbling.
Alas, lost to history.
Taisho or Showa period?
McKenna claims they're Edo.
Want some company?
If you're late, I pick your song.
Where's McKenna?
Is that any way to greet the woman who raised you?
I'm pretty sure you got the message.
I've been avoiding you for about a decade.
Yes.
You take care.
What do you need, Carmilla?
The job's here in Sleepy Hollow.
We're gonna rob Theodore Knox's estate.
What I've gotten myself into... my life's on the line now.
That's the way life is.
You know, Katrina was right to free Abraham when she did.
We're fine.
He said he'd only be gone a little while.
He might have just lost track of time.
Perhaps I should have done the one about the bass, about the bass.
Everything all right?
Hawley's a no-show.
That's gonna have to wait.
There's been a breach at the archives.
When did that happen?
What did you take?
What the hell was that?
The last few months have been a real roller coaster, Mr. Irving.
You have fled the police, led your own department on a statewide manhunt, committed perjury...
Then I have no choice, based on the new evidence.
This court has determined that the defendant, Franklin Irving... shall be exonerated of all charges.
Oh, my God, Frank.
I'm free.
I can't believe it.
We should have Katrina examine the creature's residue.
An undead human being of Hindu lore that serves Kali, goddess of death and regeneration.
Who is crazy fast, has inhuman strength and is immortal.
How did Hawley get involved with a vetala?
Katrina can assist me in finding Hawley whilst you two find McKenna.
See you later, Crane.
"Divide and conquer."
You really think you two work better apart than together?
Look, he's trying to figure out his relationship with his witch wife while they're mourning their Horseman-of-War son's death, which I'm guessing is pretty complicated.
So I am not gonna sweat the small stuff.
It's not gonna stay small forever, Abbie.
How can I help?
Jenny Mills.
And you've just wasted a day on paperwork.
What is this... good cop, bad cop?
This guy just tried to assault me!
And you delivered Hawley to her?
She's a treasure hunter.
And she turns the task into a leisure activity with a rather lively ditty.
So, she sings, she cleans, she... travels by parasol...
Miss Poppins seems quite fulfilled.
What is it?
This charm... is a duplicate of the Halo Blade wielded by the angel Orion.
Got a name on our vetala.
Carmilla Pines, notorious treasure hunter.
And Hawley's legal guardian from 12 to 18.
So, Mr. Hawley was raised by a criminal who is also a monster?
I believe I have discovered what Carmilla is after.
Well, before they named a fort after him, he was a revolutionary hero.
Built a home nearby used to safeguard weapons and supplies from the British.
And now Hawley has the blueprints.
Knox had a singular obsession... locks and puzzles.
He built the vault in his estate with the Sons of Liberty, a Boston spy ring, to ensure that the colonists' weapons were protected to the upmost security.
The contents in Knox's vault were considered very dangerous.
Now, this symbol in the corner represents a lever lock system.
Its tumblers for the vault... they run through the walls of the entire house, making the house like a fortress.
And this is how you crack it.
Impressive, Nicky.
Who were those people in the tunnels?
And that was before you were whatever the hell you are now.
I tried to protect you.
I came looking for you, you know?
Tracked you to Mumbai.
This is what they did to me.
It's the mark of the vetala.
I didn't want to burden you with this.
But Knox has an artifact that could give me back my life.
I got you the blueprints.
You're on your own for the rest.
Did you hear me?
One and done.
"One and done."
You enjoying yourself, Speed Racer?
If you scratch Hawley's car, serves him right.
How did Mr. Hawley come to be raised by Carmilla Pines?
When he was 12, a few days before Christmas, his parents died in an accident.
She was his godmother.
Knox holds these black market exchanges a couple times a year.
To Knox, it's not who you are, it's what you have.
So these... are our invitations.
When Carmilla arrives on the property, she will make her way to the vault.
And at all costs, we must stay together.
Talk to me.
It's the only way we're gonna make it through this.
What do you want me to do?
I don't have an explanation for this.
Only the fact that I am alive.
This job is no different from the others.
Knox is an overweight, entitled black market thief.
We're just stealing what was already stolen.
Carmilla and Hawley.
We can't lose them.
Black walnut stock, forged medieval limbs.
Thank you, Sons of Liberty.
What is Carmilla stealing from Knox?
I don't ask questions when I don't want to know the answers.
That's not good enough for me, and I thought you were better than that, too.
Okay, fine, come on, quick.
You shoot, she dies.
This one is police.
Harm her, and you will seal your fate.
There's another way to do this.
It's not gonna work like that.
Carmilla, you taught me to make deals, not mistakes.
I don't trust them.
We lock them in the vault.
A man who fights for his friends.
Maybe you had it right the first time.
We have a deal?
Deal.
Hawley, don't do this.
I'll make sure Knox knows you're in here.
I mean that.
We need a way out of here.
Can we contact Miss Jenny?
Not without cell service.
Not to add to our stresses, but I recognize the statue Carmilla stole.
The Bajrayogini Statue of Kali.
I thought the plan was for us to stick together.
Clearly, our signals were crossed.
Another failure of communication to add to our list.
What is that supposed to mean?
Well, it means the roster of our missteps is growing to karaoke catalog-sized proportions.
Does this have anything to do with me not mentioning the silent alarm in the archives?
An excellent idea.
But I cannot help but wonder why you did not share with me Orion's sigil.
We should pause this discussion until we have found a way out.
I've developed rather a distaste for being cramped in small spaces.
You were a real hero to your friends back there.
Well, I meant what I said.
I owed you better than that.
This whole thing's a con.
You won't abandon me again, Nicky.
Push the correct knob, the door will open.
Then I doubt we leave the vault alive.
Quandary, indeed.
Orion gave it to me, I used it to find him.
Felt like bringing it up after the fact was opening a can of worms.
I thought it was over.
So did I.
Okay, you are by no means the only one responsible.
I decided Abraham was worthy of saving without consulting you.
Perhaps we both decided it was easier to act than to talk.
What if this is indicative of something larger?
What if we're not as good partners today as we were in the past?
Maybe our whole thing has started to go awry.
Even in the times of great peril we could always rely on one another.
Are you having a moment?
During the war, Henry Knox's greatest achievement was stealing British cannons from Ticonderoga.
Cannons that were bonded in iron.
Forget about the war hero and the student.
We seriously named Fort Knox after a dude who died in debt.
Well, he had other redeeming qualities.
He locked us in a death trap.
I'm gonna kick his ass.
That can turn people into vetalas.
I think one vetala's enough.
It's not exactly the Ritz-Carlton.
I'll do a sweep of the perimeter, see how many guys we're up against.
We need to find a way to defeat Carmilla once and for all.
Kali has six hands, four of them holding items and two of them in specific positions.
Thank you, yoga class.
I'm still not going back.
So, the top left hand was positioned like this.
And the right hand, Tarjani.
The symbol for destruction.
The bottom two hands on the right arms had a torch and an iron stone.
We can kill her with iron and fire.
The statue works.
Carmilla, please, think about what you're doing.
You once told me I made you a better person.
I'm not a person anymore, Nicky.
Step away from him!
Can't say I blame you.
You come bearing gifts?
Well, friends don't steal from friends, right?
Look, Jenny, now you know why I... keep my distance.
But you also have a family here in Sleepy Hollow.
You know that, right?
Thank you.
I mean that.
You're leaving, aren't you?
Mills, I put you in danger.
I'm gonna hunt her down.
So, what happened when we were in the vault?
We are far greater than the sum of our parts, but we cannot rely on our bond to last unless we tend to it.
Next up is Abbie and Ichabod.
This ceremony will dig into the very fabric of your being, which may be unpleasant and dangerous.
It might be best if you stood back.
I just want my family to know that I'm free and clear of Henry's influence.
Where is Henry?
Excuse me?
The fact that you are here in the flesh tells me that my son is still alive.
Whatever magic bound you to the Horseman of War is gone.
I cannot say how you came back to life, only that my son has no influence on your soul.
I think we got ourselves a miracle.
Promise me, this is the start of a new chapter of our lives.
Henry, you're still alive.
I killed Moloch for you, Mother, for our kind.
It's time for us to begin our work.
My soul is tarnished.
My family needs protection.
You've gone to the dark side, haven't you?
That other Frank, it's about to take over and replace me forever.
That sounds like someone I know.
I shall take that as a compliment.
Oh, don't worry... you're the only one in the nonfiction section.
A cornucopia of knowledge.
Ever since everyone started downloading books from the cloud, I've had to take in research gigs just to keep the doors open.
Any luck with the titles we asked for?
It seems, absent any definitive guidelines to our role as Witnesses, we must continue to define the rules as we see fit.
We can get more specific.
Hey, forgive and forget.
All kidding aside, being a cop or a soldier, you live and die by a code of conduct.
And I believe in what we do, but it doesn't make it any easier keeping friends or relationships.
To be effective, we must put our bond as Witnesses before anyone or anything else.
So when you say you gambled away all of it,
We can work through it.
Idiot!
Michelle, are you all right?
You came with him, your lover, to my funeral?
Reyes said the disturbances were all in close proximity.
Did she mention anything else unusual?
We're on our way downtown.
- What makes you think that?
And while it was working, he was his old self.
He told me to get his family out of town before he went after them.
I told Cynthia to get Macey and get out.
Are you suggesting we use the Gorgon's head?
I want to help Frank, not turn him into a museum piece.
It's stashed in the Masonic cell in the container we used for the Horseman's head.
Right, 'cause everyone just has a head-storage jar laying around.
Eyewitness said she was choking him without even touching his throat.
Problem is... the witness had already downed half a bottle of wine.
Well, the Articles of Confederation were written on the back of a bar napkin.
Now, it does seem improbable that an electrical surge would occur at the same instant as a road rage confrontation.
In our line of work, improbable means not an accident.
Yeah, same symptoms... fugue state, no recollection of what happened.
Wait, an electrical surge, a bloody handprint, a voice from beyond the grave.
These are supernatural phenomena, and we've encountered them before.
Serilda.
These people are exhibiting magical powers.
The tolling of a bell.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
We're on to something.
The same bell's been hanging here since colonial times, and this is not it.
This bell was cast from the same mold as that famous one in Philadelphia.
A little.
Whilst that bell carries the famous name, many others were cast from the same mold.
The first of which was a target for colonial sabotage in the year 1773.
I had orders from General Washington to locate a crate bearing the mark of the Axminster Bell Company, London, and destroy its contents utterly.
In order to discern if my target was present, a diversion was necessary.
At the moment of truth, my ruse was discovered.
A time-tested tactic since Hannibal of Carthage.
Washington's orders, they now make perfect sense.
If these bells cause people to display powers of witchcraft, their use as weapons would be... undeniable.
By whom and for what purpose we must determine before it is rung again.
If we're dealing with a witch problem, we have to call Katrina.
Your dark side becomes you, as does true power.
Is this a dream?
Are you truly here?
I apologize for my temerity earlier.
I very much wanted to see you, but I-I wasn't sure how you'd react.
You are my son, Henry.
I hoped and prayed you were still alive.
In my dream, you said that you killed Moloch in order to save my life.
I did.
Instinct, pure and primal... or so I thought.
Our destiny.
I have so much to tell you.
This particular bell has definite connections to witchcraft.
This is an ancient pagan symbol, and this is the corporate emblem of Axminster Bell Company.
The very same was on the crate I sabotaged.
There was once a thriving coven in this area.
Their descendants could number into the thousands.
Only three people were affected.
Clearly, this ritual did not have the intended effect.
I hope you find my home more appealing than last time you visited.
After a long, fallow winter, spring has come again to Fredericks Manor.
You can let your guard down.
It's difficult, after all the things that you have done.
Misguided choices that I have come to regret.
You stood by Moloch's side as he sought to bring the Apocalypse.
His apocalypse, not mine.
I have something to show you, Mother.
A gift from Captain Irving.
John Dee's Grand Grimoire.
The enchantments within the Grimoire are the most powerful ever assembled and most dangerous.
Whoever holds it is capable of so much destruction.
I no longer seek wanton carnage, Mother.
You mean the Awakening Ritual.
I tried the ancient rite this morning, but it didn't take.
A few with witches' blood heard the call, but only for the briefest moment.
As my father is mortal, my blood is diluted.
Only a pure-blood witch can perform this ritual effectively.
No longer would our kind be hunted, marginalized, burned.
A coven.
He is not one of us.
In the end, he never can be.
This is a dream I cannot dream alone.
So we could have the family we never had.
I can't do this without you, Mother.
If only we had such a wealth of tools whilst building a nation.
What, pray tell, are "seasonal items"?
Uh, flashing hearts for Valentine's, animatronic ghosts for Halloween, and Christmas is, like, the Super Bowl of lawn deco.
But which holiday requires monopedal pink birds and a band of barbate pygmies?
Arbor Day.
Last on the list.
If memory serves true, there is an entrance to the tunnels via an alleyway off the town square.
All we need is to drag the bell inside, place the charge, light the fuse...
Uh... is that a CD, or a cologne?
'Cause we don't carry either.
A lighter.
Lighters require refueling, whereas flint and steel can always be relied upon.
I got this.
You two... blow that bell to hell.
My family... where are they, Jenny?
Tell me where my family is.
Or next time, I shoot to kill.
A few hundred feet should be far enough.
You must have so many questions.
Let Katrina go.
Let's keep this between us.
You want to tell him, Mother, or should I?
You came of your own free will.
I trust what I feel.
He has done nothing but try to destroy us.
He saved me from Moloch.
The bell is a gift.
I am awakening what is already within their blood.
We are the innocent that have been wronged.
You are wrong.
It was always meant to be the two of us.
I've always needed her.
I am sorry it took me so long to see the truth.
The idea that a mortal man and I could truly make a life together...
You... be wary.
What you're saying now cannot be unsaid.
In a way, it is a relief to finally be able to speak it.
If this truly is your... choice so be it.
Katrina will wait until the Perigean tide is at its highest before she performs her ritual.
So, a matter of hours?
Is it possible that Henry could've cast some kind of spell on her?
There is no need to soften the blow, Lieutenant.
Yeah, you're telling me?
We must stay focused on our duty.
We take out the heart of this evil, the limbs will surely follow.
I echo that sentiment, Lieutenant.
There is another possible location.
The bell I intercepted in 1773 was en route to Sleepy Hollow Town Hall.
That town hall's been boarded up for years now.
A distraction?
Then it is fitting that this is where the bell should ring.
Our new coven rise from the ashes of the old.
When I fought the warlock Solomon Kent, he told me I had... neglected the truth about myself.
But he was wrong.
It's not about... dark magic or power.
It is about you.
We're together now.
We shall create... what we both desire most.
My darling boy.
Do you realize what you have done?
You have given me back my soul.
You have to admire his tenacity.
I know you're near, Jenny!
I recall there were two Witnesses in the Book of Revelation.
We've been here before.
You bare your teeth, then you back down!
You don't have what it takes to do violence to your only son.
You've not learned a thing since Moloch dragged you from your fetid box.
He abandoned me just as you did.
I did not abandon you, Henry.
I did not even know you existed.
How many Witnesses did I say were specified in the Bible?
You may be one short of a pair.
This is how a mother nurtures her son.
Murder in cold blood.
This path... this path will send you back.
Last chance.
A valiant attempt, clever even, Ms. Mills.
But sadly, all for naught.
You didn't even come visit me in Tarrytown.
You didn't even bring by my daughter.
How does it feel to be tied to a stake awaiting the flames?
Go to hell.
It's your turn, I'm afraid.
You will be the first to burn.
Join your power with mine.
Why stop at Sleepy Hollow when we can have so much more?
The decoy plan was a bust.
So much for the old ways.
Not entirely.
The bomb on the bell, they haven't spotted it yet.
Doesn't change the fact that we're tied up and weaponless.
I have two flintlock pistols beneath my coat loaded with Greek fire charges.
You been holding out on me?
I did say "armed to the teeth."
A direct hit to the black powder would ignite it.
How about flint and steel?
Side pocket.
I can feel them, Mother.
Our coven is awakening.
Unless we split his concentration.
Make him a target, too.
His face, he bleeds.
If he bleeds, he may be mortal.
Are you ready for that?
Duty above all else, Lieutenant.
In three, two, and... now.
No!
It's too late for that.
Save the bell.
Finish our work.
The coven means nothing without you, Henry.
Not Henry.
My family.
I'm sorry it had to end like this.
I have no regret.
"I shall not see his like again."
Father?
How did I get down here?
Cynthia.
Macey?
Tell me they're okay.
How do I know that?
You don't.
You better not be lying to me.
We tried everything we could to save him.
You... are the source of my sorrow, Ichabod Crane.
I never should have saved your life when the Horseman cut you down.
I never should have put you to sleep.
The traveler spell, it worked.
Stop!
Do you have papers?
Papers?
I must have left them in my sock drawer.
If you think what I think that you're thinking...
This is wrong on so many levels.
Clearly, she's touched.
Just speak to a judge, fugitive.
This feels weird.
Well, and because of us.
Mona set her up and then was killed herself, and now Ali's going down for it.
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
We're gonna figure out a way to get you out of here.
She really wanted to be here, but she had to spend the day with her mom.
We'll be back soon, okay?
Aria?
You know I'm gonna have to tell my lawyers about Mike, right?
No, we've been trying to find "A's" henchman.
We thought that "A" was in a jail cell.
- I'm sorry, you guys, I chickened out.
She is a liar.
Up until yesterday, we all thought she was a murderer, too.
Well, you guys didn't make a personal appearance to cut her open, pour salt in the wound, and then exfoliate it.
I'm fine.
Can they make him take the stand?
Once Mike becomes Ali's get-out-of-jail-free card, he also becomes "A's" number one target.
This family has bent over backwards to keep you out of that place, and now you're voluntarily showing up there?
If you're going to skip school, then it's going to be so you can get into a better one.
Have a nice day.
I'm the Contestant Coordinator of the Glass Slipper Collective.
What's this?
Each one of you is also assigned a fairy godmother to help you walk through it.
Um, my boss is out of town for the day, but when he gets back I'll talk to him about swapping some shifts.
Oh, you tell your boss you're a very promising contestant.
You and I don't have attorney-client privilege.
I know it's not your usual rate, but for the next hour will you be my lawyer?
I know Amanda was going to be helping you in the kitchen this week, but something's come up, and I was hoping she could cover my shifts instead.
This is how it's going to be?
I mean, I didn't say what I said to hurt you.
Yeah.
How much trouble would he be in?
Spencer, you cannot leave now!
What did Toby say about this?
Why not tell the truth?
Are you serious?
Aria, Spencer's mom can help Mike.
No, she can't help us find "A."
I want to know why my daughter and her friends are visiting you all of a sudden.
Shouldn't you ask your daughter that?
I've heard that your own brother refuses to come here.
So why would these girls?
Because I'm telling the truth.
Unfortunately, Alison, with the lies you've told, even if your friends believe you, it's doubtful a jury will.
That's why I want to take the stand.
You could say the wrong thing and wind up incriminating yourself.
But I can't just sit here quietly while someone gets up there and tries to make me look like a murderer.
Alison, you've told so many lies.
Your lawyers are going to have a hard time finding a juror willing to believe you.
I want to tell my side, because, for once, it's the truth.
Well, I don't know what to say.
What would you say to Spencer?
She was almost in this room.
I know what people think about me.
And I know it's hard to change someone's mind once it's made up.
But I have to try.
Then you'll need a very good coach.
Did you forget about me?
But if you're gonna blow off studying, how about squeezing in a movie?
What do you say?
I'm still sort of seeing Ezra.
Sort of.
We'll go as friends.
Mm, sounds entertaining.
You won't be sorry.
Sorry, I must have the wrong apartment.
Flat.
What?
Apartments are flats.
I'm afraid I'll be playing your host for the next 24 hours.
Wren and Melissa won't be back until tomorrow night.
My sister isn't even here?
Wren's boss invited them to his country home in Kent.
I imagine after your flight you're a bit peckish.
How do you feel about... stale biscuits?
Children, not biscuits.
Right, I'm interested in a few of them actually.
At the risk of sounding like a nosy git, may I suggest that in light of your impending interview that you tuck away your mobile and pick up a course catalogue?
Are you going on a trip?
Not exactly.
I was pretty open with him and it didn't go so well.
We're separating.
Talia, did I make you have a conversation you weren't ready to have?
It was going to happen sooner or later.
So what are you gonna do?
Your mom would be okay with that?
She's away.
Didn't you tell me there's a way to see if someone's read the email you sent them?
Not if you didn't attach the thing you need to attach to do it.
I'm gonna take this upstairs.
I really need to talk to Cyrus.
Stop saying Hank, it's confusing.
So where is Cyrus?
He's being treated at Taft Memorial Hospital.
I called, but he can't have visitors until tomorrow.
Hanna, we need to go down there and talk to him before he disappears again.
Wait, why are you willing to go down this road with a guy who tried to run you over with his hog?
When Mike met up with him, Cyrus admitted that he was paid to set Ali up.
So if we can just talk to him again, maybe he can give us some sort of insight into who contacted him.
Why would he tell us now?
I mean, he's kind of a scary guy.
Yeah, well, he's also our only link to the real "A."
Well, why stay in America?
I believe it was William Fulbright who said that international education is our best opportunity to turn ideologies into human aspirations.
With that being said, how could I do any better than the oldest university in the English-speaking world?
Who are you again?
We're his cousins.
You can't bring those in.
Put these on.
Are you sure that this is really necessary?
We're just gonna go see him for a second.
Uh, I would be happy to write a note introducing myself to her if you wouldn't mind...
I just came to drop off your key.
You don't sound thrilled, why do it?
Emily, it was a compliment.
But, yeah, maybe it's for me, too.
But that's part of it.
I keep thinking if I work hard and win this, then I'll know I have it in me to take control of my life.
That must sound pretty stupid.
Not at all.
You're gonna dance with me.
Hey, Cyrus, we wanted to come talk to you, but we didn't realize you'd been in such a bad accident.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean?
Wait, are you saying someone did this to you?
Cyrus, what happened?
Carjack?
Okay, time to say goodbye.
It's mine or yours or Mona's?
Aria, I'm freaking out, okay?
"A" put Cyrus in the hospital.
Miss, you better take a step back or I'm gonna have to call security.
I can't do it.
Turn... drop.
Next time wear pants.
Well, you could have distracted her.
And meanwhile, "A" is tying up loose ends and Cyrus is one of them.
You think that "A" is going by the name "Varjak?"
Why not?
I mean, Spencer always said how Ali was obsessed with Breakfast at Tiffany's .
She turned into Holly for that fake passport.
Maybe "A" is taunting her by being Paul Varjak.
Cyrus spelled it wrong.
That's awesome.
Or it means that he's never seen it written down.
Did you find a bedbug?
No, I'm just repacking.
Actually, maybe you could call me a cab.
I want to go home, tonight.
Look, I didn't eat a crayon, okay?
Focus on your breath.
Imagine the breath going deep into your belly, surrounding all that nervous energy... and letting it out.
Do you want to talk about it?
Well, then can you at least leave the bedbugs and let me make you something to eat?
Emily, when you filled out the application, did you read the entire thing?
You should have at least mentioned it to me.
We can't force you to do anything.
Only encourage you.
This is about your close connection to the Alison DiLaurentis case.
The board is concerned that if you participate, our sponsors will drop out to avoid any negative association.
Did you hear back about a job?
No, not yet.
Ted called.
We went for a walk and talked and... the rest is history.
No I'm, I'm happy for you.
If he'd just said "okay" right away, that wouldn't have been honest.
He needed to come to it on his own time.
Well, didn't that make you sort of wish you hadn't apologized?
No.
I feel awful about what I did, and I needed to say that.
Not only for him to forgive me, but for me to forgive myself.
I really am fine.
Thank you for everything.
Uh, Emily just wanted you to know that she understands the board's position.
Uh, we're just concerned that if anyone found out you wanted her to drop out because of a friendship she has...
That friend is on trial for murder.
But in this country, you're innocent until proven guilty.
Unless the pageant judges know better than the ones on the Supreme Court.
Are you threatening me?
I'm encouraging you.
Perhaps your sponsors could make a donation toward Emily's education.
Did you seriously just ask her to send me a check?
They're not going to do that.
You never know.
Uh, I can't find Mike.
I'm looking for his schedule right now.
Han, I'm gonna call you back.
Yeah, I'm up here.
That's weird.
If your brother had been on this, the weights would have crushed his skull.
This hurt?
Yeah, a little.
I don't think it's broken, but you might have a sprain.
What were you doing on top of that thing anyway?
I'm basically a human stepladder.
You know, for such a petite girl, you bring a lot of chaos.
Math equations, jigsaw puzzles, complicated girls, they don't scare me.
But what does scare me is this swelling.
We might need to get a doctor to look at this.
Spencer, call me as soon as you get this.
I want you to cancel your flight home.
I brought you some magazines.
But they took them.
I'll do that.
Ali, I've been thinking about what I said to you.
Hanna, please don't apologize.
I honestly thought that I was helping you guys.
Telling you what to wear, how to act, who to like.
I can't even decide what to wear, what to eat... and when to shower.
I never realized колко лошо се чувстваше, за да си от другата стана на това.
Съжалявам.
Мислиш ли, че ще можем да почнем отначало?
Не знам
Но можем да опитаме
Но само ако си честна с нас... за всичко
You will be here, prosecution there.
I don't like the idea of 12 strangers off the street deciding what happens to my daughter.
It's the American way.
They know nothing about me.
If I could just tell them the whole story...
Alison, we've discussed this before.
The key to winning this case isn't telling the jury desperate stories about being plotted against.
Our job is to prevent the prosecutor from proving his case.
Right now, he has the tougher job.
All we have to do is make one of them unsure.
One of them?
That's all it takes.
Opening statements in Alison's trial begin at 9 a.m.
I'm gonna be there.
And I think we know who that somebody is.
I told you it's not Ali.
Alison DiLaurentis is capable of anything.
I've experienced that firsthand.
But you can't be certain.
Certain enough.
Hanna, if you know anything about her, now is the time to speak up while it can still help you.
Do anything to save myself?
What part of scripture is that from?
This is about telling the truth, Hanna.
I am telling the truth.
I didn't do anything and Ali didn't do anything either.
I don't care about the truth!
The number off of the Varjack receipt is the same number as the personal ads in Ali's house.
How does this help Hanna?
Well, if Ali's not guilty, then they can't charge Hanna as an accessory.
You can't help someone commit a crime that they didn't commit.
But Ali already told us that the letter and the passport are fake.
Why do we think the number and the ads are real?
Yeah, and meanwhile Neilan's Law Office is closed and locked.
What if we don't figure it out in time?
The three of you are gonna be late for school.
Oh, then, uh, this is my chance to talk to all of you.
I want to strongly suggest that you girls stay away from Alison's trial.
This is a suggestion?
For Emily and Aria, yes, for you it's more than a suggestion.
What is Ali gonna think if we're not there?
I'm more concerned about what other people will think.
Juries have eyes.
The whole town knows that we're friends with her.
Yeah, if we don't go, it'll be like saying we think she's guilty.
I can't tell you and Emily what to do, but consider your actions.
Okay, so what are we gonna do when Hanna goes to trial?
That's for sure.
Everything I've tried to trace this number back to a source just disappears into a black hole of nothingness.
No tagged ID, no localizing signature, the phone on the other end could be on Mars or on the other side of this room.
An insanely secure phone and somebody uses it to order pizza?
Do you have a burner phone?
What color?
It's just gonna keep ringing.
Well, let's see what happens when I put it in writing.
Holly Golightly or Holly Varjack?
Ali's running out of time.
I don't know.
Are you gonna be visiting Hanna today?
Tomorrow, but she said she'll try to call me today.
She has to get to Ali and ask about the phone number.
You need to listen to me, okay?
Please, we need to talk about how Ali isn't guilty.
What you want doesn't help Alison.
We're neighbors at least for the moment.
In case you forgot, your house is the one with the big gate and the wall.
Stay on the other side of it.
Very successful.
Good.
They're turning it into a field trip.
I guess he thinks that's best for Alison.
I'm getting a little tired of memorializing Mona.
Mrs. Horowitz keeps talking about her.
Looks like she's ready to nominate Mona for sainthood.
Our best scholar, our martyred hero, like she won every championship on her own.
I guess she was a pretty aggressive competitor.
Not aggressive, vicious.
I've seen her intellectually kneecap dozens of kids, and the only thing Mona likes better than winning is taking the credit.
We're lucky she didn't get to college and start thinking about running for president.
Are you saying that the world's better off without her?
I'm just saying there are other people on this team.
You have a call from inmate Alison DiLaurentis.
To accept this call, press 1.
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't call to say that.
I'll try.
Somebody said it was raining.
Is it raining back home?
Yes, it's... it's raining.
Remember high school?
Remember when every hallway slight was like an assault?
When allegiances and enemies were magnified out of all proportion?
Miss Marcus will be up here shortly and she is going to tell you an amazing story about Alison DiLaurentis.
How she was kidnapped and traumatized by two years of captivity.
How she escaped her captors and returned home, helped by her closest friends.
It is a remarkable story.
It's breathtaking.
None of it happened.
It's a fairy tale.
The commonwealth will prove, with direct testimony of witnesses, that Alison DiLaurentis' epic tale of abduction and escape is a lie.
It is a lie created by her and perpetuated by the friends that helped to "save" her.
Mona Vanderwaal knew the truth.
She had the power to destroy the fantasy created by Alison and maintained with her little group of followers.
And that is why Alison DiLaurentis planned and carried out the murder of Mona Vanderwaal, consigning her to a cruel, anonymous end.
Spencer, he said they've got witnesses.
The cops must have found Cyrus.
He knows the whole kidnapping story and he'd do anything to save himself.
Aria, where's Mike?
You heard all that?
Yeah, I heard.
Somebody planted them, but I hid things in the house too.
Everybody hides things, Hanna.
Who were you talking to?
Not talking, texting.
When my mother was killed, somebody bought a tribute out in the paper.
All it said was "Goodnight, light" and the red balloon and a response number, a code the papers use.
My mother used to read that to me when I was a baby.
So I answered and 2 days later another ad, "goodnight nobody, goodnight brush."
"Goodnight to the old lady whispering hush."
And then a phone number, I sent a text.
Why didn't you tell us you were doing this?
You've been talking to "A" and you never said a word.
Aria killed Shana in New York.
Okay, my mother was buried in Spencer's backyard.
I was afraid that you were gonna get hurt.
Whoever it was, said they knew who killed my mother.
They were just torturing me.
It wasn't "A," it was Mona.
How are you so sure it was Mona?
The only thing I know for sure is that the texts stopped when Mona was killed.
Emily and Aria were at the courthouse today.
Well, whoever told you that must have told you that I wasn't there with them.
Did you know what was gonna happen?
Too late to do anything except to warn me not to be there?
Maybe now you understand why I did that.
I'm still trying to understand why you and Melissa lied to me and tried to keep me from coming back when my friends needed me?
Someone will be going to prison for a very long time.
My only concern is that it's not going to be you.
Don't you want to ask me if I knew about Ali's fake kidnapping?
All that time she was talking to somebody about her mother, she never told you?
She thinks it was Mona.
Ali is scared.
She's trying to be brave but I can see something running around inside her, behind her eyes.
Is there anything running around behind your eyes?
Oh, yeah, snakes, spiders, flying monkeys... nothing I can't handle.
Even if we figure this out, no one is gonna believe us.
I wouldn't believe the story that's happening to me.
That's the only promise I want you to make.
I want you to get on a plane or a boat and go somewhere where they can't find you.
Caleb, I can manage as long as you're safe.
Well, I'm not gonna do that.
Well, that's what I want you to do.
Promise me.
Mona is dead, so who is the lawyer talking to?
I mean, he had to be getting his instructions from someone.
Are you getting this?
Like the rice dish?
Piaf, Edith Piaf.
We have to get back to Mona's room.
Hanna, you spent more time in that room than any of us, so try to think about places that Mona would have hid stuff.
But she wasn't at the trial.
It's got to be hard to hear people talk about your dead daughter.
Should we go see Mona's mom?
I'll go do it.
Well, I'm the least intimidating.
I should have put Hanna in a car and taken off when I had the chance.
You guys are like a band of Vikings.
Well, less pillaging, better hygiene.
She told me to get out before it got too late.
She said it to me but I think that she meant it for all of us.
Do you have any idea how hard that must have been for her to say that to you?
The point is she said it.
Are you thinking about it?
No.
"Essence of best boyfriend," we're gonna make a fortune.
Have you talked to Toby since you got back?
It's not really a good idea under the circumstances.
Finish your cookie.
No answer.
Do you really think there's something up there, or are we just chasing smoke?
So if she knew what might happen, she could have left us a clue.
If, might, could.
That's all we've got.
Well, what if it's not enough?
We're running out of time, we're all gonna get dragged down the rabbit hole with Ali.
Do you want to just give up and go shopping?
Not just yet.
That's okay.
Still a pretty clear path through there between our houses.
Yeah, well there's been a lot of traffic over the years.
Guess that's how you knew she'd come this way when she ran.
Is that how you trapped her for the police?
Maybe you thought there was a chance she was telling the truth.
That's a funny thing for you to say.
Jason, I made a terrible mistake.
No, I made the mistake, Spencer.
I listened to you.
I don't think this is gonna come as any surprise to you, but I can be really certain about things.
Not a surprise.
And there's somebody out there who knows that about me, and they're doing a very good job of using it against me.
Nobody likes the grey places.
I don't think Alison killed anybody.
Where do you think you're going?
Mom, I'm going to Alison's trial.
I forbid it.
Spencer, please, don't go.
If they see you there...
And being afraid isn't going to make things better.
Is this the video the police showed you?
I said that she wasn't with us.
Why have you decided to tell the truth about Alison's alibi?
I don't know.
Was it because of something you saw on the video?
I don't think so.
Didn't you tell Detective Tanner that you thought the attacker in the video was Alison?
I might have said that, yes, but I don't believe that now.
You told police...
I've been thinking and I'm sure that couldn't have been Alison.
Mr. DiLaurentis... do you know a girl named Hanna Marin?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
Do you know Hanna Marin?
Yes.
Is Mrs. Marin in the courtroom today?
Yes.
Point her out to the jury, please.
Does Mrs. Marin work for you?
She did, she doesn't anymore.
Did you have occasion to meet with her outside of the office?
Most of them.
Sorry, I don't think I understand the question.
Well, would you describe them as intimate?
They were private.
Did anything happen during these private meetings with the attractive woman seated in the gallery that led you to alter your testimony?
Objection.
Improper, inflammatory, irrelevant.
Nothing further.
Do you think Hanna knew about this?
Well, what happened in there hurt Ali, didn't it?
Until Hanna's mom convinced him to change his story.
Ask me after I find a place to sleep tonight.
No, you're right.
I'll figure something out.
Cross your fingers and wish hard that you never have to sit in that chair.
You won't like it.
What did he say?
The truth will set you free but first it turns you inside out.
Well, you were right.
I shouldn't have gone to the trial.
I don't think it would have made much of a difference if you'd stayed away.
You might as well start answering that.
It can keep.
You're gonna have to talk to someone sooner or later.
If they haven't heard already, they're going to hear it on the news.
Most of the ladies in the congregation manage to pull the news straight out of the atmosphere.
It's really amazing.
You can go, Ted.
I just want to finish my coffee first.
No, I mean... you can go.
It's all right.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not being noble, I'm being practical.
I made a promise to you.
We can get through this.
We are who we are, Ted.
I never asked you to explain.
You should have.
What's the point of forgiveness if you don't know what really happened?
It's about a clean slate.
There is no such thing.
I'm beginning to think that's the way it was supposed to be.
I'll just finish my coffee.
Do you think she's in there?
Okay, she's not here, she wasn't at the trial, where is she?
Okay, it was a long shot.
Long shots are all we have.
We should try and get to Hanna.
Well, it was a good idea.
"Finders keepers, losers weepers."
Wait.
Why do we think that "A" found something just because "A" said so?
If I were Mona...
What the hell is a chandelier ritual?
I have no idea.
Let me change, I think better in lower heels.
And it wasn't the way I want to see you look at me... ever.
Well, it sounded like she deserved what happened to her, and I don't believe that.
I guess I surprised your face again, huh?
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time.
I mean, maybe I'll write a book or something.
I just hope you didn't get the bad decision gene from me.
Well, I hope I did.
I hope I got all of your DNA in me.
That means I'll be smart and I'll be brave and I'll sing my daughter the best lullabies when she's scared.
Do you know how much I love you?
Yeah, I think I do.
We're quite the pair.
All lying is a one way street.
What does your lawyer think?
She remains confident, except when she doesn't know that I'm looking at her.
Just leave, Jason.
I believe you, Ali.
No.
But I let a lot of things happen that I shouldn't have.
I took money from my mom's purse and she thought it was my brother and that's who got punished.
This was 20, 25 years ago.
Oh, I hate my boobs, they're like a complete joke.
Alison DiLaurentis planned and carried out the murder of Mona Vanderwaal.
Getting a little tired of memorializing Mona.
Are you saying that the world's better off without her?
Have you reached a verdict?
Guilty of murder in the first degree.
They chose to help the wrong person.
I didn't think I could feel worse after "A" killed Mona.
But the four of us getting arrested for her murder brings low to a whole new level.
Technically, they think that we're accessories, not killers.
Why do you think they're separating us from Ali?
Yesterday she told me that the warden received an anonymous tip.
They think the five of us are plotting something big.
What, and they think Ali's the big bad wolf?
When we get there, they're probably going to split us up, too.
What's it like, Han?
Do you want me to sugarcoat it or tell you the truth?
The second they slam that door shut, you feel ashamed.
They treat you like a criminal, and it's hard to remember that you're not one.
The first night's the hardest.
You're locked away from everything and everyone you ever cared about.
And when they turn those lights out, it is the loneliest feeling you could ever imagine.
Second thought, I could have used a thick coat of sugar.
You can't be ready for how it feels, Em.
It's hard not to give up on hope.
You guys, they can take everything from us, but they can't take us from each other.
I don't care how far apart from you guys I am, I will still be with you.
We just had an accident.
Yeah, I did in my pants.
We think the transport officers were neutralized with an injection of flunitrazepam.
The date rape drug?
The deputies regained consciousness this morning with no memory of the incident.
Yeah, but who would want to take the girls?
Should we be asking who would or who could?
If Mona was alive...
Alison's a master manipulator, but she doesn't have access to what was needed to pull off something this elaborate.
Wait, not even the other girls' parents?
Now Alison may still be locked up, but she has access to people.
We both know what she's capable of.
Can anybody hear me?
Is anybody here?
Please exit your room and follow the lighted pathway.
Is everybody okay?
More like "A's" dollhouse.
Yeah, and we're the dolls.
Please follow the lighted pathway.
Ali, is that you?
Caleb got into the PD's command center.
And if you cross-check the van's GPS system with the PD's system, it goes dead right here.
On Route 30, near the railroad crossing.
That's when "A" hacked into the van's computer system and took remote control of the vehicle.
Okay, so "A" would have needed to be near to keep the van on the road.
The overpass would have given "A" a clear view and also cover from the deputies.
Are there any traffic cameras in the area that you can hack into?
One frame of "A," that's all we need.
I can't believe it's really you.
Now come, sit down.
It's tea time.
Tea time?
Why are you acting like such an imbecile?
Han, it's not like you're gonna gain it all back by eating one cookie.
You know you want one.
We really thought you were dead.
I'm so happy to see you guys.
We're really happy to see you too, Mona.
Do not call me that again.
You know how much I loathe that bitch.
We need to start the game.
What if we don't want to play?
Four chimes means it's game time.
The object of the game is to be ready for your date by acquiring an outfit.
Then you get to open the door and find out who your mystery date is.
Like this.
Wait, that's from the Ice Ball.
There's something for everyone today.
These are invitations to prom.
I think we're playing the game to see who our prom dates will be.
No, I'm not.
You're not here alone anymore.
There are five of us, and one of him, her, it, bitch.
Guys, I can't take it.
It won't stop until you're in your rooms!
It should be coming up.
You can't get to that overpass without passing a camera, right?
What the...
"A" found a way to override the camera.
"A's" mocking us with a damn cartoon.
Are you okay?
I'll go get you some ice for that.
- If I can find the right code, then maybe I can write a program that'll pinpoint the source of the hacker's signal.
That's all we need to prove to Tanner that "A" took control of the van.
Every night the main generator shuts down like clockwork.
It takes exactly 3 minutes for the back-up power to kick in.
I have run for 90 seconds in each direction.
That's the way out, but there's an old silo at the end, and you have to climb up.
But if you go past it, there's a steel door at the end of the hall and it's sealed like a vault.
It's too far to make it back to your room.
What happens if you don't make it back in time?
It leaves you for days without food or water.
It blasts the siren until you'd rather die than listen to it one more second.
On a loop it plays a recording of the people that you've left behind, crying at your funeral.
Is my mom okay?
You know you're Mona.
It wanted me to become Alison.
So that's who I am when it's watching.
I didn't think you were wearing that to make a fashion statement.
Yep, she's Mona.
Your mom never showed up to the courthouse.
We heard that it was all too much for her.
God, Mona, I'm so happy that you're okay.
Is Spencer okay?
You can drop the whole caring friend act.
We know exactly who and what you are.
I've done some bad things, Mr. Hastings, but like it or not, I am Spencer's friend.
You forced our daughter to lie for you.
Now she's in as much trouble as you are.
Do you know where she is?
What happened?
Their van never made it to the penitentiary.
I don't know where they are.
But I do know who took them.
We're listening.
It's "A."
But it all started again when she was locked up in Radley.
It was the same game, but with a new puppet master.
And the stakes were higher than ever.
Hanna tried, but there wasn't any proof.
Mona was sick.
We know that that's why she wanted to hurt the girls.
Why be honest now?
I'm going to spend the rest of my life in here.
I don't have anything else to lose.
But you do.
It has a name.
For me?
Would you like me to put it on?
You put a lot of work into this theory.
It's not a theory, it's the facts.
Take a look.
These reports do prove that someone cyber-jacked that vehicle.
And I'm betting that it is Caleb Rivers.
I think he knows where his girlfriend is.
You guys, the blocks in the playroom spelled out a name.
Charles.
Please find your stations.
"Aria Montgomery, music committee."
"Emily Fields and Spencer Hastings, decorating committee."
"Alison DiLaurentis, prom queen election committee."
All these songs are from like 7 years ago.
So "A's" recreating a prom we already had?
Well, if I'm on the election committee, you can be sure I'll win that crown.
Sort of like old times, huh, Spencer?
Remember when I rigged the election for you to win class president?
Want to fill some of these out?
I'll help you if you help me.
If "A" doesn't mind, maybe we can all help each other, starting with these ballots.
We know about "A."
Are you okay?
Maybe that's part of our punishment, to put together the lamest prom ever.
You know, this space is actually pretty awesome.
I'm surprised "A" doesn't have the imagination to see it.
It's a big, ugly room.
We think Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard.
All right, we could rig a bunch of cameras to go off on a timer as you walk down those steps.
It'd be so easy to take all these copper pipes and use them for drapery rods.
And we could use old pipes and make beautiful candelabras.
And we could hang wire from the ceiling and hang shapes to create some beautiful shadows and silhouettes.
That would be A Night At The Opera.
We need to tell the other girls' parents what we know.
Agreed, but we were hoping to have some more answers before we do that.
I don't understand why you can't take this information to the police.
Everything we give Tanner she twists to fit her own theory.
Then let's take our case to the media.
Mr. Hastings, with what we know about "A," that is just not the right move.
What do you know about "A?"
Everything's in those boxes.
And about a dozen more in a storage unit up on the North Highway.
How did we not see this happening again?
And if you decide to open them, you need to be prepared for those to come out.
No more secrets.
They're here for me.
And you're harboring a fugitive.
You can't be here when they find him.
He's doing the right thing.
And we need you on the right side of this, and your boss.
It's Melissa.
Melissa... there's something you need to know.
I think after the prom, she's the only one he wants to keep.
I know what you're thinking, Spencer, but I promise you don't have time to make it to that vault.
So have you ever built one?
I haven't needed to build one.
The stuff Spencer said she needed to decorate.
Long enough to get us out of here.
Yeah, we can turn off the power, but what about "A?"
This is not what I was expecting.
We can use this to make a curtain for Ali's grand entrance.
Why are you making this so easy for "A"?
You know what?
- Stop, this is already stressful enough as it is.
You even quit Maya.
Stop it!
I'm sorry, Spence.
Look, I'm just trying to make the best of a very bad situation.
Then we can all decorate together.
So let's quit wasting time.
You need to charge our client or release him.
You might not know exactly where they are, but you know more than what you're telling me.
Okay, son, I think it's time we go.
I hacked into your computer system, and I found the location where you lost the van.
You just admitted to a federal offense.
I think he meant to say if he hacked into your system he could find the van.
And if he had further access to that system, he may be able to...
Override the hacker's jamming signal and locate the van.
Those are some big "ifs."
I think the bigger "ifs" are what if you're wrong?
What if someone did take the girls?
And because you haven't considered it, you and your analysts are looking in all the wrong places.
Haven't you asked yourself how four teenagers could be this good at evading the police?
You're not going to find the answer investigating the girls because they're not running from you.
There's no way that Hanna wouldn't call me if she could.
Aria, since you're the photographer, you should take the pictures.
Yeah, just save it for tonight though, 'cause there's only one first picture.
Please follow the lighted pathway and return to your rooms.
We got this.
Sometimes a hacker leaves a trail intentionally coded to cover their tracks.
It's smoke and mirrors put there to distract you while they're actually...
The thing about coming in through the back door is the view is entirely different.
40.0508 North, 75.4044 West.
Are you sure about this?
Like I said, that's where the van is.
Call it in, Cavanaugh.
We got a possible location on the missing van.
"A" thought of everything.
Clear!
Fan out and search the perimeter.
Where is Mona?
I don't think she's here yet.
I guess that means we're supposed to dance.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your prom queen...
Charles... we have something for you.
You should be standing up here, Charles.
It's what you want, isn't it?
Wait for it.
Now!
This is the old Campbell Farm.
We used to bring the girls here to go apple picking.
Lieutenant, over here.
What did you find?
What is this place?
It's "A's" lair.
If this is your vault, then these are the things you treasure the most.
You want to say good night to your sister and give her a little kiss?
What a good boy you are.
Oh, good boys, good boys.
Is that you, Charles?
This is not at all what I thought it would be.
"A" has a soul.
And this is not your house, okay?
You're not here alone anymore.
There are five of us and one of him, her, it, bitch.
For God's sakes, Mona, let's go!
We're still trapped.
I know what you've been going through.
Stefan set me up to die, which resulted in days of torture.
That's when I started plotting my revenge.
I'm going to make her do things she'd never dream of doing until she begs me to make her a vampire.
I don't know if you remember this, but Liz and I are pretty close.
I need you to promise me something.
When I'm gone, Caroline is gonna need you to help her move on with her life.
Promise me that you will do that, Stefan.
I promise.
Hey, Tony, I'm headed home for the night.
Could you do me a favor and check up on the Lockwood place?
Carol called again, another 5-Martini stalker sighting, oh, and some teenagers are planning a bonfire off route 13.
No one's called to complain yet, but they will.
I'll be right there.
Hey, what happened?
Accident up at Wickery bridge.
Driver lost control, careened off into the water.
- Any other casualties?
Who are the casualties?
- What's wrong with it?
Extracurricular activities, health and fitness, that sort of thing.
I mean, did you see how scrawny he used to be?
No, but I do recall the 4 months where he faked his own death.
Funny thing about that, he actually didn't fake it.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.
So can we try this my way now?
This small-town atmosphere doesn't nurture a creative spirit like Jeremy Gilbert, and it's of your opinion that it's high time for him to get the hell out of Mystic Falls.
To Matt's phone, which is clearly more important than my last day in town.
Nothing you need to worry about.
Actually, it can't.
What the hell does that...
I take it from your abrupt pause that you either had a small stroke or Sarah walked in.
It's good news either way.
Make her feel welcome, oh, and don't go blabbing details of our little arrangement around the party.
He needed someone to take pictures for the website, and he said you mentioned me.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna get a drink.
- She ok?
- She will be.
We all will.
Somehow, we'll all find a way to move on without you, Jeremy.
I jacked a little going-away present from Ric's girlfriend's stash.
Put it away, you idiot.
I'm sure everything around him reminds him of Bonnie, and Elena's always wanted to protect him from vampire drama.
Granted, he is going to art school, where the percentage rate for a well-paying job is one of the lowest in the country, but I really am happy for him.
Do you think you packed enough?
The whole point of this is for my mom to live out the rest of her time here in a relaxed and peaceful environment surrounded by the things that she loves, like photo albums and board games.
All the books that she's never gotten around to reading.
Why are you calling him?
You snuck out of the house this morning witht so much as a hello.
I may be a retired sheriff, but I am still a mother.
What are you up to?
If I told you, it would ruin the surprise.
Master bedroom.
Sweetheart, that's not true.
Mom, I heard you talking to him in hospital.
You asked him to look after me and make me smile and help me move on with my life after you're gone.
I'm sure that's not the only reason he's there.
I will call you in 3 hours with all the details.
Not to be blunt, but I think dying gets you a ticket out of work.
Just saying.
How you feeling?
Like I'm not gonna leave this job with unfinished business.
I have all these open cases.
This one was me.
Me.
Elena's parents.
Didn't know there was an open investigation.
Well, at the time, I was taking care of Elena and Jeremy, and I didn't want to drag them through more heartache.
Then when I was finally ready to reopen the wound, Elena had moved on, and you and I had become friends, and I worried that...
What, that I was involved?
Miranda left me this message two hours before they got in that car, two hours before they drove off that road for no reason.
Please call me back as soon as you can.
I'll be damned.
Looks like you got a good, old-fashioned, sheriffy whodunit on your hands.
You know I'm a vampire, right, a big sister with nearly perfect senses who can sneak up on you without making a sound.
Damon gave it to me, and technically, it's from Ric's girlfriend's stash.
He was worried someone might recognize him when he's supposed to be dead.
Our lives are so weird.
That's the understatement of the century.
Give me your lighter.
- What, really?
Look what I found in the...
I just didn't know my mom kept it.
It used to have these training wheels on the back with lights that would flash every time you pedaled.
Then one day, my mom took them off and said it was time to be a big girl.
You can imagine the princess-sized tantrum that followed.
You know that you don't have to do all this, right?
Not till I finish this.
Ah, suit yourself.
Can I ask you something about that night?
So you both just happened to be in town the night her parents died.
You never talk about her.
Not much to say.
Why do I feel like you're leaving something out?
Something did happen that night.
Let me have your car.
- No way in hell.
And it has to be mine?
Just compel yourself a new one.
Oh, God, how many cars you think we've destroyed?
Like, more than the average family, right?
Dude, just click ignore.
- Don't be stupid.
- I am.
Mom and dad died, and what did I do?
I let you be Jenna's problem because I couldn't deal.
But I never thought that made you a bad sister.
If anything, it was nice to have someone to go through it with.
When you got better, that's when I felt the most alone.
What, Damon?
I'm bonding with my brother.
I want to run something by you.
Is there any chance you can get to the sheriff's office?
So I hear you're leaving town.
Probably smart, considering you tried to kill me and, surprise, I'm still here.
I'll just send these over to my manager.
Anyone ever tell you you're a really good photographer?
Oh, this will come as a shock to you, but I don't care.
There's a tunnel along the river off route 13.
Take her hand, exchange pleasantries, standard introductory behavior.
If you want to meet her, come here.
See, that sounded like you telling me what to do.
Oh, is this the part where you threaten my mom again?
After all, what has your mum ever done to me?
Well, except that one night...
I'm hanging up now.
There's a cellar under the stairs.
You ok?
Do you realize that whichever book my mom reaches for could be the last thing that she ever reads?
"Jane Eyre" is 600 pages.
What if she doesn't finish, or, worse, what if she gets halfway through and then realizes that she hates it?
What if she wastes her final precious moments on a terrible book?
I just don't want to be held responsible for ruining her last literary experience.
I'm opening this.
Honestly, I don't remember why we took that route home, and I had no idea that there was luggage in the trunk.
What about the lack of skid marks?
Any reason your dad would just drive off the road like he was trying to avoid something without braking?
I was texting with Bonnie when it happened.
Embarrassing, I know.
What about the voicemail?
I wasn't home that night.
You really think there's something up with my parents' crash?
I don't know, but given the way this town works, I wouldn't be surprised.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Elena.
I know I should've brought this up sooner, but in those first few weeks after your parents died, I...
I remember.
I'll see if Jeremy knows anything.
Hey, would you rather take more pictures of potato skins?
Apparently, my mom chose today to tackle an entire career worth of cold cases.
Hmm, well, they're gonna have a lot of catching up to do.
So I realize that it doesn't matter.
What doesn't matter?
Doesn't matter what book your mom reads in her final precious moments.
Doesn't matter if it's good or if it's terrible.
I know.
I know that she asked you to look after me.
- Caroline, that's not what...
- I'm ok with it, really.
I'm glad, actually, because I don't know if I would be able to get through this on my own.
I'm not here because your mom asked me to look after you.
- Then why are you here?
- Well, because you're my friend, because I know what it feels like to lose a mother, and because when you told me you hated me, that was pretty much the worst thing I had heard in a long time.
I think we both know I never really hated you.
One of us should probably say something.
I called 911.
You need to get out of here.
What the hell kind of a person just barrels into someone and then drives off like that?
Are you ok?
What happened?
Do you need help?
I was out walking, and I heard you two.
Just help him, please.
Did you just...
I'm gonna kick his ass.
What'd the sheriff want?
She wanted to talk about the night that mom and dad died.
She thinks something else happened, like maybe it wasn't an accident.
What else could we possibly go through?
Mom had called her a couple of hours before the crash.
She said she was gonna have me arrested.
So she called the sheriff.
She was pretending to be all business, but I could hear Jenna giggling outside.
It was the last time we spoke, fighting through a door.
Miranda wanted you to bust Jeremy for smoking pot.
What about the luggage?
There was a storm the day before.
Jeremy's dad was planning a secret trip to their lake house, and the storm rained them out.
Slick roads, no skid marks.
The storm, that was the reason.
Mystery solved.
Would you mind calling Caroline and telling her she can surprise me tomorrow?
I'm not really feeling up to it tonight.
Absolutely.
Just call me if there's any other updates, ok?
Sheriff ok?
Ah, you weren't supposed to hear that.
Damon said that she's getting worse.
I can't leave now, no way, not with the sheriff sick and Enzo on a rampage.
It's not the right time.
No kidding, because the right time was a couple of years ago.
Enzo could have killed you today, and the other day, Liv threw you across a room, and let's not forget the time that you actually died.
She's right.
Time to get the hell out of here.
You deserve a normal life, Jer.
You deserve the life of a kid whose only baggage is that he lost his parents.
Actually, why don't you let me take him?
You should go be with Liz.
Oh, I do not have the energy to tell you how deeply that disturbs me.
You wanted more today, didn't you, about the accident?
I did everything right, Damon.
It just...
I have to admit, there is a certain amount of peace knowing I'll be one of the only people in Mystic Falls to die an ordinary death.
I'm exceptionally ordinary.
I'm ok with that.
- For what?
For today, for being here.
You know, I didn't get a chance to spend much time with my mom before she died.
You want a second chance?
Want rocks, or you want neat?
Where is she?
Elizabeth Forbes, what room's she in?
They said they can make her comfortable.
I didn't get to say good-bye.
I didn't get to say good-bye to my mom.
Tyler, hey, it's Stefan.
You might want to head back to Mystic Falls.
What'd the doctors say?
Oh, she's stable, but, you know.
How much longer?
Not long.
The hospital says she has a DNR, so...
I'm gonna get some air.
I should have been with her.
You didn't know.
But I knew she was sick, and I knew it was bad.
I was supposed to give her peace and convince her that I would be ok and thank her for being an amazing mom.
God, I don't ever remember the last thing that I said to her.
I was supposed to be with her in her final moment.
You still can.
This is where you're headed.
The bus will take you to a town about 30 miles north of Santa Fe.
You know, a responsible guardian would try and stop you...
So might as well pursue it.
Just don't do anything stupid, ok?
You already went over this.
No one needs to worry about me, ok?
I'm proud of you, Jeremy.
Think about your favorite memory of your mom.
We can do that?
Just take her hand.
I want to stop.
If you stop, you'll never learn, sweetie.
I don't want to learn.
Yes, you do.
I can't do it.
Just pedal.
I'm gonna fall off.
I want my other wheels back on.
It's working.
Don't let go, mommy.
I won't, not till you're ready.
Yes, you are.
You can hear me, right?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thanks, Peter.
Your... your news is a gift to us, Kris, you too, Matthew.
Looks like the whole town's out.
I wonder what's going on.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
So anyway, as I was saying, the monument comes out of the foundry next week and will be ready for installation.
Jack, you made your thoughts very clear when we first discussed this.
Can we move on?
If you think this is so ridiculous, why do you bother coming to these meetings?
Well, I come to these meetings, Kris, because they do me a lot of good, believe it or not, like you, and maybe one day, life will give me a beautiful gift too.
Don't get mad at me.
It's not my fault.
I know you were probably worried.
I would have called you, but I lost my phone.
Please don't look at me like that.
I woke up in the mountains, way up above the dam.
Took me, like, two hours to walk home.
Yeah.
She's at a friend's.
I'll clean up later, okay?
Just pretty good?
You do set the bar kind of high.
Don't smoke in here.
I own the place.
So, can I see you on Thursday?
So you need cash?
You've been so awesome to me, Jack.
My ex is such an asshole.
He's postponing the custody hearing again because he knows I can't afford to keep paying for these depositions.
I'll bring a check.
How about Wednesday?
Let me check my schedule.
Yeah, that works.
I need you to come over here right now.
Come over.
Hey, Lena, your dad's seeing Lucy again.
Can you bring me my bathrobe, please?
Thank you.
Come on in.
What's wrong?
Camille is here.
You want to see her?
Now listen.
Lena?
No, it's me.
What are you doing?
Dad!
She doesn't remember anything...
It's just not possible.
No, it's not, but you just saw her.
But there has to be some other explanation.
Like what?
Both going crazy at the same time?
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?
Since when are you smoking again?
Did Mom tell you what happened to me today?
It's kind of weird, isn't it?
It's like a coma or a neurological thing.
You guys are acting very weird.
Hey, Pilar.
Dr. Han.
Working late?
Isn't that supposed to be over at, like, 8:00?
Where are your parents?
Are you lost?
What's your name?
Here, come inside.
What's his name?
Victor.
If you don't talk to me, I'm gonna call the police.
Okay, I'm dialing.
Everything's fine.
You can stay here tonight, but tomorrow, I'm taking you to the police.
- Claire?
- In here.
What, um... what's going on?
Camille has come back.
Do you want to see her?
She's in her room.
Come and see.
What are all these photos of me and candles doing in my drawer?
Camille, this is Peter.
He's a psychologist.
I thought he could talk to you.
Hello, Camille.
You called a psychologist?
Actually, I'm a friend of your mother's.
Sure.
So, Camille, do you remember anything after the bus accident?
I was in an accident?
Well, sometimes when something traumatic happens, our brain blocks it out as a defense mechanism, as a way of protecting ourselves.
The memories usually return once we're more equipped to deal with them.
So the bus crashed, and now I have amnesia?
It's more complicated than that.
What's happened to you is extraordinary and wonderful.
I need to go to sleep now.
Of course.
Come here, honey, hop in bed.
Just close your eyes, relax.
Love you.
I love you too.
Hey, Lucy, it's me.
I really need to talk to you.
Just... can you just call me back?
How do you explain this?
Camille is back.
Why are you trying to ruin this?
- Don't know her.
- She's a waitress here.
I don't think so.
Yeah, she is.
If a Rowan worked here, I think I would know.
I know Rowan.
I know where she lives.
Hello?
Hello?
Why are you walking so fast?
How come I've never seen you at the Dog Star before?
- Explain that.
How long have you lived in Caldwell?
How do you know Rowan?
You're welcome, asshole.
I know you're in there.
Are you okay, Mommy?
Yeah, sweetie.
What's the matter?
It started happening again.
I thought it was over.
Don't worry.
No TV.
It's time to go to sleep.
Please, at least tell me your real name.
Victor.
I just had to work a double shift.
I need you to talk to Camille.
I need you to ask why she's here.
She's here for Claire.
She's going back to the other side, but she's sending all of you her love.
When she came home, what kind of sandwich did she have?
How does somebody do something like that?
I really don't see why I have to go on this stupid trip.
Actually, I don't feel that well either.
You feel fine.
You're gonna have fun, I promise.
I hope I do.
Hey there.
I take it you're feeling better?
Much.
You don't want to?
Is it Camille?
Because we both like you.
Well, I'm sort of in love with you, so is that fair to me?
This is due Monday.
You can hear me, right?
Yes.
Thank you.
It's not my fault.
Something really weird happened.
I woke up in the mountains, way up above the dam.
What are you doing?
Get out!
- I don't think so.
That song was written by our guitar player, Simon, and he's gonna kick my ass for telling you all this right now, but he wrote it about a very sweet, very hot waitress he had a thing for.
To Rowan, Simon, may you live happily ever after.
Congratulations.
That's okay.
You want me to show you?
I thought that was only in your dress.
We barely slept.
Is that my fault?
You started it.
What?
Later.
I'm pregnant.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Are you happy?
Maybe you'd be more comfortable waiting in the office?
He's coming.
He's always late.
No, he's coming.
Um, we were gonna write our own.
I haven't gotten around to mine yet.
It doesn't have to be Shakespeare or scripture.
I can give you a few templates, help get you started.
Yeah, that'd be great.
I got to pee.
Ladies' room is right down that hall.
And how are you two doing?
Are you kidding?
I've been trying to get her to marry me since, what, our second date?
I'm excited.
Excuse me.
She was stabbed, multiple times.
I'm on my way.
Give me a kiss.
Now get out of here.
Call you later.
I understand.
Be careful.
Can I help you?
It was late, and he looked like he might have been lost.
Did you ask him if he was lost?
I was driving, so I just saw him.
Sorry, I didn't know you were in here.
I died, didn't I?
I'm afraid of myself.
I'm gonna use the other bathroom.
Would you guys please stop looking at me like that?
You're freaking me out.
So this is what you're gonna do, just act like everything's normal?
No, obviously nothing is normal, but we still have to eat breakfast.
So, please, sit.
What is he doing here?
Did he stay the night?
Why?
You know why.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're being ridiculous for believing that there's any way that this could be Camille.
Who the hell else would I be?
Why am I the only one in this family living in reality?
Act like she's the baby Jesus?
Want to keep your voice down, please?
You think you can hide her?
Why bother?
Stop it.
Gonna hit me again?
Now you're gonna talk to me.
I just got back from the police station.
Why isn't anybody looking for you?
Did you run away from home?
Did somebody hurt you?
Where are you from?
Do you understand English?
Victor, why won't you talk to me?
What happened to Simon was a terrible tragedy.
I know how much you've struggled.
Revisiting all those feelings must be very difficult, but it's going to be different this time.
You and Tommy are going to share a long, happy life together.
How could you possibly know that?
God only gives us what we can handle.
Apparently God thinks I'm Noah and Job combined.
Let me ask you something.
Do you want to get married?
Of course.
But then a part of me is just...
He deserves better.
Why do you feel that way?
It felt so real.
Rowan, it's perfectly reasonable for you to be thinking of Simon so close to your wedding day.
It's very important to make peace with our ghosts.
Do you know where I can find Rowan Blackshaw?
She used to be a waitress here.
The library?
Hey, asshole.
That was a real gentleman move.
You could at least say you're sorry.
I'm sorry.
Did you find Rowan?
What are you doing here this time of the day?
Don't you have a job or something?
Why do you look so familiar?
You can figure it out while I go to the bathroom.
Hi, Julie.
Hi, Annie.
Hey, little guy.
You're just cuteness on a stick.
Yeah, he's my nephew.
How long is he staying?
I'm not sure.
So terrible about Mr. Goddard, isn't it?
What do you mean?
You haven't heard?
Suicide.
He jumped off the dam.
Was there something wrong with him?
Was it cancer?
He didn't leave a note, so everybody's wondering.
Okay, we got to go.
Sorry to give you the bad news.
We didn't really know her that well.
I mean, none of us talked to her that much.
Hey, there was this guy here earlier.
Anyway, if that guy comes around again, just give me a call.
Will do.
Good luck.
We just need you to come down to the station, answer a few questions.
About Lucy?
Yeah, about Lucy.
Well, what did you do?
Can anyone corroborate that?
Seven years ago, October 31st, at 1:00 a.m., witnesses spotted your truck running a red light two blocks away from the scene of an attempted homicide.
A woman was stabbed several times in the stomach.
There were bite marks.
It was a miracle she survived.
I told you a thousand times, I did not hurt that woman.
Jen Rodriguez?
And now Lucy McCabe?
That's impossible.
- That's enough, Banks.
You can step out.
Something that could help us put this guy away.
Am I right, Tony?
Is there something you want to tell me?
I don't think she even understands we've separated.
And now you're hoping to work things out with Jack, now that Camille's back.
A week ago, I would have said it was impossible.
It's not just about us anymore.
I understand.
I hope you do.
Profound loss changes you.
For better or worse, you and Jack aren't the same people you were before Camille's accident.
Is that your professional opinion?
That is the opinion of someone who cares about you...
And who doesn't want to lose you.
I couldn't have gotten through the last four years without you.
Hello, Doctor.
Manage to get some sleep?
Not a wink.
So I guess you know I'm a zombie.
You're a miracle.
I was at your funeral.
I saw you in the casket.
So all the other kids on the bus died?
Then why am I here?
That's for you to find out.
God, you were so handsome.
I want you to know that just because I'm marrying Tommy, it doesn't mean I'm ever going to stop loving you.
You're always gonna be a part of my heart, a part of my life.
I tried to forget you.
But the truth is, I don't want to.
I don't want to let you go.
I know you don't really exist, but that doesn't scare me anymore.
I'm glad you've come back.
Call me if you need anything.
I'm sorry.
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
She'd torn up Lena's room, and she was gone.
Okay, did you call Lena?
Yeah, she's not answering.
Hey, that's not gonna happen.
Damn it, did you come straight from the bar?
Well, let's take my car.
I don't think it's a good idea for you to be driving right now.
Want a drink?
Tony won't ID you if, you know, you're with me.
Have fun out here.
Honey, are you okay?
I saw Hunter.
He didn't even recognize me.
Sweetie.
I'm sorry.
You and Hunter weren't that close, were you?
We were in the same class.
Forgot about me.
That is not true.
So, Mr. Moran, we've got a problem.
According to our records, you're supposed to have died six years ago.
Want to explain how that works?
You're the cops.
Do you know Rowan Blackshaw?
Why are you asking me that?
Because Simon Moran was her boyfriend.
Fiancé.
Yeah, who died, six years ago.
Why are you asking me about Rowan?
Lock him up.
For what?
Where have you been?
What?
What did you do to my room?
How's Ben?
You guys hang out a lot?
Get some sleep, okay?
Are you afraid of the dark?
Good night.
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...
Katrina has chosen to side with the enemy.
Lieutenant!
The Traveler Spell, it worked.
Clearly, she's touched.
Put her in shackles so she causes no harm.
Rifle!
Make certain 37th receives these supplies.
Front moves north in an hour.
This battle's far from over.
Raise your hand.
She seemed to know that, Captain.
Said it was about your mission... a Hessian soldier with a bow on his hand.
You address me as if we've met.
No, sir, we haven't met, yet.
Speak plainly, madam.
Look, I have very reliable information.
Captain, they're calling for your return.
I'm telling you I know things.
I heard he was mortally wounded.
Katrina, your husband isn't here.
No, ma'am, Captain Crane was called away.
How?
A mysterious slave woman, claiming to have enemy secrets.
This woman, did she mention her name?
Do you know where they are now?
They never returned.
She saved him from the worst of it we've seen.
This Hessian, he was like something from hell.
Alcohol is a disinfectant.
It'll do him more good on the outside.
That's impossible.
Their weapons must have been heated.
You believe one man did all this?
Miss Mills, precisely what is it you're after?
General Washington has put his trust in you.
He told you this revolution isn't just a war about the future of this country.
It'll determine the fate of every man, woman and child.
Now we have another problem.
You were... you were saved, suspended in time, until we met, but now everything... the fate of the country, the fate of the mission that Washington assigned you, the fate of our mission together... future is off the rails.
Who are you?
You had no grounds to abandon your post.
What will become of her?
Colonel, that is not what I meant.
She knew of the Hessian attack.
In my estimation, she is, or was, a British agent.
What do you suggest?
I need every man on the field.
It could save us another loss, which we cannot afford.
And at the very least, provide some answers about today.
Your Oxford degree and connections are not going to save you next time.
Deserters face a firing squad.
Never realized riding in a carriage would be so uncomfortable.
Thank you.
It's three miles to the encampment.
Well, uh, Katrina inspired you to abandon your allegiance with the Crown.
But when Abraham Van Brunt couldn't pick out the right engagement necklace for her, you did.
Is this the story His Majesty's spies have on record?
We take on the impossible and... we figure a way out.
And we turn to... we turn to books.
Recently returned from France.
To Mr. Franklin!
Brace yourself.
I know it is you under that mask, Abraham.
I know why you are here.
You are searching for the same man as I.
He has joined with another woman and together they're a formidable foe to us both.
So they both must die.
I suppose there are flying carriages in the second millennia.
Only for long distances.
I was being sarcastic.
That's gonna be a Starbucks.
A what?
Coffee house.
That livery stable, too.
- Why?
Afternoon.
You know them?
'Tis a small town.
They've never seen a woman in trousers.
I was headed to Quantico.
I cannot promise Mr. Franklin's response.
But if he does not receive us well, they shall lock us both up.
But what of my other ideas?
Hospitals?
The post office?
We're standing in front of a woman who's two centuries ahead of us.
A sheriff's detective.
An officer of the law.
Ichabod, everything we're striving for here, fighting with our dying breath to create for this country a free land of opportunity for all Miss Abigail Mills represents.
She is the American dream.
Even evil feared the repercussions of time travel and dared not attempt it.
Miss Mills claims a woman is here to kill me, and that our fates are entwined with that of the entire war.
The Grand Grimoire cannot heal her guilt.
It can only cause more destruction.
This complicates things.
We must reverse the Traveler Spell, which, essentially, will undo everything that's happened since you and Katrina arrived.
How?
Specifics elude my grasp, but it's my understanding, for a brief period, all spells can be undone.
But time is short.
Where to?
Ah, but this is the past.
How many people know about this secret war?
There are levels.
We're going to Fredericks Manor.
That... makes perfect sense.
Everybody down!
We have to get back to Fredericks Manor and reverse it.
You heard what Franklin said.
Our union with France is in jeopardy, the rules he was authoring to govern this land remain unfinished.
And you schemed, you played upon my friendship with Franklin, upon his predilection for the supernatural, and you led a Hessian assassin to his very doorstep.
- Nonsense!
- You have to believe you are that crucial to this war.
The Horseman is pursuing us because you and I are the only ones who can fix this.
But since the fate of the world depends on you believing me...
The Horseman's ally, the witch... is your wife Katrina.
Crane!
I do not understand.
You had a direct order to transport her to the encampment.
I was acting under promising information that she gave.
And you took her to Benjamin Franklin.
However, I do not believe she is a spy.
You have been relieved of duty.
What are you doing here?
You startled me.
I've had a wretched day.
And where is she now?
She is due any day now.
I hope that does not disappoint you.
Still, how might I find this poor madwoman?
Captain Crane.
I will return.
Ride ahead of me.
There's someone I must visit first.
Keep what you fancy.
Has Sutton transferred her?
The password is... my birthday.
What devilry is this?
I fail to understand why you can't simply take this picture.
The narcissism of your generation never ceases to astound.
Miss Mills.
As if posterity requires me to document that this morning I... ate a plate of waffles.
One of the greatest minds in the colonies has died, and you are going to answer for it.
Of the same sort you had for Captain Crane?
Save your breath for after you have tasted America's true strength.
That's a relief.
I didn't want to believe you.
Then I went home to Katrina.
She must be with child.
I'm sure this is all incredibly hard.
I saw a book.
It resembles your description of the Grimoire.
And I thought sh... she could be a... witch.
Something was amiss.
Captain.
It took a long time for you to understand her in the future, if either of us fully do.
There was a time she was good and she loved you.
That Katrina's gone.
The seeds must have been there.
How did I not see it?
We're all blind to what we do and don't want to believe.
Fredericks Manor.
Now, if Grace can undo this, uh, Traveler Spell perhaps we can set things right.
Whatever right is now.
Thank you.
Is this necessary?
It is in order for me to find her.
How are you privy to such information?
Why, it's simple, really.
I'm a witch.
Ah, Captain Crane.
Grace.
It's really you.
Sort of.
So do I. And God do I wish we had more time.
She followed a blood magic practitioner to our time.
Benjamin Franklin said that you would know how to reverse the Traveler Spell.
Then we should commence.
It's guided us, helped us fight evil.
Everything that we do is because of the legacy that you started.
Sometimes all it takes is to put pen to paper to make a difference.
It's the Horseman and Katrina.
You will die out there.
If you succeed, it won't matter.
- It's just that you don't speak to me so formally in the future.
Well, Lieutenant... let us change the course of history... again.
Is this level of intimacy commonplace in 2015?
Mm, yeah.
We hug it out.
Abigail, these are the most important pages of all.
These are the pages you will write.
The most crucial battles still lie ahead.
He's not gonna make it!
There's no time!
Read these words to complete the spell.
You brought us back here.
This is your doing!
Katrina, no!
She killed my son.
She dies.
You had no choice.
Yes, I did.
We all did.
I don't want to die again.
Is it really you?
Henry's death released my soul.
I'm sorry.
So, it's over.
This part is over.
She told me that the most crucial battles are still ahead of us.
This is why we're here.
All of us together.
Whatever's next, we're there for each other.
Ready, Captain?
Ready, Lieutenant.
- Jeff.
Effective immediately, I'm tendering my resignation.
Forstman doesn't throw money around without getting something in return.
He's gonna get money in return.
Where's the proof?
In Eric Woodall's bank accounts.
This is ridiculous.
I'm your boss.
Anyone else ever loses faith in me, it doesn't matter.
With you, it's different.
I should go.
Why?
You know, usually when someone wins their first trial, they at least pretend to finish the drink their fellow ADAs bought them.
I'm sorry, do we--
Know each other?
Because it's the day you get to meet Donna.
Oh, you have no idea how Donna I am.
- Well, Donna, I'm Harvey--
I know about everybody.
What I don't know is why this is the first case you ever took to trial.
You're not just a pretty face, are you?
No, I'm not.
So maybe you should buy me a drink, and we can continue this conversation in the corner.
I thought we were done with you following me.
You need my help, or the SEC needs my help?
I can't find the money.
Forstman buys people, and we handed them to you on a silver platter.
And I stuck my neck out for you, and I accused my friend of being on the take.
Well, what makes you think I can find the money when you couldn't?
I don't know if you can or not, but they're gonna shut me down in five days, and I need all the help I can get.
You want something.
I sure do.
And I think I might be ready to give it to you.
Wow, you're gonna be that honest about it.
Saves time.
Well, in that case, I want to move to your desk.
And why is that?
Because it's no secret that in a few years, you're going back to Gordon, Schmidt, and Van Dyke.
And let me guess, you want to come with me when I do.
Because I'm gonna be an actress, and I want somebody who understands that there's more to life than just the DA's office.
And that I can give my all to them but still step out for the occasional audition.
So you're stepping out on me already?
Macallan 36.
I didn't order a Macallan 36.
It's from the gentleman over there.
Okay, I don't know who that is, but I'm telling you right now, he is bad news.
You look different.
I will take that as a compliment.
Excuse me?
What's he been doing this whole time?
- Yeah, that's what I said.
So where's the right place?
I don't know exactly.
Because I don't know him to know how I know it.
- How do you know it?
Norma's dead.
Oh, Louis, I'm so sorry.
There wasn't a day that went by that I didn't want to rip out one of her varicose veins and strangle her with it.
Okay, I don't think you're in touch with how you're really feeling right now.
How I'm feeling is that she left me high and dry just like she always did.
You expect her to keep working?
Look at this.
It's her entire estate laid out on paper.
She couldn't manage my calendar, but this crap fest she plans within an inch of her life.
And you want me to make sure these things are bequeathed properly?
You can stuff them in a giant piñata for all I care.
I have to go find the perfect urn to throw her ashes off the top of the building.
She requested that?
No, she wanted them to be in here with me, but like hell I'm gonna do that.
Okay, Louis, I will take care of this for you, but you're not throwing her ashes anywhere without me.
No.
Harvey will be just fine on his own.
I know who you are, and I'm not interested.
Just 'cause I got a bad reputation?
Because I'm not accepting a drink for putting your rival behind bars.
You got the wrong idea, pal.
Okay, you got me.
What are you talking about?
And I want people with something special working for me.
Why exactly would I want to work for you?
I can think of a million reasons, 'cause that's the signing bonus I'm gonna give you, and that's a hell of a lot more money than you're ever gonna make as a lawyer.
Then I'd ask you, what do you practice it for?
To bend people to my will.
Then go offer your gardener a job, because I'm not interested.
Just so you know, if you change your mind and come back to me, it's not gonna be the same conversation.
Thanks for the drink.
If Forstman gave the money to someone Woodall's close to, we need to start by compiling a family tree.
I meant why aren't you at school today?
Because I'm gonna prove to Harvey that I exist.
Rachel, he didn't give me that look because he doesn't respect you.
He gave me that look because he's ashamed.
Let's just say that I'm not the only one that Charles Forstman duped.
That's why Harvey's so slow to care about anybody.
Who do you think it was?
I don't know, but I have a pretty good guess.
Well, what do you think?
I think this place is a dump, and I'm busy, so why don't you tell me why we're here?
And it isn't working.
Which is why they're gonna lose their lease.
You're the big-time lawyer who just got his name in the paper.
My name in the paper doesn't pay me extra money.
I make $50,000 a year.
And you said you were gonna be a corporate lawyer.
I give a shit about when you were supposed to be my big brother, but instead, what did you do?
I know what I did.
Then you know I can never get a loan for as long as I live.
Marcus, when are you gonna take responsibility for your own shit?
What the hell does it look like I'm trying to do?
And you're not taking a nickel from that man.
Taking his money isn't gonna make what he did to Dad any worse.
That's bullshit, and you know it, and I'm not gonna let you do it.
Am I crazy, or is that the same dress you were wearing the last time I saw you?
You must be crazy, because I don't wear the same dress ever.
Then you must spend a fortune on wardrobe.
But I have to say, it's worth it.
I suddenly get the feeling this isn't just a drop-by.
I want to move up our timeline.
Harvey, we have a deal.
I put myself on the line for you, and our deal is not going to change.
How much money did Marcus lose this time?
He doesn't want to start shit.
He owes somebody something.
What I know is, you're either gonna help me or Charles Forstman is.
It's up to you.
Harvey, I can't make you listen to me, but what I'm not going to do is let you come here and leverage me with some bullshit offer from a shady banker, so do what you're gonna do.
You can buy all the Wonder Bread you want, Eric, but you can't take it with you to prison.
What are you doing here?
I'm here to remind you that once they find the money, it's all gonna come tumbling down.
Well, they're not gonna find the money, 'cause there is no money.
Not in your accounts, but I know what Cahill doesn't.
Forstman gave it to somebody you care about, and if I tell him that, it'll be too late.
We both know you're not dumb enough to do that.
I'm here to get you to cut a deal and turn Forstman in.
You don't have the authority to cut a deal.
No, but I can get Cahill to after you hire me to represent you.
You mean hire the fox to watch the henhouse?
So why don't you take my card?
This is ridiculous.
Woodall's got 30 people it could be, or it could be none of them.
I know that, but this is our job.
No, our job is to help Harvey get Forstman.
No, he just doesn't need me to tell him about it.
And I just told you, he doesn't want to hear it.
And when has that ever stopped you before?
- This is different.
Then we're both telling him.
Harvey, Norma passed away.
- That's not what I meant.
- But it is what you said.
I'm not gonna acknowledge it because nothing happened last night.
Because it would have been a mistake, and you know it.
What I know is something happened, and you ran away, but not before you told me you loved me.
I did that because I wanted to make you feel better.
Love me how?
- Why does that have to--
That's what I thought.
You either can't answer or you won't, which is bullshit, because obviously, you don't just look at me this way.
You're capable of looking at me that way, but you don't want to let those worlds collide because you're afraid to risk anything.
Because we have everything.
Nobody finds out where I live.
Now, you want to tell me what changed your mind?
Let's have it.
Okay, you want it?
Here it is.
So you might as well leave right now.
- I didn't say I had a problem.
- I think maybe you do.
When you always win, it's not a problem.
I think I might like you, pal.
Okay, I think maybe we're gonna need another minute.
You are lucky that I don't take this mockery of a final resting place and shove it up your ass.
Oh, please don't give me that touchy-feely shit.
And why the hell are you not being bad cop?
Louis, I'm not Norma.
She's gone... and it's gonna be okay.
She was a battle-ax!
But she was my battle-ax.
I'm so sorry.
Both of you?
We've spent two of our five days on it, and we still don't have a name, so we think it's time to consider--
Which means we both want to help.
You think I haven't wondered how to go after Forstman 100 times in the last dozen years?
Then why don't you?
Harvey, I'm not saying--
This is Charles Forstman.
- There is no other way out.
Well, that was a bust.
Yeah, and you also told me he needed to hear things that he didn't want to hear.
Okay, well, now all he heard is, not only can't he trust me, he can't trust you either.
I'm not questioning it.
I'm the closest person in the world to you, and I wouldn't be on your family tree.
I'm being serious.
We've exhausted every person that's related to him.
Maybe it's time we found someone who isn't.
Now I really don't understand why Harvey doesn't respect you.
Too soon.
I can have any one?
I get to drive a badass car, and I get to kick your ass.
Take, for instance, what's-his-name--DuPont?
The point is, after what you did the other day, why aren't you leading that?
Because this is Cameron's case.
If I were him, it'd be yours.
Harvey, you are his star player, and he's not even putting you in the game.
And on top of that, he didn't have the balls to announce whether he's going after DuPont or not.
Don't you worry about Cameron Dennis.
DuPont's gonna get what's coming to him.
What are you talking about?
Well, you're loyal to the guy you work for.
I like that.
So you were just talking shit about him to see if I'd jump on board?
And you didn't... which is why we don't have to race anymore.
Well, that's all well and good, Charles, but we're still racing.
Don't give me that shit.
Did you confront Eric Woodall yesterday morning at his supermarket?
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.
Did you approach the subject of an SEC investigation with the express purpose of intimidating him?
I approached him with the express purpose of hiring me as his lawyer.
And instead, he's claiming that I sent you there to intimidate him.
He's either gonna buy what I'm selling or cover his tracks.
And if he covers his tracks, you need to be there.
Didn't stop you following me.
Enough.
He's filing charges of harassment against me.
We do this, nothing sticks.
Then we might not get him, because I have nothing.
Well, let me give you a little extra motivation.
So if he gets exonerated, who do you think's gonna be the first person he goes after?
So, instead of going to Jersey for your produce, go get me something I can use.
You're having a drink by yourself?
What's going on?
So why don't you tell me why you're here, Harvey?
Cahill's having trouble getting evidence against Forstman and Woodall.
I'm aware of that.
Then you should also be aware that if Woodall keeps his job, he's likely to go after Louis.
I could've done that math, and so could you, so...
I might be able to help them get Forstman... on something else.
Does this have something to do with when he offered you that job 12 years ago?
Yes.
I told you that man was trouble.
And I told you I wouldn't abandon Marcus and you were wrong about him.
So this has something to do with Marcus.
Yes, it does.
Then what are you asking?
I want your help to get my mind right.
So I'm not sure if I can help you get your mind right, 'cause right now... mine's not right.
Hang on a sec.
Does this have something to do with that Forstman guy buying you a drink the other night?
I thought you didn't know who he was.
Well, I looked him up because I thought I was gonna be working for you.
And I'm telling you, he's shady.
Because he's got a bad reputation?
I don't care what his reputation is.
You don't know this about me yet, but I know people... usually better than they know themselves.
You're just trying to get me to stay so you can work at my desk.
You're making a mistake if you take a job with that man.
Then I guess I'm making a mistake, because I already did.
So you're keeping her here after all.
Yeah, I couldn't throw her off the roof after you got me to cry.
I'm glad.
Donna, I can't thank you enough for what you did.
Oh, you're welcome, Louis.
The truth is, I needed this more than you know.
Well, there is one thing that you still need to do.
You need to start thinking about a new secretary.
Louis, I can't.
I get it.
We're better as friends.
Thank you, Donna.
Uh, yes, is there a Mary Ann McGrath here?
We'd like to speak with her in regards to an ongoing case.
But she's 55.
I don't really know, but I don't think she was getting the best care.
- Thank you.
My mother's 55.
I don't like it any more than you do, but it's not up to us.
I know.
Oh, don't be mad.
Yeah, Conchita tells everybody I'm not home.
You know what I'm talking about.
DuPont Investments dropped through the floor today, and you sold short based on something that I told you in confidence.
Maybe you're not the right man for me after all.
You think I still want to work for you after this?
You wanted competition and money.
Then you might as well add your name to the indictment since you've already shared in the profits.
What are you talking about?
Take a look at this check.
Bet you can guess where the other $150,000 went.
What did you do?
You're gonna break his little heart.
He thinks that money came from you.
And you snatch cash out of an addicted gambler's hands, take away his dream, only one way that story ends.
So you can either pout about it... or you can embrace it and prove to everyone I was right when I said I saw something special in you.
Someday the shoe's gonna be on the other foot, Charles.
Words spoken by every loser I've ever met.
See you around, pal.
It's Woodall's first wife.
And what's the money for?
And Mary Ann couldn't tell you because she doesn't speak.
Which mean we don't have any proof.
Mike and I both did.
Then why isn't he here?
My suspension is about to expire.
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.
We found Mary Ann.
I'm told she's doing well at the new facility-- you know, the one Forstman's paying for.
You son of a bitch.
Well, if this were over, you'd be with Sean Cahill right now, which means you're still looking for me to cut a deal.
I'm looking for you to turn on Forstman.
You accost me for the second time in three days and throw Mary Ann's name around like a bargaining chip, and you think I'm gonna help you?
Drop dead.
Eric, please.
The reason I knew to look for someone that you cared about was that Forstman did the same thing to me.
He finds your weakness and presses down until you don't have the will to stand up to him.
A lot of you don't know this, but the truth is, I hated Norma.
I hated her clogs, her mustache, her stupid seasonal sweaters.
But the thing I hated most about her was her favorite story about how Abe Vigoda asked her to marry him in 1975.
You turned him down, and it was the biggest regret of your life.
Don't let the moment pass.
Don't let the people you love walk by you without letting them know how you feel about them, because life slips by, and then it's over.
And I'm not gonna let another minute pass me by without letting you know how much you mean to me.
I love you, Norma.
Thank you, Louis.
That was a lovely ceremony.
That was beautiful, Louis.
And the truth is, Donna, you know me better than I know myself.
You want to save me the trouble and just admit what you did?
Why, because you think you convinced Woodall to give me up?
What I said was, you're an arrogant bastard who's spent his life manipulating people.
And you're the loser who only cares about competition.
Not my fault you can't beat me.
I can this time.
Oh, I don't think so, pal, because... he turns on me, I turn on you.
Yes, we were.
All three of us were-- you, me, and your brother.
You leave my brother out of this.
Not a chance.
And you don't leave this Woodall thing alone, by the time I'm done, all anybody will know about 12 years ago is you gave me a tip and made sure your little brother profited from it.
I didn't give you shit.
You tricked me into giving you inside information and then blackmailed me by giving Marcus money he didn't even know was dirty.
That may be the truth, but they're never gonna hear it from me.
I'm afraid they just did.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the guy from the SEC that isn't in your pocket.
Which is how I knew when to turn this on.
You're wearing a goddamn wire?
For someone whose favorite movie is Wall Street, that's got to be pretty embarrassing.
Son of a bitch.
You may have gotten the better of me 12 years ago, Charles, but this time, you didn't.
So remember what it feels like, because I know I will.
Harvey, this isn't over.
Words spoken by every loser I've ever met.
See you around, pal.
Two for two.
He didn't touch my balls.
Black, two sugars, splash of vanilla.
How do you know that's how I take my coffee?
The same way I know you're not taking that job.
You know I'm not taking that job because I came into work today.
I told you I know people better than they know themselves.
Well, what did you do with Tina?
Oh, I had Big Bertha reassign her.
- To who?
- Do you really care?
I will take a bullet for you.
And I don't mean that literally.
Will you also do some actual secretarial work?
Take a look at what I did with your calendar there, hotshot.
Holy shit.
When'd you get that done?
I told you I'm not like every other secretary.
I'm Donna.
You will after you taste that.
Oh, my God, this is awesome.
When will they learn?
Perfect timing.
And what are we celebrating?
Our win.
- Me too.
Where were you?
What is it?
You're the most amazing woman I have ever met, and you're not just beautiful, but you're sweet and caring and kind and brilliant and tenacious.
Mike, are-- are you doing what I think you're doing?
I called your father today.
And then I went to get Grammy's ring cleaned.
You're my whole life.
Will you marry me?
It's beautiful.
She wore it every day for almost 60 years.
So will I.
What's up, dickhead?
I just haven't talked to you in a while and wanted to see how you were doing.
Like I said, I just haven't talked to you in a while, and I miss you.
Nothing else.
Love you, Harvey.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
This isn't working for me anymore.
Donna, I know how you're feeling, but you just went through something huge, with being on trial, and, uh... you need to give it time.
I'm not quitting.
I'm going to work for Louis.
Donna, please.
30 years ago I'd found The Book of the Dead.
Now because I read from the book...
What did you see?
My mother.
She died.
You can't outrun evil Ash!
Watch me!
Ash!
That, my friends, is how we do it.
Look, I have no idea where you learned how to kill those things, but if whatever I saw...
They call 'em Deadites, and I'd say it's a gift from God, but that would be giving the man upstairs a little too much credit.
Very humble, but listen, if whatever I saw at my dad's house is a Deadite, then he's in a lot of danger.
We're way past danger.
That's why we have to get that book translated and find the phrase that'll put the lid back on all this bullshit.
Sorry, no can do.
Well, I can't just abandon him.
Shit.
Looks like your girlfriend took your bike.
I tried to get her to stop, but she wouldn't listen to me.
Well, I'm shoving' off to take care of the book.
Catch you on the flip-flop.
Umm, about the book... she took it.
She took it?
I can take you to her dad's.
All right, wipe your feet and get in.
So do you think Kelly's mom could have turned into a Deadite?
Moms don't just come back to life.
If Kelly's old lady's walkin' around, I'm probably gonna have to cut her head off.
Yeah, but-but I don't- I don't wanna end up dead like most folks.
Hey, do you-you got any fighting tips?
Trust me, once you get jacked in the face, it'll all click.
I can't even get my nut up to rumble unless I've had a good shot to the chin.
I mean, it looks like you've taken a bunch.
I don't know about that.
Oh my God, Mr. Roper!
Oh, shit!
You sad, old failure, you'll never defeat evil!
Yeah, thanks for the heads up.
Is this what it's like to be you?
Yeah, pretty much.
Never killed my boss before, so that was new.
That was the scariest thing that's ever happened to me.
At first I was like, "Did he mean it like that?"
This ain't my first rodeo, kid.
Hey, do you have a-a towel or something I could borrow?
Thanks.
You the police?
A lot of death around here lately.
Yeah, more than we've ever had.
Special Agent Fisher, Michigan State Police.
It's very possible this is connected to the killings from the other night.
Do you know who... who lived there?
Don't know his name, but he was always a real asshole to me and my wife, and our kids, and pretty much everyone else around.
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, whores, got it.
I'm pretty sure that's not the only place she had one.
Thanks for your help.
Please, please don't hurt us.
Take anything, but you will not touch my family!
My God, what are you guys doing here?
Oh, shit.
Why are you covered in blood?
I'm actually a hunter, and I've never seen a deer explode.
Well, maybe you're not hunting the right deer.
Okay, uh, could you just excuse us for one second?
No, but when it comes to Evil, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Now about my book.
Sweetie, is everything okay?
Um, Mom, Dad, this is my friend, Pablo.
Honey, it's okay.
The only thing I can remember is, driving to the store in a terrible storm, and I, uh, I went over a guardrail, and then... nothing for months.
Uh, they said she drowned, but they never found a body.
So, uh, we never gave up hope.
What a touching story.
Look lady, I don't know what game you're playin', but I want my book, and I want it now!
Yeah, that's him.
He looks way dumber in real life, but that is very close.
Are you the one behind all this?
Amanda, what are you doing here?
Give us a second.
I just thought, if there's a connection to what happened the other night, then...
Fisher, you were in an officer involved shooting.
You're not supposed to be anywhere near a crime scene right now.
Ah, hold on.
You what?
Oh, so you just lied to me?
You know I trusted you, Pablo!
I'm sorry, but at least everything is okay, and we get a free dinner.
You don't believe Mom's horseshit story, do ya?
I noticed they're brown and lovely, like her daughter's.
They can disguise themselves as human and just when you're comfortable, boom!
It's just a storm, Pablito.
Look, Ash, I think you're being really paranoid about this.
If you snag a little fish, you're not gonna eat it.
No, you use it as a bait fish, to catch the whale.
I'm the whale, Pablo.
Yeah, I got that.
And Kelly...
She's the bait.
Yeah, that's right.
Unfortunately for Mom, this whale swam in there with a big ol' shotgun.
She was just waiting for me to drop my guard.
That's why she's inviting us for dinner.
Hey, how you holdin' up?
I mean this must all be a big shock for you.
I would rather not have a gun at dinner.
Uh, the doctors said eventually I should regain everything.
I'll bet they did.
So what are your plans, Mom?
Well, now that you're back, what's your big plan?
Well, just try to get everything back to normal.
Thank you.
What's your favorite book?
The Old Man and the Sea.
What are you waitin' for?
You know you want a piece of this.
Pablo, believe it or not, the rude middle-aged man ya brought is kind of ruining my "mom time."
Ash, you're wrong, I'm right.
Can you hear me?
Suzy, Suzy!
Honey...?
Kelly, please.
Please help me.
You left dinner before Daddy excused you.
We can save her.
Yeah, well, your cooking was shit.
Good night, Ashley.
Mom, please!
Time to die!
You got that right.
Good night, Mother.
I hate whatever did this.
Yup, that was my takeaway, too.
Ash, I'm not sorry that I took your book to get you to come up here.
I'm not either.
Sometimes the whale needs his bait fish to remind him of where he is in the ocean.
Kelly, if you really hate what did this, you should come with us.
Let's bring the fight to it.
I mean, I guess I don't know what else I would do.
Well, she shouldn't be alone right now.
Plus, you're kinda like a young me.
Deadites ruined your life and you're hot as hell.
Okay, let's get to the book store and hit the undo button on this BS once and for all.
You know they were Jewish, right?
Whenever you're ready.
Because you trust everyone!
I'm meant to be part of this pack.
I get night terrors.
I'm starting to wonder if the rules to our supernatural world aren't as rigid as I once thought.
Well, you know someone your age should be happy you still have hair to cut.
I think you look great.
Well, thank you, son I should have had.
It's a woman, Stiles.
I want to know.
What's reasonable?
No, Deputy.
They want you for three to five.
So, why don't we get in the van and discuss a plea bargain that gets you out in two.
I'm going to kill you.
Donovan, if you think that shocks me, remember it was well-documented in your Anger Expression Inventory.
Deputies, escort the prisoner out.
I'm not angry like I'm gonna throw a brick through your window.
Just stuck there, forever.
Get him out of here!
What's the hell's an Anger Expression Inventory?
It's a test you take when you're applying to become a deputy.
That guy wanted to be a cop?
At least now he's getting the full law enforcement experience.
Do you mind slowing down?
I don't think this kid's in any rush to get to prison.
What's happening?
Get off the road!
Get off the road!
Hit my brake!
There's something on the roof.
The chemo signals?
Oh, I'm well aware of how you all monitor my emotional state.
You okay?
I got this from Braeden a few hours ago.
That's the first real bit of information we've gotten on the Desert Wolf in months.
Actually, the recommended position is now 9:00 and 3:00.
At 10:00 and 2:00, a deployed airbag could break your thumbs.
Mine would heal.
Save your strength.
And try not to destroy your beautiful new car.
9:00 and 3:00.
Please shut up.
And try to stay on the actual road.
You said, "Turn the wheel."
Maybe you should press a little harder on the gas...
Lydia, we're actually heading downtown.
No.
Keep going.
You sure?
We're almost there.
Call 911.
I don't think so.
We've got an APB out on him, but you think you can find him faster?
I can try.
Dad, what if it wasn't Donovan?
I'm guessing you've already got a theory?
Yeah, I think I do.
Scott, is that you?
Yeah, I found Donovan.
Stewart.
Tracy Stewart.
You're a Kitsune.
I don't even know what that is.
I'm still learning.
All right, what do we do when we catch her?
I say we put her down.
Intense.
I want my lawyer.
Your lawyer's dead.
I want another lawyer.
I know you saw something.
Tracy killed her father and badly wounded two officers.
One girl against three grown men.
I've got an answer to why we couldn't find Tracy last night.
She was in the hospital.
Doing what?
Killing her psychiatrist.
Let Scott know, but tell him I don't want them getting into it yet.
Shouldn't we be putting him on the payroll?
I'm starting to wonder.
So they deserved it?
She's good at her job.
Nice to see where your priorities are, Scott.
Since you have such a good grasp of the subject, how about you lead us in a review of last night's reading.
Are you all right?
Are you even supposed to be in this class?
Hey, we need to go.
Are you all right?
Tracy.
Tracy, let her go.
They're coming.
They're coming for all of us.
She wasn't even supposed to be in our class.
Do you need help getting to the Nurse's Office?
I think I'll make it.
They're taking her to the Animal Clinic?
Yeah, to see if Deaton can figure out what's wrong with her.
Alpha.
If she's a werewolf, she has an Alpha, right?
Anyone know if a new one's moved into Beacon Hills?
We know her.
And her pack.
Pupils dilate under normal conditions.
Heart rate is 250.
Evidence of an allogeneic skin graft on the right shoulder.
Now, this silvery substance at her lips is not something I've seen.
She makes a decent point.
Either way, eventually I'm going to have to let my dad know she's here.
No.
Maybe.
Don't worry about it.
Okay, so what are we looking for?
I am not sure.
I'm mostly just following a feeling.
Your feelings usually lead to dead bodies.
Well, let me know if you find one.
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm afraid of.
Well, you and I will be able to get out of here no problem.
Weird.
Scott, would you mind holding her down.
I'm going to be trying a few more invasive tests.
I think you're gonna need a bigger blade.
Could Satomi have turned her without you knowing?
Or you can be born, like me and my sister.
Satomi took us in after our family died in a fire.
Guys, I think I just found something.
Hey, look at this.
He was just trying to help her.
Why would she go after him like that?
I guess she wasn't in control of herself.
But it wasn't even a full moon.
They had no idea what they were doing.
It's called a homicidal somnambulism.
She's still in a night terror.
Now, this is interesting.
What's up?
It's my mom.
Malia, help me turn her over, please.
Driver didn't have stroke or heart attack.
I think I know what she is.
Do you care to enlighten the rest of us?
Because this doesn't look too good.
It wasn't a werewolf.
Kanima.
Scott did it.
Once, but it almost killed me.
We should've killed her.
Meanwhile, she's probably on her way to killing someone else.
Doc, how do we focus?
Think of a body part.
See it in your mind and your body will follow.
I think I found it.
See the necklace?
No, I don't see it.
She didn't fall in here.
She was buried.
Intense.
I'm pretty sure I just felt my right leg move.
What's happening?
There's no time.
Look, she's not a werewolf.
Save her.
So was her psychiatrist.
And maybe that's why she was at the school.
No, you're right.
My mother.
What if Tracy went to the school looking for her?
Where is she now?
On a date.
Thanks for meeting me here, it's been a hectic day at the station.
Me too.
Clark?
What the hell are you doing?
I can't move.
Mom, she's coming.
Tracy's coming for you.
Why isn't it here?
She probably came back for it.
I don't think this is the one.
What do you mean?
This is a different hole.
Then who crawled out of this one?
Kira, look out!
I heard about Tracy, I've been looking for you.
We lost her.
This is Theo?
Let me help.
It just means I can help catch this girl.
I can help you.
Careful...
Get her to understand.
They?
Tracy?
You're not dreaming.
You're not dreaming, Tracy.
Terminal.
What does the book do?
It triggers the memory centers of the brain.
Hey, slow down.
Desert Wolf.
We never should have read that book.
Chimeras.
Two dead Chimeras.
And eight new ones.
So, that's 10 in all.
I'm thinking maybe 11.
Our station tech guys confirmed something for me...
They said, both the holding cell lock and cameras could have malfunctioned because of something electromagnetic.
You said that, uh, these guys...
Dread Doctors.
Are we really calling them that?
So they broke Donovan out?
It's how they got into Eichen, isn't it?
If he is, he's probably dead.
Not until I've seen a body.
You're uncharacteristically quiet.
So, now shouldn't we be trying to figure out why these teenagers?
They had to have something in common.
Something that made them right for this experiment.
Something that made them special.
Arms up.
This way you can block attacks to your face and your head while always keeping your eyes on your enemy.
Ready?
Ready when you are.
Muscle memory.
So, basically, we're looking for abnormal behavior?
Anyone acting a little off or a little weird.
Isn't everyone a little weird in high school?
Yeah, good point.
You remember Tracy went on a killing spree after reading that?
You think it's a bad idea?
I think Malia almost getting run down by a car could've been bad.
Well, that's why you guys haven't finished it, right?
We're going to.
Scott, I came here hoping to find a pack.
I wasn't planning on watching one fall apart.
The book's all we've got.
Then I'll read it too.
My mom's book club usually has more wine.
Well, they also probably didn't read books that cause violent hallucinations.
That's why Malia's here.
So none of us go running into traffic?
Or worse.
Like what happened to Judy.
Chapter 14.
Maybe I should have my mother read it.
She might remember a girl with a tail leaping off the ceiling and attacking everyone.
Yeah, if it works.
It has to.
What does that mean?
I think I saw them during my surgery.
Anyone feel anything yet?
Tired.
Hungry.
I think he meant the book.
With the accident, did it play like a movie in your head or was it like being completely in it again?
In it.
Nothing.
You're not giving up, are you?
Just resting my eyes.
My glow stick broke.
No, it ran out of glow.
They don't last forever.
Can I have my money back?
God, I hate all-ages night.
Forty-three dollars.
I said I don't want your money.
I'm just trying to make up for the sixth grade.
Nothing will make up for the sixth grade.
Yeah, but how are we supposed to trigger a memory that we don't remember?
We keep an eye on each other today, okay?
Yes, and keep an eye out for eight other potentially homicidal Chimeras.
And keep an eye out for the Dread Doctors.
Starting to see the appeal of a third eye.
So while introducing the African Cane Toad, sounded like a good way to deal with Australia's infestation of the Grey-backed beetle, unfortunately, the toad also decided to eat everything else in sight.
Once an invasive species is introduced, everything changes.
Lydia, you know it's for the best.
I was just looking for your mom.
I mean Mrs. Martin.
Are you okay?
Does this look okay?
How long has it been happening?
Three years.
Years?
It's stress.
Have you tried not taking the hardest classes in school?
I told you to stay in the car.
Lydia, I told you to stay in the car.
What have you done to yourself?
I told you to stay in the car.
They're coming, Lydia.
They're coming for all of us.
Are you okay?
You remembered something.
- Mom, I'm fine.
It was nothing.
Mom, I'm fine.
I promise.
Not into sci-fi?
That's the book, isn't it?
I thought you guys were supposed to finish reading it last night.
Yeah, I kind of haven't yet.
And I'm pushing a C-average in English.
How come?
'Cause I met one.
Yeah, but there's a reason why you have to say it twice on the phone.
Because according to Japanese folklore, fox spirits have difficulty with language.
And the way that you prove that you're not a fox, when you answer the phone, you say "moshi" twice.
So is the book.
You know, it's just one long language trick.
That's why I can't read it?
I swear that wasn't me.
You forgot to sign it.
Are you going to tell me why you're dropping?
It's a schedule thing.
Why did you take this class to begin with?
Isn't it a prerequisite for the college you want?
It just doesn't matter.
What's happening?
Mom...
Where's Roxy?
Sweetheart, she didn't make it.
Where's Roxy?
Scott, you need to breathe.
Visible scorpion stingers protruding out of limbs?
Sorry.
That's not the best year for Liam's anger management issues.
Scott, come on.
Thanks.
Okay, then what are we doing here if you've already had your suppressed memory?
I'm not supposed to know that, am I?
Why haven't you said anything?
About what?
Why didn't you tell Scott?
I didn't think you wanted me to.
I don't.
Are you going to want to know why?
Not really.
I don't need any favors.
Then what do you want?
I want in the pack.
That's not up to me.
If you want to tell Scott what you saw, tell him.
And you're supposed to be embarrassed by your parents, not your sister.
Do I have to remind you, one bottle costs $200?
What?
Nothing.
Was that Liam Dunbar?
He got cute.
You gonna be okay?
I think it was just the memory hitting me.
Psychosomatic thing.
Did you want to talk about something?
I didn't just hear it.
I found a website that can translate it.
Does it get worse?
She's got this aura all around her.
And to be honest...
I don't know if I could trust her anymore.
Can you turn the lights on?
Ask someone.
Hey, I thought this was more of an auditory thing.
I still wanna see what I'm hearing.
Well, we've been having issues for the last hour, maintenance is coming to check it out.
For now that floor is down to backup lighting.
But you said this was more of a hearing thing.
This definitely isn't Kira.
It's a Chimera.
Where's Kira?
They said they're just waiting for the power to go back on?
Well, the base pay is crap, but with tips, you can make up to a grand in one night.
Maybe less.
I promised I'd pay you back.
No, it wasn't your fault.
I punched you in the face.
I meant the shots.
It's for a kidney transplant I had a few years ago.
I work here so my sister doesn't have to pay for all of it.
Now, can you just forget about it?
I'll make it back somehow.
And never stops bragging about it.
Just listen to him.
It's not like they're gonna do anything.
They're all under the table and too young to be selling alcohol anyway.
Close your eyes.
Are you kidding?
I swear I'm not gonna do anything.
Your condition worsens.
What are you doing up there?
I couldn't stand to be in that room anymore.
Not with him looking at me like that.
No.
That's not true.
Come on down.
Come here.
Remember what the dementia does?
It gives you delusions.
It makes you think that people are out to get you...
You don't see the way he looks at me.
Claudia, he's 10 years old.
He's trying to kill me.
Malia, come on!
We never should have read that book.
Why not?
Because I never said anything about Donovan.
They're here.
No.
What do you mean, "No"?
This can't be the only way to save her life.
It saved mine.
Which is why I'm not going to do something I think is going to kill her.
There has to be...
There has to...
There's another way to save her.
Guys, I don't know what the statistics are for surviving a werewolf bite, but she's definitely not surviving this.
We need to do something.
10-4, Unit 5, back off and maintain eyes.
Dispatch to all units, be on the lookout for suspicious bipedal animal.
I'm here!
What's that?
It's called chelation therapy.
It removes heavy metals from the blood.
But, the problem is, is that can injure the kidneys and Hayden only has one to begin with, so...
Hey, you're hurting her.
And you're hurting me.
It's the full moon.
We can feel it even during the day.
And it's a Supermoon.
You know we're going to need help with him.
He'll be all right.
He's 16 and in love.
Yeah, trust me, I remember.
I know.
We need help, and I don't mean restraints or chains.
I mean Malia, Stiles, Lydia.
You need your pack, Scott.
I'm not so sure I have one anymore.
Let me talk to them.
Go home, Lydia.
Stilinski isn't telling anyone where he put the bodies, and I'm pretty sure I'm not psychic.
But you're drawn to death.
Just like me.
Does that make me a kind of Banshee?
You find bodies.
I find Chimeras.
Dead Chimeras.
So, we're both harbingers of death.
It's on my college applications.
Can they fix it?
There's not enough duct tape in the world to fix that thing.
Maybe you should try something other than duct tape.
How come you let it get so bad?
There's been a few distractions, if you haven't noticed.
I notice.
More than you think I do.
Uh, I didn't mean it like that.
Am I taking you home?
I gotta talk to my dad.
It doesn't scare me as much.
That I know.
Do I scare you?
How come?
Because I saw you.
I saw the Banshee.
But I guess it was just a dream or a hallucination.
What was I doing?
Trying to keep me alive.
Well, sorry, but the Banshee was mostly trying to stay out the rain.
That was the night of the storm, remember?
The Wild Hunt.
The what?
Oh, it's something Kira was telling me.
A myth about thunderstorms...
Ghost Riders in the sky and black dogs...
What is it?
I need to check on something.
You know what I mean.
It's not working, is it?
She should be showing signs of improvement.
I don't want to die without my sister.
I'll get her.
You want me to go in with you?
Are you going to tell him about Donovan?
You knew?
I guessed.
I saw the bite on your shoulder while you were sleeping.
It didn't matter to me.
That's why I never said anything.
It matters to me.
"The Hellhound."
You know what's coming.
Don't you?
Someone's going to die here.
You're right.
How did you do that?
It's on her neck too.
She's getting worse, isn't she?
How's that going to help?
We're in an animal clinic and I need equipment designed for humans.
Do you want to learn?
I can show you.
You're showing me plenty right now.
I've got nothing to hide.
And I do?
Did you tell Scott you're planning to kill your mother?
Don't worry, I'm not judging.
Because I know Scott won't.
I'm trying to help all of you.
If Scott can't do it, then someone else needs to take the lead.
You know they're moving Hayden to the hospital, right?
But Hayden's still a Chimera, and there's two more we haven't found yet, and they're still dangerous.
They need help.
They need you.
What the hell...
What's happening?
My sister...
Scott's out looking for her right now.
He's going to bring her here as soon as he can, all right?
That's not possible.
You're right.
A werewolf shouldn't even be able to touch mountain ash.
You're a Chimera.
I'm the first Chimera.
It's the coyote part you don't notice.
It's why Malia trusted me first, even though she probably didn't know it.
You found the perfect word though, Scott.
And they realized you?
They came close with me.
But we can't all be perfect.
We can't all be true Alphas.
No calls, Scott.
No Stiles, no Malia, no Lydia.
You're just going to have to wait here alone for what happens next.
What do you mean?
What's next?
The Supermoon.
Over here, yeah.
Is she dying?
With the amount of mercury in her body right now, she shouldn't even be alive.
Wolfsbane.
Theo let you in.
Did you lie to me?
I've never lied to you.
But you won't save her.
I can't save her.
At least, not with a bite.
If you'd just think about that for a second, Liam, you would know that I'm right.
I am thinking!
I'm thinking about alternatives.
I think you better get Liam.
What about Scott?
Because she's dying, and I don't know what else to do.
Go.
What the hell was that?
I don't know what's going on around here, but I'm guessing things are bad again.
'Cause your plan...
I don't think Scott wants to talk to you right now.
Scott doesn't want to talk to you.
But I think your dad does.
Don't do this, Liam!
I can't let you kill me.
Where is he?
I covered for you.
This was taken care of.
If Melissa didn't find it at the hospital...
Guess even the son of a cop can make mistakes.
Did you hurt him?
I never lied about why I came to Beacon Hills.
I'm here for a pack.
I came for the Banshee, the girl surrounded by death.
I came for the dark Kitsune, the Beta with anger issues...
Unfortunately, it doesn't include Scott.
Your heartbeat's rising, Stiles.
It's not because you're afraid.
Nogitsune is gone, but you've still got more blood on your hands than any of us.
I'm about to get more.
I'll tell you where your dad is, if you promise not to help Scott.
There he is!
We won't tell Scott.
'Cause you can't lose your best friend, right?
Even though we both know, you never needed him.
You hate me now, but you'll get it eventually.
You've still got time, Stiles.
You've still got time.
He's using you, Liam.
He wants you to be the Alpha because he can't take the power from me.
Only you can.
But once you do, he'll take it from you.
That's why he wants you to kill me...
That's what you don't get, Scott.
Liam, what are you doing?
Hayden.
She's gone.
Hayden died a few minutes ago.
She's gone.
It's the Supermoon.
Because now you have to kill me yourself.
Not for you.
They're not like you.
They never will be.
Because I'm a Chimera?
Because I'm not a real werewolf?
Because you're barely even human.
You're an Alpha.
Yes, I see it...
I can see it.
I lost, Mom.
Every leader suffers loss.
Sometimes more than you think is bearable.
But this time, I lost everyone.
Why would they come back?
Because you're their leader.
And even when a leader thinks they have nothing left to give, there's still one thing.
Hope.
Give them hope.
Come on, Lydia.
Watch this, Lydia.
You think you lost your mind?
Well, watch this!
Who are you?
I'm your Alpha.
La Bete.
La Bete.
La Bete.
Success.
The point is, the work is called 'The Perfect Family'.
There's also another piece called 'The Nightmare'.
Do you want a job?
If there's a number or character for every victim, we have three left now.
- What kind of car was it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Are you in?
- Three thousand and this here.
- It's about the threats, I suppose.
- You mean Alice's?
- They're in the bedroom, in the other dresser drawer.
Then I'll borrow a pair.
That's okay with you, isn't it?
Who found them?
- A break-in, then?
- Likely the owners, but that's unconfirmed.
These are the house's owners, Filip and Inger Johansson.
- How long have they been sitting like this?
- Do they have brand marks in their mouths?
It's important that they be sent quickly to Forensics in Lund.
We usually do that.
What the hell ...
What can a disembodied brain symbolize?
- What about the apple in the mouth?
In any case, this points to Holst.
On the list Emil gave us, there was 'Canceling Christmas'.
- Was someone living down here?
If they also have symbols in their mouths, there's only one symbol left in the code.
It could suggest that there's only one victim left.
I'm thinking Freddie Holst.
- I usually do.
You decide when you want to see them, so you probably didn't want to see them.
Yeah, maybe.
But I missed them.
- Jeanette and I.
- You got 28,000 yesterday.
You've gambled it away.
That's why I need an advance.
His name is Simon Mortensen.
It's not legal to buy a child.
To sell a baby is certainly not legal.
We're not selling the child.
- Jeanette is a surrogate mother.
- A surrogate mother only gets her expenses paid.
But perhaps you'd rather have that than half a million?
Come on.
Before the show, we talked a lot about involving the relatives.
And there were new casket models, new color combinations ...
Pick me up tonight?
The train from GÃ♪teborg arrives at half past nine.
- What things?
- Underwear, some clothes, toothbrush.
It will be easier, now that I'm staying with you sometimes.
Chin up.
See you tonight.
Do you have time to meet today?
I don't need to know you to know that you should leave Marc.
Me and Marc, we love each other.
Sometimes we love the wrong people.
That doesn't mean anything.
What's it to you, when I'll soon be leaving?
- I think about you.
- Yeah, of course you do now.
No, not just now.
I'm going to be a father, thanks to you.
That is the biggest favor I can get.
It doesn't matter.
Hi.
What does it look like?
- I could use an appraisal.
- It's a knock-off.
- It's worth ten times that.
- So sell it elsewhere for ten times that.
Just a minute!
Thanks for the deal.
It's in the museum.
Imagine a traditional Christmas meets a hand grenade in slow motion.
- Do you like Christmas?
- No, not especially.
Are they officially declared dead?
- Have you checked up on me?
Don't do that.
We have three new killings, two new pieces.
Why does all this point to you?
In any case, we'd like to offer you and your wife personal protection.
So if there's nothing more ...
Now you've been offered, anyway.
- You wanted to show me something.
- What is it?
- What has she been buried in?
Take the pen there.
It doesn't seem to be the same type of character as before.
These are rounder.
Do you know what it is?
Many of them are no longer in use.
You can take the photos with you.
Yes, I've already done that.
L and G. From the Glagolitic alphabet.
Which is?
So now we know.
Now we're only missing the 6.
So we have one victim left, and Freddie Holst refuses protection.
The murderer wants to point to Holst, but we don't know if he's the next victim.
What do we know about the ones we found this morning?
A yellow car was seen in the area some days ago.
The airline confirms that he was on board the flight to Singapore on the 8th.
- Could he have sold the car?
- Not according to the Transport Agency.
- Did the Johanssons have children?
- No, but they were foster parents.
Since '85.
Do we have a list of the children?
- Not yet, but I've contacted Social Services.
- It's urgent that we get it.
There's no connection to any of the other victims so far.
What about the list of employees at Anderson TL?
- It's coming soon.
- Do you have a moment?
Close the door.
- Sit down.
It's important to follow up.
If I stop feeling good, I can tell you, so you won't have to ask me all the time.
I don't know if I should say this, but there's something you should know.
The preliminary investigation shows your mother may not have killed herself.
It looks like she was murdered.
Do you have any idea who could have done it?
I had no contact with her for 20 years but there were a lot of people who might not have liked her.
Can I go now?
Yeah, do that.
Tell me if you need time off.
I never need time off.
- Have you waited long?
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
I thought you'd be working around the clock in Denmark.
- I got upset and left.
- Without notice?
You don't work with Saga, I see.
- They didn't appreciate me, so ...
- What do you do, actually?
I'm watching a Danish family.
- Two cappuccinos, please.
They're well-known in Denmark.
- Soy milk in mine.
- Holst is their name.
Look at the address.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what was the assignment?
What kind of work is that?
Is that even legal?
- How do you get the money?
- In my account, when I deliver the photos.
- Can you track money from an email address?
- There's a faster way, maybe.
We can send a file with a virus, so I can track the computer.
- That can take time before it's opened.
- He usually responds right away.
I need a photo.
Take this.
What, do you owe money or something?
- How much can I get for it?
- What do you want for the lot?
Ah, we've gotten a fucking email.
Exciting.
- Whose is this?
- I have no idea.
Okay, but this guy is a cop.
Do you have a price or what?
The signal is coming from Copenhagen.
I'll contact Lillian.
- Keep us updated.
I'm coming!
The Danish police are on the way.
Fuck.
- We came too late.
- I understood that.
- It turned onto Njalsgade.
- What are we looking for?
- Coming up on ÃÂrestads Boulevard.
It's turning.
It's stopped.
It's completely stopped there.
There's a yellow car.
John, can you check registration number UUF 294?
It belongs to Kjell SÃ♪der.
It's empty.
The train!
Go in the building.
- Farther into the building.
If you're on the same floor, you should be passing him.
Wait.
He's going out again.
- Where should we go?
- To the other side of the metro.
- Where are you now?
- On the other side.
It's right there.
They lost the signal.
Do you know how dumb it feels to wait for someone who doesn't come?
And a text took too long to send?
I thought I could make it, but that didn't happen.
Sorry.
Can I come in?
You invite me to your talk, but you don't want to meet, and now you come here.
- There's an explanation for that.
- I'd like to have it.
Annika, whom you met at the opening ...
Yeah, I saw her in Malmo.
- Do you have a little stalker?
- It's actually not funny.
Report her to the police.
Her funeral business is handling Dad's burial.
Yeah, I probably can.
Who is that?
Ah, that's our cleaning lady.
- Is Freddie home?
- No, he isn't.
It would mean a lot to me if you'd come to Dad's burial.
As you know, you were his favorite.
What does your stalker say about it?
I'll fix it before then.
- What are you doing here?
- I was visiting ÃÂsa.
Why?
Sure, but not you.
In your dreams.
I've had a really shitty day, okay?
Because you didn't see your family?
No, that's not why.
In that case, he must have figured out how we were tracking him or her.
- Thanks for the help.
- Is that her job, spying on people?
No, she's a photographer, but she's had a hard time finding work.
- We told them about the surveillance.
We need the videos from the metro station and the mall.
- Lillian is going through the material.
- I want John to look at that.
I trust that the Danes can analyze surveillance footage.
I don't.
It's classified, but I'm working on it.
- Kjell Grankvist.
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
This is regarding the murder of your mother, Marie-Louise Norén.
- Why do you want to talk about her?
- I'm from Internal Affairs.
You're only called if an employee has committed a crime or has made other mistakes.
We can also help if a family member is a victim of a crime.
So where were you when your mother was murdered?
I don't know the time of death.
There.
- I'd gotten an email telling me to come.
Why not?
She had criticized my performance, and I wanted to get back at her.
I want to see that.
- Why would she do that?
She didn't like me.
How did you feel when she showed up again?
I don't know.
Try to put words to your strongest feeling.
You hadn't seen each other for how many years?
20.
How did you know that I didn't like her?
But I never said that I didn't like her.
Yes, you have, actually.
So how did you feel?
Open your mouth, please.
Thanks.
We're finished for today.
I can maybe get that email on the way out?
- Thanks for your help.
You're late.
As a photographer you sneak around and take photos of people's private lives.
How can you defend your work when he killed himself?
It wasn't my fault.
So you hadn't received threats when you asked me to check that number.
No, I hadn't.
It's only wrong if you're caught.
Is that how you see things?
Everything is alright, so long as you don't get caught?
You're leaving now?
I think we shouldn't see each other for a while.
It must not come out, that you're here.
Yet you walk around outside the house.
I don't think you understand how much is at stake here.
We are not just anyone, Freddie and I. It isn't about money and it isn't about whether it's legal or illegal.
I have pretended to be pregnant, and if that were to come out ...
So keep away from the house!
- I've been busy all day.
- With gambling away our house again?
Is it Holst who said that?
So you did?
They think I have something to do with my mom's death.
Are you saying she was murdered?
Internal Affairs has nothing to do with crimes against family members.
That is out there.
Unless she wanted it to appear that way.
She said that I threatened her.
- Why would she do that?
- As revenge for what?
- You can't ask about that.
Saga, where are you going?
The toilet.
I just thought you would leave.
- Do you want me to go?
- What's that?
- Don't you recognize them?
- Sure, but where did you get them?
Why did you do this?
Jeanette, I said that I'm thinking about you.
Thank you.
Goodnight, Freddie.
- Have you been at her place again?
I see her two or three times a day.
Please.
We wanted to have a child, no?
But we can't have children.
I can't have children.
That's why I don't want her to live here, or to have to see her.
We're renting her body for nine months, so the child is yours.
And then we'll never see her again.
Now we've found out that his brain function isn't good either.
He is braindead.
It's the respirator that's keeping him alive.
Sometimes people wake up again.
After being in a coma, yes.
But braindead ...
I'll ask you to think about the future and eventual donations and what we will do regarding the respirator.
- May I see him now?
- What about the list of foster children?
- You have no photos of your employees.
Change.
Just do it.
First you believe in him but then you realize he doesn't exist.
It hurts even with a vest.
- Did you see the car?
- Come on.
- Lay off.
"Wait for reinforcements." How hard can that be to understand?
But you were in the same foster family at the Johanssons'.
- Did you treat him badly?
- No one had it good there.
That wasn't what I asked.
Why do you want to know that?
- He kidnapped you to frame you for several murders.
I don't know why.
No, he seemed mostly relieved that you were gone.
We continue the surveillance anyway.
He'd built an exact copy of the room in the cellar.
- How does the room in Ystad look now?
I had a painting in my room.
A copy of an amateur painting by a Danish artist who was rightfully forgotten.
But that painting was the only beautiful thing in my life.
I used to fantasize about how it would be in there.
Do you want to hold him?
Then came that psycho Morten Anker and I got to know about you.
It was like everything died.
Do you understand that?
You're an art connoisseur, for fuck's sake.
Why didn't you see it, Dad?
No, it wasn't good enough.
- The painting...
They're similar, but not identical.
But the painting there is exactly the same.
The car that Rasmus saw was reported stolen yesterday morning in Lomma.
- It's from the foster home where Emil lived.
Find out who the artist is, what it's called, and if it depicts a place that exists.
Everything we had on Annika Melander matches Emil Larsson, too.
We also have a connection between him and Helle Anker.
We had him and let him go two times.
- You had no reason to suspect him of it.
- It was still a mistake.
- Is it called anything?
- 'A Very Fine Day', from '93.
He's made these kinds of paintings in all the Nordic countries.
- Is he alive?
- Yeah, he turns 76 this year.
After becoming a pensioner, settled in Saltholm, right between Malmo and Copenhagen.
- Do you have a phone number?
It's regarding a painting that you painted.
Is it important?
- Is it related to our case?
- No, but it's important.
- Can I send you a photo of it?
- Keep me informed at all times.
He's painted hundreds of paintings called 'A Very Fine Day' and he has neither a computer nor a phone, so we can't send him any photos.
What can I do to stop you?
I've been afraid every day since I was five.
No one should have to experience that.
Get up.
Get up!
I just need... my glasses.
- Here you go.
- Do you recognize this?
- Yes, there.
Where is 'there'?
- Yeah, but it's faster.
Stop.
Go up.
Then I'll shoot you, and you won't know what happens with little brother.
Put the noose on.
Don't do this.
- Only if you have power.
Now you can hold him as long as you're conscious.
I assume you'll drop him.
You and me, together inside a painting.
A very fine day.
Take Emil!
He killed Hans.
Saga, take Emil!
Come on!
Come on!
Were you really going to let him die?
Yeah, I shot them.
I was forced to.
Then we have these.
My works.
I tried to get his attention.
Freddie's?
I had to help you.
I had 172 pills... all sorts that I was just about to take when he came.
- When who came?
His mom felt guilty because he went crazy in Afghanistan.
- His mother, Helle Anker?
Okay.
And it was these people who were responsible for your suffering.
The Johanssons we know a bit about.
Hans Pettersson drove you back when you ran away.
That's when I ended up in the cellar.
He molested me for four years.
My creators.
They're your creators.
But why just them, Emil?
- How was she?
- She loved me.
So if she hadn't died, you would have been fine.
She just collapsed in the kitchen while making lunch for me.
That wasn't Freddie Holst's fault.
- Didn't you?
- I didn't punish anyone.
I should never have been born.
I don't know how much you know, but here he is.
Do you want to hold him?
No.
I have no desire to see him.
I can take him.
I'll be there shortly.
The receipt for the payment.
I've put in a little extra.
Thanks.
You knew Hans Pettersson.
Yes.
You liked him.
Yes.
Did he like you?
- Yes.
- So you were friends.
Why did you save me, then?
I'm police.
You wanted to die.
It's not really the same thing.
Do you understand?
No, you don't understand.
As you know, Annika Melander has been cleared, and we let Claes Sandberg go.
Did he choose to be happy?
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.
Good.
- Hans' funeral is tomorrow.
- But you're going Hans' tomorrow?
- Will you come with me?
Then I will.
- See you tomorrow.
- What's this about?
- Let's take it inside.
- Do you want anything?
- Yeah, of course.
They estimate that they've been in the ground for five to six years.
They've managed to identify her with the help of DNA.
It isn't.
- I'm so sorry.
- It isn't.
And you're wrong.
Where did my girls go?
They fucking were together.
So where did they go if they were with her?
- Did they stop looking?
- They've dug everywhere.
- They aren't here, Henrik.
That's almost worse.
I know that you're alone.
Your mother, she...
Anger replaces sorrow and displaces the bright memories we have of Hans and that we really need.
Hans would not have wanted that.
He always tried, despite the work he did to see the good in every person.
You gave him life.
Receive him in your peace.
And give him, for Jesus Christ's sake, a joyful resurrection.
Bye.
About what?
They found Alice.
Are you using drugs?
Stimulants?
And sleeping pills to relax?
How long have you been addicted?
Since they disappeared.
- Have you been on them while we've worked together?
- The whole time.
Yeah.
Do you remember why?
Because everyone, in one way or another, has left you or hurt you.
You're here?
How was the funeral?
I thought you'd take the day off.
- He cut his wrist.
Someone said he took a paper clip.
Is everything okay?
Follow me.
There was another thing I needed to tell you.
I don't think you did anything to your mom but one can't ignore the technical evidence there is.
- Are they starting an investigation?
- Only you and I know, and it doesn't need to be more than that.
But if I'm going to be investigated, then I'll be removed from my duties.
I'm very sorry.
I can't give you permission to look for them on your own.
You haven't heard?
Heard what?
Saga, it's me!
Hey, Wiki.
What are you doing here again?
I quit.
I really like my job.
It's not like with you, but I like being an investigator.
But that's not all I am.
I was first Alice's husband, and I was a father to two girls.
And that was taken from me.
Saga, I really need you.
Stay there!
- Don't do it!
- Stay there!
I need you!
Look at this.
Are you coming?
Even if we find it, the chance that it will lead to anything is minimal.
Previously on The Last Man on Earth...
Phil's been missing for about 24 hours.
This guy belong to you?
I'm Phil, Phil Miller.
No, I'm Phil Miller.
Maybe you should both go by your middle names.
So, why's it living up here now?
She's going down the stairs!
Doesn't just work on cows, hon.
Oh, you're welcome.
Friggin' Phil.
Admit it!
You're afraid that the new buck in town is gonna spray all over your turf.
Carol, look around you!
Every inch of this place is already covered in layers and layers of Tandy Miller spray.
So, what... then we just have an empty pool?
Why don't you ask him?
Maybe I'll do that.
Maybe I ought to go lend a hand on fixing that generator.
Yeah, I can't find anything wrong with this thing.
It seems to be working just fine.
I didn't do anything.
Oh, you know, if it's food you're after, I can make you a real home-cooked meal.
Well, you know, uh, this cul-de-sac's pretty full, but there are a lot of great houses on the outskirts of town.
But I got a housing option that might just help you, huh?
A little bachelor pad action.
Come on, choose this Sophie.
What's all this?
I-I was just kidding, but... good for you.
I picked this up to handle the garbage pool situation.
You-you need any help or...?
All right, Tom.
Hey, Todd!
Frickin' Phil.
Uh, if you ever want to have any guests over, just run it by me... standard stuff.
Basically, it feels like a shower.
Five... six!
Oh, speaking of snakes... what do you think of this bad boy?
Not bad, huh?
Hey, who does this guy think he is, huh?
Phil...
What are you doing, Tandy?
Ah, you know, uh, just going about my customary business in my own house.
Huh, why don't you go put some clothes on?
What are you trying to say?
Well, you took off your shirt yesterday.
And now suddenly being shirtless is a crime?
I was about to take a shower.
Erica, g'day!
Todd, come on.
- I was just helping Phil.
Don't... hang out with him.
I dump you, okay?
See, it's funny how sweaty you can get working on an ice machine.
That's funny.
I sure did.
Y'all are welcome to use it anytime you want to.
Well, I might just take you up on that offer 'cause I am very, very dirty.
What's, what's that, Carol?
Oh, just a dumb scarf I made you.
It gets drafty in this house.
For me?
Thanks for the scarf.
Well played, Carol.
Well played.
So now I see that exposing my genitals to Phil was just a massive misfire.
Well, how could you have known?
So, uh, what'd you want to talk to me about, bud?
Oh, nothing, other than blowing the best thing that ever happened to me.
Melissa and I broke up less than three hours ago, and I'm already in a kind of free fall.
Ah, thanks, man.
Hey, do you think I'm being paranoid, or do you think Phil really wants to sleep with Melissa?
Todd, don't worry.
He's a monster.
Attention, everyone.
Here's some trash talk that I can get behind.
And that definitely doesn't stink.
Bravo.
Do you have a problem with me?
Well, maybe that's 'cause I do.
What's your problem with me?
Oh, you friggin' come in here and try to impress everybody with all your skills that pay the bills.
I got no beef with you, Tandy.
That's President Tandy to you.
Okay, I think we've had enough of this president crap.
Oh, so you think the American system of government is crap.
No, I think the fact that you think you're president is crap.
Yes, it is, and even if it wasn't, none of you seem to be interested in the responsibility.
So unless any of you want to get off your butts and throw your hats in the ring, looks like you're stuck with little old me.
Well, I'd throw my hat in the ring.
You want to be the president, huh?
I say we revote right now.
Well, I would like to give a speech.
No speeches, all in favor of Phil being president, raise your hand.
Hey, Tucson is my hometown, and I will not hear it be slandered like that.
- Don't get me wrong...
- We're here, Mr. President, because Tandy, here, had the good sense to put up those "Alive in Tucson" signs, so we should all be thanking him.
Can we take a look at it, your farm?
Yeah, let's go.
What about first thing in the morning?
First thing in the morning... as early as we can do it, yeah.
Cock a doodle doo!
Tandy Farms is open for business!
Todd, what's the matter?
Sex with who?
Haven't you done enough plowing for one day?
You know, just Todd had said that you had all done, uh, something else.
Just friends taking showers, individually, toweling off on their own, coming out, joining each other once they're fully clothed.
Nice job, Tandy, this is a really good start.
Yeah... you're welcome.
You know, I-I just want to say I feel like you caught me on a weird week.
It's pure animal instinct.
You feel me, Philbert?
Oh, I feel you.
Hello.
I like it.
You noticed.
It's in the tree, it's high up there.
We got to kill this guy.
I'm in.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...
The cure to vampirism.
You're gonna take the cure, Elena, and I'm gonna take it with you.
- It's not healing.
I made a list of all the things that I've done since I fell for you.
Because you're a control freak who's lost control.
That's what falling for somebody is.
Control is all I have, and I don't think that I can give that up.
Before the 1900s, Lily fell in with a group of witches that were cast out of the Gemini coven...
It's time we get the hell out of this place.
Welcome to the wedding of Alaric Salzman and Josette Laughlin.
What are you doing?
Waiting for you.
It's bad, isn't it?
I believe you owe me a dance, miss Gilbert.
Dance with me, please, Elena.
Somebody, please help me.
She won't wake up.
Oh, my God.
I just don't feel like competing for leadership with future Gemini twins.
This ought to do it.
Why not?
I have nothing left to fight for.
He did, and I don't know how, but I'm still alive.
He drained my blood, and that's all.
That's not all.
Oh, my God.
And Elena got knocked out, and she's not waking up.
The doctors keep telling me there's nothing physically wrong with her.
Kai is dead, and all the Geminis are going down with him, and I grabbed the two of you to help me deal with a bigger problem.
Get in the car, please.
My friends.
Kai brought them back when he escaped that prison.
You made a deal with a sociopath, and now a lot of people are dead.
You're wasting your time!
This can't be happening.
Oh, God.
Your dad, your coven, they're all in there, dying, which means...
I love you, Liv.
You need to know that if this has to be it for us.
You're not dying, Tyler.
It's a full moon.
You once told me that I gave you a second chance, and you promised me that you wouldn't waste it.
I love you.
Do I look like a ripper, Stefan?
I've said repeatedly that the hope of being reunited with my family is enough to overcome the urges.
Lily, you either come with me right now, or you're out of my life.
I'm sorry.
Malcolm, are you here, sweetheart?
What did you give Kai?
Freaky, right?
I turned myself into one of Lily's heretics.
It's really incredible actually.
I can literally siphon the magic of my vampirism and convert it into more magic.
Bad doggie.
I have to find humor in this, Matt, because the alternative...
What's wrong?
What is that?
I found it in the kitchen.
This message will self-destruct in 10 seconds.
Anyhoo, you're probably wondering why you're still alive since I should have bled you out one painful ounce at a time.
You left me behind in 1903, which I did not appreciate, but I guess you forgot about that old Canadian rock filled with Bennett blood.
What is this?
Keep watching.
I am in a very volatile place right now, and I will start beheading people that I don't like, starting with you, if she doesn't wake up.
So what did you do to my damn girlfriend?
And she'll stay that way until she wakes.
Young, beautiful human Elena Gilbert, preserved in this moment indefinitely.
Oh, my God.
You have to get out town now, Bon.
I'm not letting Kai win.
Bon, Elena's the only thing that Damon Salvatore cares about.
Damon, think about it.
I thought it would be fitting considering.
Because you're a weak human again?
You knew that I never wanted to be a vampire, even before we took our first steps up that mountain.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that you knew me better than anyone.
Don't.
I can't do this, not... not now, not ever.
- Where's Damon?
Stefan, this whole thing with Elena, if they can't break the spell, are you gonna be ok?
- Are you?
I don't think Elena necessarily came into my life to be my soul mate.
I mean, she was.
and she reminded me that I used to believe that about him, too, and her faith in him, it brought Damon and me back together, and, yeah, I...
I'm sure it sounds like I'm making a million excuses, but you and I...
Anyone still alive, hmm?
Anyone alive, just raise your hand.
I need blood.
You need more than blood.
You know what's funny?
I didn't even know werewolves were real until I got bit by one.
The thing is, Bon, the only way a guy turns into a wolf is if it's magic, right, so technically, their venom's magic, too.
So I just went ahead and siphoned it up.
How bad is it?
He won, Elena.
What are you gonna do?
She dies of a collapsed lung, no blood on your hands, and you and Elena get to live the life you always dreamed of.
Either way, you better act quick.
I'm so sorry, Bonnie.
That's it?
He just left you?
The whole point was that this would torture him for a while.
Heads it is.
You think I was gonna leave you all alone, huh?
Come on.
It's easy, Bon.
Are we seriously having a sleepover?
Take care of everyone while I'm gone, ok?
I will.
Promise me something, both of you.
Now it's my turn to do it for you.
I just have one more favor to ask.
So I'm a cop, huh?
That's my hope for you, Matt.
My hope is that you spend the rest of your life fighting for people like you.
You know, there's a good chance that I'll never see you again.
You have to let yourself drown in it, but then eventually, you'll start to swim, and every single breath that you fight for will make you stronger.
And I promise that you will beat it.
I'm sorry.
I was happy.
So where are we in this vision of yours?
You need to get out of here, Tyler.
You need to figure out what it is you want to do, who you want to be, and then just really fight for it.
Just be happy.
You must think me such a monster.
We're all monsters in some way, I suppose.
I can because I've been searching for that my whole life.
What is it?
You think she'll be safe here?
If word gets out that her body has the cure inside, every vampire who wants to be a human will come busting in through that door.
Bonnie will spell it shut.
We're under strict orders not to open it for anyone.
I knew that the love of my life would stand by his best friend even if it meant having to live without me for a little while.
Things are gonna be awfully dull around here without you.
No, they're not, Damon, because you're not gonna sit around waiting for me.
I was thinking of doing the starvation diet because desiccation makes the time go faster.
Damon, this isn't gonna work if you just shut down.
I need you to live your life, enjoy yourself.
Yesterday, you told me you made a list of all the ways that loving me has ruined your life, and I get it.
You were by my side when I needed a friend.
You made me laugh, you made me dance.
Are you ready for this?
Ready to spend the next 60 years of my life without you in it?
Who's ever gonna be ready for that?
I love you, Damon Salvatore.
I love you, too.
What did they do to us?
- We know who it is.
Some of those toys in Ali's room were hers 'but some of them were his.'
Who is Charles DiLaurentis?
And that other girl is down there too, Sara Harvey.
What about Andrew?
We're not just saying it, it's reality.
Reality's been through a lot, and so have we.
Makes me sick just thinking about it.
So when do we tell the police about Charles?
- Not gonna happen.
Do your job.
They'll catch that pervert Campbell and that'll be the end of it.
It's been a very long day.
The important thing is you're safe.
Maybe.
Who is Charles DiLaurentis?
What?
Not what, who?
Do we have a Charles DiLaurentis in our family?
No.
No Charles DiLaurentis in this family.
Well, then I guess that person made a mistake.
I'm not asleep.
Who are you?
I'm Emily.
We talked on the phone.
She cried.
How did you end up there?
I ran away.
'I was... in a parking lot near Rosewood.'
'Then I was down there.'
We tracked him all over Tyler Park finally flushed him out.
Are you sure he's the one?
We've been chasing him since we found the prison van at his uncle's farm.
They traced all that electronic gear to him.
Actual, real sleep.
I haven't had that in a long time.
I just wanted to stop in Sara's room and say goodbye.
Can't imagine why I'd need that.
I thought I'd stay for a couple nights.
Yeah, it would be good.
Your father is dealing with the police.
Spencer, you know you've had some issues.
I can't believe that you did this.
It wasn't an easy decision.
Okay, that makes me feel a lot better.
I will help you any way I can, but I'm not gonna take the chance of you having another problem.
- Mom, I need that prescription.
'I'm sorry if that sounds unfair' but I have to be firm on this and so do you.
Ali, I'm gonna say this is delicately as I can.
For getting us out of that place.
You'd have done the same for me.
Did I remember to thank you for saving my life?
I'm still waiting for that thank you card in the mail though.
Yeah, I'm still just looking for the right one.
You were there a lot longer.
What is wrong with you?
Don't you at least wanna look at some paint chips see what you might want?
Not just the wallpaper, everything.
Are you gonna help me or not?
No more sleeping on Mrs. Granville's couch.
Nice, civic-minded lady, but those Hummel figurines kept staring at me.
I saw you, I just wanted check in.
We haven't spoken since the other night.
Been busy.
Pleasure.
I spoke to Spencer this morning.
Good.
They went through a lot.
We all did.
How you doin'?
I'm glad it's over.
Me too.
So we can either sell it or give it away.
'I understand.'
But it's, you know too late to have a yard sale tonight.
Why don't you get a good night's sleep and we can talk about this in the morning?
Uh, the bed is already kind of in the hall, actually.
You can sleep with me, but the furniture, we can...
Don't look at him, look at me.
I want to get rid of some old furniture.
He called to tell me how happy he was to see you again.
I promise you, you're not gonna figure out the next one.
That is not a rule in this house, that is the law.
Emily, do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
I did talk to her.
She said she wanted to come back.
I told her not to.
She deserves to be happy.
I will.
- I don't wanna do that.
- They're your friends.
Doesn't mean I have to see them every second of every day.
What kind of games?
Truth or dare.
Who do you love more, me or her?
Who deserves water today, you or somebody else?
You decide or you lose your turn and somebody else gets to pick.
Lots and lots of games.
This is your room.
Anything you want, baby.
How could a high school boy afford all of that?
One of the things we'd like to know and so would the IRS.
I'll do anything to help.
At any point in the time you were held hostage did you actually see Andrew Campbell?
Yeah, we saw him, but he was masked.
He told me how much he hated Mona.
'He was always around when something happened' 'when my brother was attacked.'
I mean, it was Andrew that was in my house pretending to help us so he could watch us.
'Ultimately, that could decide' if he walks away or pays for what he's done.
Where?
When I was down there.
I, um, I saw him without his mask.
You just said he was always masked.
That was a mistake but I remember now.
Was anyone else with you when you saw his face?
No, I was alone.
I saw him.
I'm helpin' buildin' the case against Andrew.
How's that going?
It's lookin' pretty strong.
The manifesto, the van, the electronics at the farm.
I've been thinking about all that.
Well, A is for arrogance.
When I caught Andrew, I wanted to take him apart because of what he did to you.
All I could think about was you in that place.
I remember you.
It was nice seein' a familiar face.
In church.
Yeah, that's how it was for me.
I like the music.
Yeah, the music's great.
Hey, don't worry.
About what?
I won't tell anybody I saw you in church.
You just said I couldn't use dad's, so I rented a gun.
Dad's defending people, why can't I defend us?
Because this has nothing to do with defending anything and you know it.
It was a little bit longer than that.
After a while there wasn't any time anymore.
I did.
She was down there for years.
And you could see that in her eyes.
What would have happened if I'd been down there for years?
Emily, the person who did this is behind bars.
'I know.'
It made it worse.
It makes you the same as what you're afraid of.
I mean, there were whole parts of my brain that were trying to stop me from lying and the stupid parts won.
Yeah, well, the stupid brain is small, but it's wily.
I might as well have opened the cell door and let Andrew walk out.
I know, well, thanks for coming over.
Yeah, thank you for calling me.
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
So Hanna called and she thinks that we should all go to school tomorrow.
At least now my mom can have her privacy back.
How's it feel?
Well, like I'm about to be boxed and shipped.
But you can try it.
You're the bravest person I've ever met.
It's not true, but I like the sound of it.
It is true.
How is that gonna happen when I'm having a hard time looking them in the eye?
'You will.'
That's what people do, they mend.
You taught me that.
'And sometimes you end up stronger at the broken places.'
Do you know what I want?
I'm sure Toby, he's told you plenty about me.
Would you like one of these little hamburgers?
Well, I think you just did.
Do you wanna talk about it?
Oh, I think I've said enough, don't you?
I've done enough damage, talking.
I'm just gonna stick to the visuals from now on.
The police talked to us after they brought you out of that place.
Aria, you're very smart.
I ran away.
Maybe it was just really hard for her to show you because you were gone so long.
They paid attention to her.
Then I came home and I spoiled everything.
Well, no one's goin' anywhere tonight.
You can stay, Sara, but we've gotta call your mother.
You can try.
We're gonna get some justice now.
I saw him on TV.
What are you doin'?
I can't believe you went home.
Spencer, I'm a drug and alcohol abuse counselor.
Wait, wait!
Or maybe I have.
- 'It was right next to the.... '
- Spencer, I do not wanna....
Aria, please, just help me.
'It is bad enough I can't even walk by the photo lab.... '
What did you do with that hair dye?
Huh, you're giving me cramps.
Aria, we can't just throw away clues.
What're you eating?
Well, why don't you just say yes?
Because it's a pity toss, that's why.
When did you get back?
Late last night.
I just saw your mom as she was leaving for work.
She introduced me to that cop parked at your curb.
What's with the shades?
- Is that cop really here 24/7?
They stand outside the bathroom while you pee.
I wish we'd never come back here.
Well, did you feel any safer at the spa?
There's no way she's not plotting some kind of revenge.
You've got bigger worries than Alison.
They might still press charges against me for being dead when I wasn't.
Well, that's not a crime, that's just being stupid.
No, Han, when there's a full-on investigation that costs the taxpayers more than our new sewer system it's a crime.
And I don't think I'll have any cops looking out for me.
We have to track down anyone who ever had any contact with Charles DiLaurentis.
Someone who worked at Radley has got to know something!
- I'm betting their father.
- He's no help.
Alison is so embarrassed she only leaves her house nowadays to go to church.
Don't get all judge-y.
Well, will you at least drop me off at the precinct before school?
I can't go in there alone.
'She hasn't left the house since yesterday...' '....unless she dug a tunnel.'
Mom, I-I can't talk to you when you're like this.
I'll call you later.
Does she think that she can make some money off of what happened to you?
Probably.
But I have to deal with her.
Or you could stop dealing with her all together.
Have you ever thought about getting legally emancipated?
- I'm a psychic.
That or you told me you'd be working in your dad's office today.
I mean my portfolio's starting to look like one of those calendars the bank hands out for free.
I was thinking of taking a ride out to a junkyard on Route 47.
Wanna come?
Well, don't go into an early retirement, girl.
It's exactly the type of work they're looking for.
Who's looking for?
Didn't we talk about the contest?
The Cardillo Fellowship, it's a cash prize and a summer internship at a magazine.
Yeah, I know it ain't Rosewood but there are things worth photographing there too.
And you can do it in flip-flops.
Good luck with your work.
Why are you out here?
I just needed some air.
If you're going stir-crazy you can come with me to the office.
Do your homework in the conference room no one will bother you.
I'm fine here.
I can always wear earplugs.
I overheard one of Rosewood's finest dissing me to another cop.
Well, what?
I'd let it go.
Lesli?
I made the mistake of complementing a stranger on her Dolce Gabbana stretch pants.
'And now, everything that I have worked for' my fellowship, my teaching position, my reputation they're all in jeopardy 'because I actually saw you as the victim.'
Sorry, I forgot the champagne.
You think I actually wanted perjury on my resume?
I don't know what that means but I really don't like your tone.
Lesli, I'm sorry about all this, I swear.
"You're the one who testified against me." Am I wrong?
That's a really long time to wait.
Wait for what?
I didn't say anything, I just smiled.
Well, your cup may runneth over, but mine is bone dry.
- Who's that?
- Mona.
Hell no, Lesli is a freaking lunatic who needs a serious reality check.
Spencer, we can't have Mona quaking in her boots when we need that boot to kick the doors down at Radley.
I mean, I'm not going back to that shredding place and Mona knows Radley more than any of us.
It's not your cookie.
Okay, first you're sexting Toby like some dog in heat and then you're gumming at your dessert like my grandma.
The subject is Charles, and it's not gonna be easy breaking into Radley with or without Mona.
Are you buzzed?
You have the same look in your eyes as this girl in my government class who hums and makes chokers out of paper clips.
Well, Dr. Oz says sex is a drug too, Spencer.
Maybe you should figure that one out.
I had a smelly apartment and a major fruit-fly problem but other than that it was okay.
What are you doing?
Sorry, uh, the shadow was across your face and I just couldn't help myself.
In honor of us diving into things that scare us .would you be up to having dinner with me tonight?
This past year has been really difficult and without having.... to go into all the details....
I apologize.
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
You're not scared of being in the woods after sundown, are you?
No, I have been in the woods.
They're watching out for you, Alison.
You're not the person they're trying to catch.
Look, if you don't wanna do it....
Seriously?
Well, there were a few people who didn't say, "Yay", right away but I took advantage of the silence.
I really believe you can make a difference with these kids.
That's not what I told you.
The last time I checked, this was still my house.
Goodbye, Lorenzo.
I mean, I babysat for my neighbors' kids.
That, uh, that may not be enough.
Caleb, she was 14 when she ran away from home.
No, but they do expect her to have a job where she can support herself and a high school diploma.
- We should go.
Yeah, and that's how I know it's not an easy process.
Sorry.
Okay, I may have gone a little overboard.
I've got over eight rolls in here.
No, they look great.
'The guy that I met in the Hollis photo lab.'
We-we went to a junkyard to take some pictures and I'm pretty sure that A followed us there.
And Clark got A on camera?
By accident, but I-I can't examine the negatives without looking like a freak, so maybe I should just tell him what's going on and that way....
Why don't you just print the photos out and we'll look at them.
'They're not mine, Em.'
I gotta go.
Give them my number.
What are you gonna say?
That she works for me at my web design company.
You're willing to cover for her?
You start tomorrow.
Hey, Lesli, it's Hanna again.
Look, before we do this, can I just say one thing?
You are not the source of my anger.
And it would be great if you could too.
That.... may not happen overnight.
That person hasn't been caught yet.
That nut house may have closed down but it still holds all the answers.
Answers to what?
I thought the police.... ask the questions.
Taking matters into your own hands is exactly what got your friend Mona into trouble in the first place.
Ready to hit the road?
We're all good.
Well, she's mellowed out a bit since then.
Oh, I doubt it.
Look, I haven't been to a meeting in a while.
And it was just for some reassurance.
I thought it was the free food.
But when you've been yanked out of one nightmare and then shoved into another....
Yeah, but you're strong, Spencer .stronger than you think.
Please.... just don't say that.
Can you do me a favor?
Can you throw that out?
Thank you.
It's a card for Alison.
I know it's totally retro, but e-mails can be deleted and she would never take my calls, so...
You look great, Spencer.
Much better than the last time I saw you.
I was on a hospitalgurney.
Yeah, me too, but you looked more graceful being rolled.
Mona.... can I ask you something?
Not Sara Harvey, but a-a younger girl maybe 11 or 12.
Why are you asking me this?
I-I-I have this image in my head of a young girl.
She looks a lot like a young Alison and she's .guiding me towards this creepy room with these rusted bathtubs.
I think that everyone that was trapped in that place escaped, Spencer.
It's got a couple of drains on the floor and the walls are tiled, there's broken furniture everywhere and God knows what horrible things happened down there.
It is.
Maybe it doesn't exist.
I think it must live in your head.
She said it would take a while for my PFE to go through, but .that I could stay with you and your mom in the meantime.
Okay, we have to do something special tonight.
How do you want to celebrate your freedom?
Let's make it permanent.
'We're not leaving here 'until we find something about Charles.'
God, what did they keep down here?
Only the staff was allowed in the basement, not us.
I thought she was supposed to be our tour guide.
God, why are all these doors locked?
Spence, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Wait, that door's open.
Thanks.
And if my mom ever found out I got a tattoo, she'd harpoon me.
What does this one mean?
That is the Japanese symbol for courage.
Could you hold my phone?
It's just really tender.
Well, it ain't gonna hurt any less with a needle in it.
Um, how about something a little closer to the good china?
What's it say?
Yeah, he's dead.
- What am I looking at?
Hanna, you can't donate your heart, liver and both kidneys and still play Boggle in the Radley rec room, he's dead.
Well, someone is pretending to be him, so who is it?
What are you doing?
- Don't touch it.
- Why would I touch it?
No, you blow into it, they use it to teach CPR.
What was that?
It's probably something you woke out of hibernation with your screaming.
I totally could have dropped this off at church.
Why make you leave your house if you don't have to?
He's angry with himself.
He failed to protect his own family and .that's gotta hurt.
Well, it wouldn't hurt us as much if he'd just admit it.
I got the goon who was on your beat to trade shifts with another officer.
You didn't have to do that.
I wanted to.
We should probably call my mom, let her know we're on our way.
- Sara, what's wrong?
What text?
When we went to Caleb's apartment .there was someone across the street in a black hoodie.
I don't need any more proof he's dead.
We knew that already, but we don't know who Charles was close to, who he hung out with.
Let's go.
Please, don't do this.
Why didn't you want me to know?
I need to protect myself.
What the hell Mona?
No, you're gonna explain right now.
Why were you stealing your file, Mona?
She wasn't.
Lesli was a patient here too?
Yes, and she doesn't want it to go public.
Is that how you met her?
What are you talking about?
That's a bust and it's Leslie Stone's.
I mean, taking us down in a courtroom is not the same as taking us down to that bunker.
Because she's unstable, that's why.
They were roommates and probably pretty close.
Lesli must think that we helped Ali kill Bethany that night and then dumped her body in that pit.
We still have no idea who bashed her over the head and Lesli doesn't know any of it.
Mona said she was doing it to repair their friendship.
Okay, so what do we do now?
Well, we know where she lives.
I did everything I could, Lesli, I swear.
Mona, what are you trying to say?
They know.
You can still celebrate that night in a quiet, more intimate way.
Veronica's offered to host a small gathering in the backyard barn.
Alison went to prom.
Our recipients are ultimately chosen by my employer.
Would that be Mr. Carissimi?
Okay, you couldn't pick that even if you tried.
Emily, this is Ali's phone.
Please don't do this!
We may have a visual of the suspect on the roof.
I'll do whatever it takes to help you.
I said stand down!
Don't do this to your sister.
Nobody's home.
Guys, we promised Toby that we would stay here until he escorted us out, remember?
Charles drove his car through my house, Aria, okay?
I believe he'll hurt anybody who gets in his way.
Guys we're not alone in here.
Hey, Aria, there's no way out of here.
God, Mona, you scared the crap out of us.
Aria, maybe you thought he was always happy to see you, but I could never get past the bulge in his pants.
What is that?
I started snarfing Alison ever since she came back to town.
I couldn't get a lock on where he was so I coded a program to decrypt 'the signal source and... '
Charles has his own cellular network 'and the servers are located at... '
Em, where are you going?
Why are the cops here?
Wait, you don't think that's Ali's chopped-up body in those bags, is it?
What is in those bags?
And why are they moving them in the middle of the night?
Try his birthday.
Do you seriously think we can outsmart A?
Uh, try Mrs. D.'s, 12-18.
Wait, you know Mrs. D.'s birthday?
I'm a self-taught eidetiker.
It's just a stupid room.
Yeah, but A's not stupid.
Did we just walk inside A's brain?
I think he knows we're here.
This is a live feed.
'It's Alison.'
Where is she?
Why would you kill them?
We're family.
Who is she talking to?
Don't be so dramatic, Ali.
They're not dead... yet.
You gave me a passport and a plane ticket.
I'd hardly call that everything.
It was all that I had.
If you keep making this about you, Ali it's gonna be a long night and we don't have much time.
What is she planning?
Wait, so CeCe is Charles?
Sh-she is a she, right?
How do you think CeCe escaped police custody?
Sara called Tanner directly, right?
What, wait, you think Tanner is working for CeCe?
Yeah, and I bet she told Sara that we're all just fine.
You were like my very own living doll.
And when my dolly was sad it made me sad too.
Do you know what makes me feel better?
Shh, Ali, it's okay.
What's wrong with you?
I love you more, mommy.
This wasn't the first time, Jess.
We're doing the right thing.
We can't risk him harming Jason or the baby.
But it was an accident.
He had to have known that.
Oh, I'm sure he did.
I don't understand.
For as long as I can remember I asked mom to buy me dresses.
But dad found out... and...
You never visited me.
Not even once.
Thank God neither of us inherited the bastard's beady eyes.
That's what CeCe did to me.
My brain kept telling me to scream but my-my body couldn't move.
Jason and Mr. D. are living a nightmare they can't wake up from.
Mom came to visit me as often as she could.
'Aunt Carol came a couple of times.'
But... for the next seven years at Radley I was almost completely alone.
That must have been awful.
You think?
When I turned twelve mom bought me this beautiful yellow dress for Christmas.
'And after that, every time she would buy you clothes... ' ...she would buy me the same outfit.
Almost like we were twins.
You're beautiful.
Absolutely stunning.
Thanks, Bethany.
Wish we could find a way out of here.
Leaving's easy, Charles.
It's staying gone that would be tough.
My mom always says that nothing's more believable than a really good lie.
Like we got lost in the woods and we were raised by a pack of wolves.
Amateur.
Does it look like I could survive in the woods?
You're too pretty for that.
Please don't make me talk about it anymore.
It's too painful.
'Oh, it's that goody two-shoes, Mrs. Cavanaugh.'
Bethany, what did you do?
What did I do?
You pushed her... freak.
No one believed the boy wearing the dress.
I had the most to lose, so they thought I pushed her.
Even mom?
She paid off Wilden to make sure Marion's death was ruled a suicide.
All this time, he thought she chose to leave him.
That changed him.
Mrs. D. sacrificed Toby for Charles.
Now we know who taught A how to treat people like dolls.
Mr. D. abandoned him but Mrs. D. taught Charles how to be A.
After that the doctors gave me a new diagnosis.
Intermittent explosive disorder.
Why is that funny?
Who died?
We buried him... at Aunt Carol's.
- What is it?
There's another one?
I thought Ali and CeCe were the only two Red Coats.
So who's that?
What is she doing with those trash cans?
'That's not trash.'
That's why she's telling us her story that's how she's gonna end it.
CeCe's gonna blow up Radley.
I couldn't trust anyone after Bethany.
So I found a way to escape Radley without ever leaving.
Mom.
Oh, I have some fantastic news.
They're letting me out?
Well, sort of.
The board has granted you permission to attend classes at UPenn.
Now, now, don't cry.
I'm very proud of you.
I thought going to school would be fun but I already knew most of what they were teaching.
One day, classes were cancelled...
Okay, I called in a bomb threat.
I knew it was a risk but I needed to see my family.
Rude much?
Sorry, I, uh...
'Next, please.'
Do you even go to school here?
- Did you guys...
- Okay, that's just sick, Ali.
Like I said, it's my brother.
And who could blame him?
I mean, look at me.
'I can't believe mom was okay with this.'
Mom didn't know CeCe was Charlotte until the day we left for Cape May.
How could you risk everything you've worked so hard for?
If they find out, he'll kill me.
So all this time, you've been pretending to go to school while you're running around Rosewood with my children?
I'm your child too.
I just wanted to be with my family.
Jason asked your father if he could bring his girlfriend to the cape, he's on his way home now to meet you.
What would happen if he found out about me?
Mom, what would happen if he found out about me?
He thinks you're dead.
You told him that grave was real?
Whoa, all this time I thought you did that for me but you did that for you.
I lied to him so that you could finally be you.
He never would have allowed it.
This is CeCe.
She was on the porch when I pulled up.
She's lovely, Jason.
So nice to meet you.
But that bitch, Bethany, she ruined everything.
She found out mom was having an affair with her dad and she lost it.
She stole my clothes, she knew I had out privileges and she snuck out of Radley.
She was gonna hurt mom.
I swear, I thought it was Bethany.
I swear, I didn't know it was Ali, mom.
Mona, are you okay?
I killed Bethany.
But if CeCe hit Ali...
Bethany had blond hair, and she was dressed just like Alison.
I killed an innocent person.
Bethany wasn't innocent.
Jason told Emily that he saw you that night wearing my yellow top.
You found her on the highway, outside of Radley.
That's all anybody needs to know.
I was never in Rosewood tonight, ma'am.
And neither was your daughter.
They're never gonna let me out again.
Maybe that's for the best.
Maybe dad was right about me.
I'll understand if you never wanna see me again.
Let's just give it some time.
I thought it would take a long time for mom to forgive me.
It never occurred to me that she never totally would.
'She's never made a bad investment.'
'No one found out I was in Rosewood that night.'
But the doctors at Radley knew I flew the coop so... they took away my out privileges and I was alone again.
And then the craziest girl showed up.
She was so drugged up that in the beginning she thought I was you.
I did everything you asked me to.
You're getting better.
Just keep taking your meds.
I need to know everything.
'I was so bummed when they started' 'weaning Mona off her meds.'
Hearing about what she did to those bitches was, like, the only thing I looked forward to.
So Mona did know it was you?
I stopped visiting her before she snapped out of her drugdaze.
I could never trust Mona.
I really am sorry.
And she was like Houdini getting in and out of places.
It was like Bethany said, leaving wasn't hard.
But I needed Mona's help to stay gone.
And my first assignment was making friends in Rosewood.
Take it from me you're always better off with a really good lie.
Is it just me or did that sound a lot like Alison?
You were friends of Ali's?
You should have seen the look on those girls' faces.
Oh, it was worth a million bucks.
So why did you move back to Rosewood?
Listen, I hate to make tracks, but I'm already late and my boss is high-strung and aggressively sober.
Come visit me at the new boutique across the street.
Oh, and if you ever feel like doing a little free shopping I'd be happy to turn the other away.
'Mona told me those bitches were happy' that you were gone.
And that, oh that really, really pissed me off.
I mean those girls were supposed to be your friends.
They got what they deserved.
And it got me really excited about playing the game again.
I knew if you were alive you'd show up if the girls were in trouble.
They all thought you were flying the plane that night.
Sara Harvey was the other Red Coat?
And that night, she was supposed to keep Mona busy while I trapped the girls.
Oh, it was the perfect plan.
Then Shana showed up and all hell broke loose.
Did anyone see her?
See who?
'No, you're hallucinating.'
I saw her too.
So did I.
I knew I wasn't crazy.
You really were alive.
If you really cared about me why did you keep playing the game?
When your friends thought they killed A in New York it was the perfect time to end it.
I left the country thinking it was over.
And it felt great to succeed at something.
You attacked me in my own living room.
You were gonna leave, and I couldn't lose you again.
I-I had to make it seem real so you'd pay attention.
I'm not a bad person, Ali.
You almost froze Aria and Spencer to death.
You can't steal people from their families and lock them up to play with them like they're your toys.
Yes, I can, and I did.
I know you won't believe me but I love all of my dolls.
That's why you're still alive.
I would never let anything really bad happen to them.
Are you talking about Wilden?
He found out you were alive.
Wilden was never gonna let you come back and tell your story.
Who is that?
You saw the body, right?
Tell me he can never hurt my sister again.
Wilden's dead.
Sorry, Emily... but not really.
Shut it off!
We all saw Sara when they brought her out of the dollhouse.
Are we supposed to think that that was an act?
That's why Tanner is not here.
'Get us the hell out of here.'
There's no way to open this door.
A always has an escape plan.
'Hey, one of these is not like the others.'
Are you making yourself comfortable?
Hanna, be careful.
We will.
Mom was the only person who ever really loved me.
Get out of here!
Damn it.
Don't even think about it.
She's headed to the roof!
We may have a visual of the suspect on the roof.
No!
Charlotte, please don't do this!
Game over.
Wow, you bring enough flip-flops, Em?
It's Malibu.
I, uh, heard that Sara got released from the hospital today.
What happened to Sara that night wasn't our fault.
I doubt that's how she sees it.
Well, saying goodbye is a lot harder than I thought it would be.
You gonna be okay?
He's coming for you.
Good gracious.
Richard, you look positively ghastly.
Babe, you keep saying that, and it keeps getting worse.
About when I went missing, I think.
And so why didn't you want to tell me about it?
Probably because I didn't want to make a big deal of it.
- I don't think you should ignore this.
Look, a-at least consider seeing someone.
I know somebody who may be able to help.
Have you ever sought therapy before, Mr. Castle?
Well, if you'd met my mother, you'd know the answer would be yes, but, uh, by my nature, I try to avoid introspection.
Well, let's get started.
What can you tell me about your missing time?
Not much.
The last thing I remember, I was driving to my wedding.
Two months later, they found me in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.
And you said you didn't want to remember.
We went to great lengths to make sure that you didn't.
I-I've tried to put it behind me, but it haunts me.
Is it possible my memories are coming back?
Hypnosis?
You have a pen and paper if you wish to take notes.
You may open your eyes and awaken at any time.
Go back to the first image you can recall of your dream.
What do you see?
Long time, Rick.
For some kind of sport?
Now someone's firing a pistol.
I see blood.
There's a man on the floor.
I'm there, too.
Can you see where you are right now?
In a storage shed.
But it seems like everything is moving.
I'm in a truck.
We're in the jungle.
And there's someone chasing us.
They're shooting at us.
There's a blond man in a truck.
He's leading the charge.
Uh, Dr. Burke, can I, uh... can I see you again tomorrow?
Well, I'll check, but I want you to think about the underlying meaning of the dream.
Now, don't assume that the images are actual memories.
We'll know more when we track down that Chuck Norris look-alike.
How do you plan on doing that?
We'll see what we can find out.
But it's a long shot at best.
I know this seems impossible.
A lot of our cases do at first.
There's something there, Castle, so we'll just follow it and see where it leads.
I got something on that license plate.
That the license plate was registered in Chiang Mai, a province in northern Thailand.
I was in Thailand, getting shot at with Chuck Norris?
Kate, are you awake?
What's... what's wrong?
He's kind of gone off the deep end about Thailand.
I'm, uh, researching armed conflicts in northern Thailand during the time I was missing.
Somehow, I must have been part of one of them.
But, Castle, why would you be abducted on our wedding day and end up in Thailand?
Worst bachelor party ever?
Eh, the trophy's irrelevant.
Well, it was in your dream for a reason.
You said it was familiar.
I know what it is.
- Why would that be in your dream?
- I don't know, but...
Wait a minute.
We shared this trophy.
That man in my dream, the one who says hello, it was him.
Long time, Rick.
He's a part of this.
Okay, so now it's Chuck Norris and some old buddy from high school?
Look, Castle needs to know what's going on.
What if these leads go nowhere?
Then he needs to know that, as well.
I don't know.
It's possible the plate was stolen, or...
Or what?
I ran an image search of the plate.
Richard is completely obsessed, and I am concerned about him.
I think looking into this is a bad idea.
Martha, I-I don't think that this is a choice for him.
I think that he needs to know the truth.
What if he never finds out the truth?
And I promise you I am not gonna let him go too far.
Long time, Rick.
Long time, Rick.
You were expecting my call?
As long as you tell me your version of what happened.
I can't do that.
I need to know what you know.
I was in Thailand to attend an investment conference.
We hit this Bangkok nightclub.
Oh, she was so beautiful.
Wait, what?
It doesn't make any sense.
Except we checked him out.
I even called Faircroft Prep.
They confirmed Phillip Bartlett was not on the debate team.
I didn't share first place with anyone.
Uh, babe, maybe you're taking this whole dream thing too literally.
Uh, sir, I was following up on some new leads about Castle's disappearance.
I dug into that tattoo.
None of those guys look like Chuck Norris.
You don't believe me, do you?
For my money, your story about the missing two months never added up.
It still doesn't.
This is just the kind of guy who could be a mercenary in Thailand.
Jeff Powers?
Just wanted to ask you a few questions.
That's him.
That's the guy in my dream.
But I'll know more once I do a full workup on him.
Well, I was hoping to prove Castle's story was true, but not like this.
Let's find out what Jeff Powers was into.
Easier said than done.
His parents are dead, no wife or siblings.
Yeah, well, I never thought you were.
Well, I sure thought I was.
You must have had a few moments of doubt.
Do we have any idea who killed him?
What if it's my fault?
What if me poking around is what got him killed?
Castle, how could that even be possible?
Well, I may know more in 20 minutes.
You mean your appointment with Dr. Burke?
It could be where he was last night before he came home and wound up dead.
He's nice, always a gentleman.
Fact is, he was there last night, right?
Was he there with somebody?
Jeff wasn't much for socializing.
He came in looking for Jeff.
He was in town, visiting, and wanted to surprise him, so he made me swear not to say anything.
When was this?
Three days ago, maybe?
Amber, this army buddy of Jeff's... do you think you remember this guy well enough to help us out with a sketch?
It's not working.
I-I-I can't remember anything new.
I keep coming up with the same images.
Let's look at this another way.
Perhaps the images came to you for a reason.
- Something triggered them.
And then?
I wrote for a while.
I wanted a change of scenery, so I took my laptop to the coffee shop...
There.
What did you just remember?
Let's go back a week ago to the coffee shop.
What were you doing when this buzzing first started?
Or recognized?
No.
No, I don't think so.
What was playing?
Something from the local news.
But, on the bright side, many post offices will be open extra late to accept tax returns from last-minute filers.
It's just some report on tax day.
There's got to be something else there.
What is it?
Tory, zoom in on that man right there.
I know him.
He was in Thailand.
The same man.
First in Thailand, now in New York.
Whoever he is, he's at the center of this.
Just catching a glimpse of his face is what started all this.
Uh, he was dressed like a soldier.
So European, maybe.
I'll run his photo through Interpol, see if they know him.
And I'll have unis canvass where that video was taken and see if anyone in that neighborhood recognizes him.
Thanks, guys.
Okay, what else can we do?
What you need to do is go back to the loft and stay there.
Now, I've assigned a security detail to you.
But he was shooting at you in Thailand.
And he just killed Jeff Powers, your Chuck Norris look-alike.
Now, Lt. is gonna drive you home.
And if I refuse?
Then he'll drive you home in handcuffs.
I'll call you if we find anything.
Well, for one thing, Mr. Powers' blood work came back.
He had antibodies for dengue fever.
Just like Castle.
What happened to his teeth?
Or the killer wanted information.
Did he leave any evidence behind?
I'm afraid not.
Looks like he wore latex gloves.
I found traces of talc in the victim's mouth.
They could have his prints or DNA on them.
Right, but those gloves could be anywhere.
Call the K-9 unit, have them deploy bloodhounds to search near Powers' apartment building.
Thanks.
Yeah, not with my team either.
I hope you're wrong about that.
'Cause if our killer was after information, he may think Castle has it.
I wanted to be here with you.
I know this isn't just another case.
What really went on in Thailand, dad?
I know you must have a theory.
Uh, believe me, I have dozens.
Which one scares you the most?
I don't need you to protect me.
I'm not a kid anymore.
I'm not afraid to hear the truth.
Why not let me in?
I wanted to forget everything.
So in my darkest moments, I wonder if I... did something terrible.
I know you.
You would never do anything bad.
I could never leave the love of my life, desert her and you for two months.
And somehow I did.
How did we ID this guy?
By way of a bloodhound named Cujo.
Cujo sniffed out a paper bag in a storm drain about four blocks away from the crime scene.
The bag contained latex gloves.
In any case, CSU was able to pull prints.
We got a hit off ECRIS, European fingerprint network.
Ilya Golovkin.
Since then, word is that he's been responsible for over two dozen assassinations.
Including politicians, dissident journalists, protected witnesses, even a Vatican banker.
Golovkin's the guy you call when you have a job that no one else can do.
Castle, if Golovkin is involved, then whatever's going on, whatever you were a part of, it's something big.
Here you go.
How do we even track down a guy like Golovkin?
We called in reinforcements.
We're coordinating with the FBI.
Every state and federal law-enforcement agency is looking for this guy.
And when we find him, you will have your answers.
He's the only person who knows the truth.
There's at least one other person who knows.
I need to see Powers' file.
Exactly what are you hoping to find?
We already went over what little there is on Powers.
Jenkins is the mastermind behind this, or mastermind-adjacent.
Castle, we could never locate Jenkins, much less find his real name.
But maybe now we can.
A transit cop thinks he just saw Golovkin get off a subway stop at Sheridan Square.
Castle, stay put, okay?
He might still be there.
Okay, go.
Detectives, over here.
That's Amber, the stripper.
Golovkin must have questioned her.
Now he knows we're onto him.
Bringing her here was his way of rubbing our faces in it.
Yeah, but what's his angle?
What's he after?
I don't know, but whatever it is, he's not gonna stop until he gets it.
Actually, I'm working with the NYPD.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Have you ever seen this man?
Mr. Jeff... of course.
He's a regular customer here at Sunil's café.
Very regular.
In fact, for the past six months, he's come here, without fail, every Tuesday at 6:00 p.m.
What about this man?
Have you ever seen him or the two of them together?
- I'm sorry.
- Of course.
Thank you for your time.
You should never have come.
If you're here, it means that I'm a dead man.
I thought you already were a dead man.
Where are we going?
What is this place?
They promised me you wouldn't remember.
How did you find me?
He's dead, isn't he?
When?
Who are you calling?
What does that mean?
I know you were in the truck, wounded.
Long before that, I was your friend.
That's the trophy... the one I thought I won with Phil Bartlett.
That's because they had to erase all your memories of me and replace them with somebody else.
You even consulted with me when you wrote your first, uh, Derrick Storm book.
Consulted about what?
Terrorism.
Okay, but how does that explain Jeff Powers?
Why would he come to the restaurant every Tuesday?
And now my cover's blown.
I joined Al-Qaeda.
You were in Al-Qaeda?
Can you please keep your voice down?
Yes, I was.
I rose up to become a part of their senior leadership.
And now you're bussing tables and you live here?
I wanted to leave Al-Qaeda, and I had inside knowledge about that organization.
So I struck a deal with American intelligence to trade what I knew for a second chance.
And what does any of this have to do with me?
How did we end up in that truck?
The Russian had been hunting me, hired by Al-Qaeda.
He finally caught up with me.
That's how you got wounded.
- My ride's here.
- I still have a lot of questions.
In fact, I have the deepest gratitude for everything that you've done.
I just wish I could remember what it was.
As do I.
Come away from the light.
Come.
I know absolutely nothing.
It does not matter.
I thought we had an understanding that you wouldn't pursue this.
That's for making me miss my wedding day.
You have no idea how lucky you are, Mr. Castle.
I'm not at liberty to give you one.
That's why you brought me back from Thailand, minus my memory.
I was gone two months thanks to you.
I missed my wedding.
What couldn't wait one more day?
There was a ticking clock.
We'd picked up chatter about a major Al-Qaeda strike in the U.S.
We knew it was hours away and there was never enough time for us to put the pieces together in order to stop it.
But Bilal knew about the strike.
Names, places, operational details, yeah.
We were desperate for Bilal and his intel.
And when his contact was killed, we needed you to get Bilal.
And he came through.
We were able to prevent the strike, and we neutralized everyone involved.
That's all I can tell you.
And I expect you not to repeat it.
You should leave now, Mr. Castle.
You saved tens of thousands of lives?
If you told us, you'd have to kill us.
You mock, but it is for your own safety.
I guess what really matters is, you found out the truth, dad, and the good news is, it didn't turn out to be your worse-case scenario.
Totally.
- I have to go study.
- See you.
Never soon enough.
I'm just glad that you're okay.
Yeah, well, um, there's no proof of what happened in that alley.
By the time uniforms got there, his body was already gone.
If Jenkins can get rid of memories, getting rid of a body would be child's play.
I am so sorry, Kate, for everything I put you through.
Babe, it's not like you were partying in Thailand.
You have the best excuse ever for missing our wedding.
Why was I gone for two months?
Sara, I was just..
Charlie, don't.
Lorenzo, are you okay?
'Authorities have named Charles DiLaurentis' 'as a lead suspect in the kidnapping' 'of five Rosewood teens' 'as well as a sixth victim from Courtland.'
And maybe someone could put a fist to that face.
Toby says that the highway patrol is setting up checkpoints at all the state borders.
'One of the first responding officers on the scene' 'suffered minor injuries in pursuit of the suspect..'
Ali's mom is practically the only person who visited him, who even knew that Charles existed.
And now everyone else knows it too.
We're probably done watching this, right?
Do you remember anything else?
We hear you, but it's unfair to Ali right now...
Jessica donated her time and money to a lot of causes.
I'm sure her husband will be able to explain.
And you believe this Charles person used that money to give you a scholarship?
Mr. DiLaurentis did not return your phone calls.
He doesn't wanna talk to us, so we should just turn over the money and let him explain it to the police.
Come on, his office is just around the corner.
Well, at least now we know 'where he's hiding.'
If we go over there, they're just gonna turn the cameras on you which is the last thing I want to happen.
We're gonna need to find another way to reach him.
Well, I don't want this money.
You deserve to be able to go to college after all that you've been through.
I just can't imagine facing the person that did that to you.
To be honest, I don't really know what we were thinking.
Well, how do you know he was gonna be there?
On the news, they, um haven't said if this guy sent a message or if it was some kind of trap or anything...
Can we just move on?
Uh, they, um, used one of your photos to advertise.
Well, I figured since you weren't gonna be there tonight you would at least want to see this.
Is that Clark?
I was hoping I'd get a chance to meet him.
Oh, he's just worried about me.
Maybe if I had called the cops earlier.
I wish my mom would get it.
She still doesn't want you to go to the gallery opening tonight?
We're going to Mike's sports banquet.
She convinced my dad that it's better we stay close to home.
That is an excellent idea you just gave me.
Who?
Ever since that night at the arcade the only person he's opening up to about Charles is Tanner.
She needs to know who she's dealing with.
Don't I deserve to know that too?
I just hate that you got hurt.
Hey, your friends could have gotten hurt too.
You tried.
After you eat your soup.
All the healing power goes away when you re-heat homemade soup in the microwave, so..
I can.
You're welcome.
She won't even go to the police until she talks to Mr. D.
Isn't that like withholding evidence or obstruction of justice or something?
I know your mom's hardly violating the omnibus clause.
Look, we don't need forensic accounting, Hanna but we need to figure out if the person signing those checks is actually Charles DiLaurentis.
We haven't even graduated high school yet.
You know, I've always wondered about college credit.
No, Hanna, college credit is..
What if we give the money back?
You have an eye for detail, Aria.
'Every one of these pictures are so..' ...declarative, succinct.
We can even put them in unmarked cars if you don't want undue attention.
Thank you, but, Aria, you know we've already committed to Mike's...
This is my work in a real art gallery.
Are you sure?
I wouldn't agree to it if I felt there was risk involved.
I'm just trying to look out for you.
If you decide to go, I will make sure that we have enough manpower there to keep you all safe.
Hey, there's a jacket in the closet to the right in the back.
The one with the skulls?
Am I that predictable?
Did you text Spencer and Hanna?
Yeah, they said they'll meet us at the gallery.
- What about Ali?
- I haven't heard back.
Well, I don't blame her.
I found it in a vintage store a couple of months ago.
You know that feeling when the perfect dress just speaks to you?
Yeah, I think your wardrobe speaks a lot louder than mine.
- Just want it to be a surprise.
Just hope we all get to wear them.
The memo about side boob and backless gowns?
People have expressed safety concerns, according to Hackett.
Because of what happened at the arcade?
We can all kick in for a limo.
We'll have dinner at Carlo's.
They've that really cute patio with all the twinkle lights.
My dress kinda was made for twinkle lights.
Okay, so if we do this will you be my prom buddy?
Two single ladies, we can buy each other those giant corsages and just go out and have stupid fun.
Oh, and I'll even throw in a couple of slow dances.
You can lead.
I think I might want to slow dance with somebody else.
Who?
Sara?
Are you sure you don't want me to take your number...
Hey, that was really rude.
I wasn't actually thirsty, Spencer.
I was just tryin' to make us look normal.
Hanna, that's not a..
Okay, I think you're being a little bit paranoid..
Hanna, what are you doing?
Hi, you must be Rhys Matthews?
Tanner's been recording her meetings with your father.
Like an interrogation?
What was she asking him?
The tapes and transcripts are off-limits... to me at least.
So my father is definitely talking to her about Charles.
What else can he tell her?
Would you grab me some water, please?
You should probably get outta here for a little bit.
These things are gonna have me knocked out for a while.
No sense in you hanging around watch me drool in my sleep.
Really, I don't mind staying.
Was this the first time you two kissed?
Wait.
Sara doesn't know about the tracking chips, does she?
I didn't feel one on her neck so I figured I shouldn't tell her.
Have you asked her yet to prom?
We make it a group thing, like you said.
But Sara was down there for so long.
And you're okay with goin' solo?
'I mean, it's not 1912.'
You can ask the guy.
I'm sure that Caleb and Toby will throw me a bone and give me one dance.
Besides, I can't think of one guy in the right mind who would say yes if I asked.
Not that I want the extra baggage.
So you received a $30,000 scholarship check deposited it into your college fund and then changed your mind?
My mom applied for these scholarships.
She didn't know that I had a few other options.
And you're confident these other options will fully fund your college tuition?
Totally.
Um, are you able to give it to someone else?
We could help you find another candidate.
We'll most likely return the amount to our scholarship fund until the next round of applications come in.
It's difficult to find your organization on those scholarship websites.
We prefer to offer scholarships selectively.
Most of our candidates are recommended through personal connections.
So who makes the final decision?
Our recipients are ultimately chosen by my employer.
Would that be Mr. Carissimi?
Maybe we could speak with him?
Well, I would just like to thank him.
Maybe I could send him an e-mail or something.
I will alert him to your change of heart the next time we speak.
Daphne, I'll need to see the current holdings report.
It was a pleasure meeting you both.
You couldn't pick that even if you tried.
Besides, what he's hiding isn't in there.
It's in his freaking DNA.
- Exactly like a DiLaurentis.
How else did he have Ali's perfect chin and Jason's perfect hair?
What if this whole Carissimi Group setup is just one big elaborate black hoodie?
What took you guys so long to get here?
And did you find anything?
Why would Aria care if you had a photo of Jason on your phone?
He says his name is Rhys.
I just wanted to be with friends and wanted to go with a friend.
I'm really looking forward to seeing your work.
Thanks for coming.
I should go say hey.
Hey, I thought you weren't comin'.
Yeah, my parents had a change of heart.
Nervous actually.
These photos have been so personal.
I didn't think what it would feel like to show them to a room full of strangers.
I mean, you've done this before.
Does it ever start to feel normal?
This is a first for me.
I just thought in the program, in your bio it says that you won some kind of Governor's Award.
But they, they know how big of a deal this is, right?
And it's-it's not that far of a drive?
And... thank you.
I mean, seriously, I-I never would have done this if it weren't for you.
We are here to celebrate a fresh crop of promising new photographers one of whom will leave here tonight with a $5000 cash prize and a summer internship 'to a premier travel and leisure magazine' 'based in Los Angeles.'
I would like to thank all of the young artists who applied this year.
You gave the judges a real challenge.
And thank you to the Rowitz Fine Arts Gallery for so generously hosting this event.
Now, I'd like to invite you all in to meet our finalists.
He called the pictures Stolen Dolls?
Where is this going to end?
He's talking about when he kidnapped us, right?
Not exactly.
As much as he wanted to ruin Aria's evening and exploit the girls, he also wanted to send me a message.
That he thinks we belong to him?
I grew up in a bilingual household.
I think Charles wants me to know that as much as I uncover about his identity, he can uncover details about mine.
Why did this happen?
He was in this building!
'We will comb through everything' until we find another piece of the puzzle.
When are you gonna find him?
'Charles took pictures of us while we were unconscious.'
You've crossed a line, young lady.
What is this place?
Another real estate investment for the Carissimi Group?
'Or another dollhouse for Charles.'
Bet there's plenty of room inside to lock us up.
There's no way I'm going in there.
I find you very intriguing, Alison.
'This is the last place I'd think to find you' and yet, here you are.
Exactly where you're not supposed to be.
I have questions.
The information in this room is sensitive and you've jeopardized that.
- I didn't touch anything.
- I need you to put that down.
"Superficial charm?"
'After everything I've heard on the news' it almost sounds like a compliment.
And you can recognize his baby rattle?
Pieces were lost.
I still have the hairbrush.
We found it along with a few other personal effects in the bunker.
Why do you think that is?
Maybe he feels bad about trying to hurt me when I was a baby.
He has other things like the home movies my father gave you.
Maybe part of him wants to stay connected to the family.
That's a possibility.
There's another.
I don't think it will please your sense of curiosity about Charles, your brother.
In my experience, murderers can be as sentimental as mothers.
Personal items can help focus them on their victims or commemorate what they've done.
'We'll bring him to justice.'
With lethal force if need be.
You may not want this for your brother but it's necessary for the predator who put six girls through absolute hell.
I'll take Officer Calderon's access card.
I don't think you'll find it useful anymore.
I hope tonight didn't get in the way...
No, Nicole's a photographer as well and she saw your postcard at the Brew.
I saw that she was interested so I suggested that we meet here.
Aria, what happened here was... desperation.
He's obviously so close to being caught.
He wants us back.
We were drugged when Charles took our clothes and posed us... in those pictures.
We'd bundle up.
I don't think I'd ever been as happy to be cold as I was then.
And then I knew it.
I felt it on my bare skin.
That cold metal table.
I'm still cold.
I'm freezing cold all the time.
- 'It's quiet here.'
Someone's coming.
And now he's going inside... to talk to A.
Did you get what you were looking for?
I needed something to make sense of all this.
I don't think the disciplinary committee's gonna see it that way.
You asked me to call in a favor for you?
Was it just to throw me off balance?
How the hell am I supposed to believe you?
I'm working really hard to understand why you did this.
They're gonna kill my brother and I don't really even know him.
I'm one of them, Ali.
Can't really see things turning out much better.
I just wish you would have asked.
You would have said no.
And I would have done the same thing anyway.
Yes, please.
Are you here about the e-mail from the school board?
I don't know how we're gonna tell them.
At the gallery?
The police are not doing enough.
We have to protect our girls.
Ella, what happened?
Can you tell me?
Why didn't you just ring the doorbell?
Guys, what's going on?
Your friend Clark, we're not so sure he's a friend.
What makes you say that?
Are you sure that it was Clark?
None of us saw him leave the gallery and then he just shows up at this place.
This guy Rhys Matthews he works for the Carissimi Group and we think that he might be working for Charles.
"And I am friendly, accessible, ruggedly handsome Richard Castle."
I am joining the pantheon of greats to whose heights I have always aspired.
So which big head?
Uh, I like the ruggedly handsome, smiling giant you.
Oh, Martha, I am so sorry.
Well, there's the "death as opportunity" spirit we all love.
See where I'm heading?
I haven't even gotten my exam results back yet.
What are you guys fighting about?
And I didn't get you anything.
There's still time.
You the folks from the 12th?
Because of the assault, we're classifying the death as a homicide.
Not a house for miles.
We've got our teams out there searching the woods, but we found these tucked into her bra.
$50 bill, key card, and a cash receipt.
From a coffee shop in the city, dated yesterday.
We were hoping you could help us track down who she is and what she was doing here.
Yeah, of course.
Trooper Collins?
The crosses?
We need to talk to that driver.
It was white, with black where the eyes should have been.
Uh, and the... the face, it was, uh... bisected with two black lines, like a cross.
It was real.
The sketch is from the truck driver.
You ready to talk about it?
I was 11 years old.
Their home abutted a few hundred acres of state forest called Hollander's Woods.
We were told never to go into the woods alone.
Somebody told you not to, so you had to do it anyway.
I walked for hours.
I was cold, completely lost.
And that's when I saw him... a figure clad in black, kneeling.
And after a few moments, he left.
Her throat had been slit, and those same symbols were carved into her forehead and her cheeks.
I touched her arm.
I remember thinking how cold it was.
Tell anyone what you've seen here today, and I'll find you and kill you.
Do you understand?
Go!
I waited till I got back to the city to call the police from a pay phone.
So you never figured out who she was?
I checked local papers.
It's like it never happened.
And after a while, I started to wonder if it had.
That day in the woods, Kate... that's why I do what I do.
I'm driven to figure out the story because I could never figure out that one.
Why didn't you ever tell me this before?
I think I didn't want it to be real.
He killed before, and he just tried to kill again.
I checked with the police department near Hollander's Woods.
Okay, what about the F.B.I. database?
There's been no other occurrences in the past 30 years of any assaults or murders with this M.O.
Yeah, a barista there remembered seeing our victim.
After all these years, do you really think it could be the same killer?
So we still don't know who she is.
And look at this.
- License plate numbers.
- Hundreds of them, along with the registered address of each vehicle.
Why would she have that?
Look at the plate numbers.
Each one has the letters "x" and "z" in it.
Our victim was looking for someone specific.
Yeah, but who?
I think I know someone we can ask.
I knew something bad would happen to Emma.
I was trying to find her, to... to stop her.
Mr. Malloy, what was your daughter doing in the city?
Two months ago, a friend of hers disappeared.
Emma was trying to find her.
And what exactly do you mean by "she disappeared"?
Zoey had a boyfriend that was beating on her.
He reported the car stolen, so the cops just figured that Zoey was on the run and ditched it for another ride.
But Emma knew that Zoey wouldn't do that... not without calling.
So Emma took a leave from her cashier's job to try to find her, retracing her route.
Em found a waitress at a truck stop who saw Zoey get in the back of a white Sedan.
Mr. Malloy, do these woods mean anything to you?
Is there any reason that Emma would be in them?
Zoey was coming from Pittsburgh, the opposite direction.
And all this time, no one's heard anything from her?
Zoey didn't have family.
And if it wasn't for Emma, no one would have even known that she'd disappeared.
He targets people who won't be missed... hitchhikers, stranded motorists.
And if not, he's just some good samaritan giving them a ride.
Castle, you were 11 years old.
And what happened to you back then was terrible.
See, Emma must have been able to do what I never could.
Guys, is there any way to check police records from 30 years ago?
And wait for them to stop laughing long enough to beg them to check their dusty storage rooms.
I just got a call from 1PP.
They want me to take you off shift tonight for a performance review.
Um, sir, my review's not scheduled for another three months.
D-do you think that this has something to do with the captain's exam?
No, they don't ask for a meet to discuss exam results.
They notify you by mail.
So w-what's going on?
I don't know, and none of my sources are talking.
But they want you there at 7:30.
Well, maybe it's good news.
I was running those license plates on Emma's list, seeing if any of the owners have criminal backgrounds, when I noticed this car registered to an address right down the street from the coffee shop where Emma went the day she was killed.
Connie Lewis.
But she's 72 and has no criminal record.
What's her address?
There it is.
Exactly as Emma's witness described.
Yeah, but how's a 72-year-old woman connected to all of this?
You okay?
After all these years, I may finally get some answers.
Mrs. Lewis?
NYPD.
It's open.
TV's on.
Mrs. Lewis?
Based on decay, I'd say about three years.
How did no one notice?
Look what I found in the kitchen.
The same matchbook that we found in Emma's hotel room.
If Emma was tailing the killer, she could have followed him there.
I tracked down Lewis' next of kin.
Only family listed is a son.
I'll handle the notification, see what he knows.
Not much, if he hasn't seen her in three years.
It's empty.
Check for the phone.
It's been moved.
You inside, drop your weapon!
Noah Lewis. 52.
He did a stint in the army back in the '90s.
There's no recent record of employment.
He told the neighbors that his mother was bedridden and that he was taking care of her.
So they just assumed that he was the good son.
He says that Noah has borderline personality disorder and exhibited violent tendencies.
Well, we're a little bit more focused on where he is now.
Yeah, from February of '83.
The day after you saw that body, police ticketed an abandoned pickup truck they saw by the roadside near Hollander's Woods.
The truck belonged to a farmer who'd loaned it to a young woman, a migrant worker, to go out and make a supply run.
When the cops told the farmer that they'd found his truck, he assumed that she'd just run off.
What was her name?
Rosalita Campo.
I promise.
That you wanted to be a writer.
I'm finishing my junior year, and I have no idea what I want to do.
By the time you were my age, you'd already published your first book, and now you're winning this amazing award because you followed your passion.
How can I be amazing if I can't find mine?
And whatever you become, there's no question in my mind you are going to be amazing.
'Cause you already are.
They're ready for you, detective.
Take a seat.
So, Detective Beckett, says here you took the captain's exam.
Your job is to enforce the law, yet you have repeatedly ignored it.
- But... you used your badge to pursue a personal vendetta against Senator Bracken, crossing the line and endangering the lives of others numerous times.
Sir, that man was a murderer.
You've withheld case information from superiors and flown in the face of authority whenever it suits you, not to mention your working relationship with Richard Castle.
Tell me, detective, how often have you let your personal feelings for your husband dictate your actions in pursuit of a suspect?
Sir, that is unfair.
I never let... and when he went missing, you used your position and a great deal of the taxpayers' money to search for him, enlisting the aid of fellow detectives.
And, well, you are infamous for being the inspiration for the fictional NYPD detective Nikki Heat, who spends more time on her back than she does pursuing killers.
Detective Beckett, how do you expect to lead or even continue in your current job when it's clear you've exercised such poor judgment?
Thank you.
You can go.
You're wrong, sir.
Excuse me?
I said, "you're wrong."
And regarding my relationship with Mr. Castle, he has proven to be a brilliant partner, and he's always had my back.
You asked, "how do I expect to lead?"
By continuing to fight for what's right, not for what's easy.
My job is to protect the citizens of New York, and I will do it by doing my job better than anyone else and getting results.
And if you have any other questions, then you can ask the families of the victims that I have served.
Sit down.
That was an impassioned and powerful response.
In fact, it was exactly what we were hoping for.
This wasn't a performance review.
Then why would you attack me like that?
We wanted to see if you could defend yourself.
Kate, this was an audition.
We've been looking for someone like you... someone who isn't corruptible, a certifiable hero who the people can get behind.
It's why you went to D.C., why you took the captain's exam.
You want a bigger stage, and we want to give it to you.
We think you have an amazing future.
Doing what?
We'd like you to run for New York State Senate.
State senator?
And they say it's just the start.
Apparently the party has had their eye on me for a while now.
I'm a cop, not a politician.
Did I ever tell you that I was in a model u.N. When I was a kid?
My mom was one of the chaperones.
I just wanted to be her.
I just wanted to make a difference.
And you have.
The question now is, can you make a bigger difference?
You, Alexis, my dad, Martha... you guys would all be fair game.
We're a tough bunch.
So you think I could do it?
I know you can.
They said that I aced my captain's exam.
I could probably have my own precinct within the year.
Thank you.
The unit that we put on that bar spotted Noah Lewis heading inside.
Where's my mother?
Being autopsied.
I warned her, but she wouldn't stop running her mouth at me.
Now she doesn't say a word.
It's what she deserved.
Well, what about the others?
Did they deserve what they got?
Tell us about Emma Malloy.
I'm not good with names.
You know her.
What about this girl?
Zoey Addison.
She was seen getting into your car, Noah.
Is she dead?
I can't help you.
Where do you take them, the others?
How do you make them disappear?
We have your car, Noah, your house.
We will find evidence.
Did Emma find evidence?
Is that why you shot at us?
You were in my house.
I'm the victim.
What's wrong?
We have a problem.
So we can't connect him to either of their murders?
What about his mother's?
Autopsy results indicate that she died of natural causes.
Right now, all we have this guy on is mishandling a body.
In '83, he was at a military academy all the way in south Carolina.
Except those records are gone, so there's no way to prove it.
All the jury's gonna hear is that he was 1,000 miles away from New Hampshire.
Let's coordinate with Collins and set up a canvass up there.
There's got to be a place he goes... somewhere out of the way where he puts the bodies.
If Noah ends up walking, you're gonna have to have me committed.
I will never forget that voice as long as I live.
Please, have a seat.
I wish I could say that I was surprised to hear what Noah had done.
But he was very troubled.
We did everything we could for him while he was in our care.
And what did the two of you talk about?
Anger, intimacy, his animosity toward women.
You went to Dartmouth.
Yes, for undergrad.
He was quite agitated.
He thought someone was following him.
I thought he was just being paranoid, so I adjusted his meds.
He's done this before, you know.
Abducted women, killed them in the woods... possibly for years.
How do you know?
Witnesses.
When he does it, he wears a mask.
What kind of psychosis would drive a man to do that?
Something terrible in his childhood?
The mind of a psychopath is not that simple.
But he kills them anyway.
So why would he need to hide his face behind this?
Maybe he's not hiding it.
Maybe this is his true face...
The monster he knows he really is, and he wants his victims to see it and fear it before they die.
Maybe his real mask is the man he has to pretend to be every day.
Because Dr. Holtzman knew intimate details about his patients, he set Noah up to take the fall just in case anyone got onto the murders.
And Holtzman was in New Hampshire, at Dartmouth, in 1983.
Babe, the voice... is it possible you're misremembering?
You don't believe me.
Look, Castle, we want to solve it as much as you do.
You know what?
I'm sorry.
Except you're right.
There's nothing we can do.
We'd have to sit on him for years, hoping he makes a move.
This is not how the story was supposed to end.
Well, he would have had to have taken them somewhere.
Somewhere his family didn't know about.
There could be a flood, a nosy manager.
He would have to find a place over which he had absolute control.
So I did a property search.
It came up empty on him, but I did find this.
It's possible his wife doesn't know about it.
It's only a few miles from where Emma was hit by that truck.
Tax records show that there's a barn on the property.
He must have held her there.
It's private, in the middle of nowhere.
The perfect lonely place.
Only, I would never get a warrant.
And if I searched it without one, then any evidence I would find would be inadmissible.
It would be trespassing.
And I know how much this means to you, so whatever you decide, I will back your play.
Okay, but you're not going in alone.
So, what are you seeing?
So if someone spotted him, it would lead right back to Noah.
You okay?
Oh, God.
Castle, what do you see now?
I see them.
Photos of his victims.
I see all of them.
How did you find me?
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
You can't win, Holtzman.
We know who you are.
It doesn't matter.
You'll both be dead, and they'll never find me.
It's locked!
I can't get in!
The danger of facing your demons... is that sometimes the demons win.
God!
Still more gruesome discoveries and many more questions at the rural property of noted psychologist Van Holtzman as authorities continue to find the buried bodies of his victims.
Babe, we're not here because of him.
We're here because of who we are in the face of people like him.
We're both trying to bring justice to this world.
Murder, mystery, the macabre... tonight's honoree has mastered them all.
For years, he's kept his readers under his spell with his electrifying prose.
I'm very proud to present this year's recipient of the poe's pen career achievement award, my good friend Richard Castle.
Michael Connelly, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much, Michael.
And my thanks to all of you for this honor.
The long hours, the blank pages.
But we don't do it alone...
Because anything that's good in our writing comes from truth.
And, Alexis, you amaze me every day.
You two are my redheaded pillars of unconditional love.
Especially you two, Javier, Kevin.
You've made me your brother-in-arms, and I thank you for that.
But now I do.
This is because of you.
Because of us.
Always.
That was a lovely speech, darling.
Oh, well, I was inspired.
Castle, who's gonna be your inspiration if Beckett becomes state senator?
Ooh, I would so read that.
Beckett, if you do run, I'll help with your campaign.
Thank you.
That's a pretty big step, Kate.
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Well, I know one thing that will never change... what we all have.
A toast.
To us.
Cheers.
Are you on birth control and stuff?
All right.
"Yes, the pre-ejaculate fluid itself does not contain sperm.
As the pre-ejaculate leaves the body, however, it may pick up sperm from a previous ejaculation that remains in the urethra."
So, like, these other guys are just hanging out, and they just hitch a ride.
I want to get the pill.
All right, um, well, should I call an Uber or something?
Um, is that a good brand or...
It's the best and only brand.
Um, yeah, we'll get one of those, and anything else?
Martinelli's?
And two Martinelli's as well.
My treat.
There we go.
And then the condom broke.
I hope she was on birth control.
Why do they call it Plan B?
I think Plan A is you don't drop a million of your sperm into someone you don't know that well.
Plus, I have a pretty low count.
Really?
You kind of just go to town on the puss?
I mean, there's Saran wrap and dental dam, but don't nobody use that shit.
You don't have, like, a drawer full of dental dams beside your bed?
I got some coconut oil-- rub her down with that.
Ooh, that sounds nice.
Kyle Cooper and his girlfriend were using condoms and birth control.
It just doesn't make sense.
That sounds horrible.
That said, I do know some parents who still eat pasta.
Then you're straight chilling.
You get the nanny to do all the grunt work, you get all the hugs and kisses.
I will say, you know, Kyle used to be just like us, hanging out, drinking and stuff, but he seems happier now that he's settled down, in a way.
No, dude, Kyle's done.
He is having a little birthday party for his kids next weekend.
You guys want to go?
You really thinking about going to a baby party?
Oh, my God, is that one of those pianos you play with your feet?
I'll be right back.
Cool!
I'm just getting some stuff for my baby.
What?
That's crazy.
When did-- When did you guys meet?
About a month after our thing.
Oh, that's cool.
Sounds like a nice white family.
What's the name of that cutie?
What a small world.
Sad story.
Do you have a kid?
No, um, we're going to a friend's baby party, so we're just grabbing a gift.
Yeah, it's crazy to think that that baby has been in the same spot as my little bud's hardware.
Wow, are all those presents for Zach?
Man, my last birthday, all I got was a wine opener from Arnold.
I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
My dude's one, he's already got more friends than you.
I knew it!
Yo, so you do a spot like that, you get a hookup on Go-Gurt, right?
Uh, not really.
Dude, you got to talk to your agent about that.
Yeah, but he changed, man.
All right, y'all have a good one.
See you.
They're still airing that spot?
Damn, that's pretty good.
It's actually making me crave a 'Gurt right now.
Coming through, excuse me!
Oh, it's great.
I feel like I'm part of something bigger now, you know?
I mean, don't you miss going out and all that stuff?
And then we both just start laughing.
I'm laughing with this person I created, right, with my kid, this person I'm gonna watch grow up and do great things one day-- hopefully.
Remember, your education is the key to a prosperous future.
I'm really proud of both of you.
Excuse me, sir!
Can you please get out of the bounce house?
You just bounced out my son Tristan.
With all due respect, ma'am, your son's 20 pounds and he encroached on my bounce space.
Farts!
All right, well, that's cool.
Yeah, he is, but he can still be a real dick sometimes.
Hey, do you want to come by for dinner?
I'm into that, yeah, for sure.
Good arm.
What else has been going on with you, man?
What is it about?
It's an animated kids' movie.
It's, like, bright garbage for an hour and a half.
Oh, hey, why don't I watch them while you go to the meeting and we'll just meet up later at your place?
Are you sure that you can watch them?
Yeah, I'll just take them to the park or something.
Hey, hey, hey, don't yell out people's ethnicities.
Sorry.
- What flavor do you want?
- What do they have?
Ooh, I didn't think about that.
All right, well, can we go at your house?
We're almost there.
Now!
All right, let me see if one of these ladies will go, okay?
Am I not enough of a madam?
Uh, no, I just thought she looked like more of a mom-type person.
Oh, so you think I'm old?
Thanks.
So... what exactly do you need me to do here?
Just keep me company.
Hmm, summer ale.
Uh, yeah, he's my friend's kid.
Everything okay?
I'm gonna need you to pay for the waffles, sir.
He went to the bathroom with me and said not to tell anybody.
Yeah, it's upstairs.
Okay, and Grant, you stay away from the freezer.
Man, I was just watching those guys for, like, an hour, and I'm destroyed.
My secret is, I'm getting a divorce.
What?
Are you serious?
I thought everything was going really well.
What about all that stuff you said earlier?
What am I supposed to say?
Yeah, I guess that's not really good party...
What's the word?
It's tough, man.
And then you throw a kid in the mix...
And Zach's awesome.
It is a great candle.
We found the flour!
You can't hide it from us!
Put your seat belts on!
What are you doing?
Cute kids, idiot.
Anytime I turned around, they were just causing mayhem.
There you go.
They're just, like, running around and screaming and yelling, causing a ruckus.
Are you guys doing anything fun for the summer?
You know what Amanda and James are doing this summer?
Like, they act like they know me, even though, like, thousands of people go in there every day.
I'm there a lot.
Dude, I'm so hungry.
It has peanut butter and lettuce.
You know, the sandwiches look pretty good, but I think I'm gonna have to go with Grant and Lila's instead.
Aw, it's a little racist, but thanks.
It's really good.
Amanda, can I have yours since you're eating their thing?
No, you may not.
I just came back from a meeting with the world's top scientists.
They're all dead.
The virus, it got them all.
I was able to obtain a sample, but it's not in the vial.
It's in my blood.
Amazing pause... one of the best pauses we've heard all day.
Yeah, thank you so much for coming in.
That's another pause.
That was great.
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
There was no "ding, ding" today.
Why don't the dings transfer automatically?
Now Dr. Ramusami probably wandering around Penn Station eating pretzels.
Okay, you don't know that he's eating pretzels.
Also, that's an adorable worst-case scenario for someone lost alone in New York.
Can I just do it later?
What is that?
It's my abacus!
No, it works fine.
No, it's definitely broken.
Dad, I want to study in medical college and become a doctor.
Ramesh, we don't have money for that.
And over here, the examination rooms.
Is that tonight?
Should I get my wife?
A computer!
Can I just do it later?
I got to see this X-Men movie, and I don't want to miss the trailers.
Did you read the Economist article I emailed you?
Uh, no, I didn't get a chance to do that yet.
It exposes how farm subsidies are slowly leading us to a countrywide drought within ten years.
Before you go, can you run and get me a package of rice from the store?
Toku, if you go to America, you won't know anyone.
You won't have anything.
I will have opportunity there.
I will have a better life.
Sorry, we just don't have any tables.
I think they don't want to seat us because we're Asian.
I got to say, out of the 15 X-Men movies that I've seen, that was definitely top nine.
Does your dad always text you to fix stuff?
He averages, like, three words a week.
That's like graduating from community college.
I just feel like Asian parents, they don't have the emotional reach to say they're proud or whatever.
Have you ever hung out with a white person's parents, though?
-They are crazy nice.
Yeah, dude, most white families, they'd be so psyched to adopt me.
Can you go with me so I have an excuse to get out of there quickly?
You want me to hang out with your dad and another old Indian dude?
Uh, no, I'm good, but thank you.
How about some mini popadam?
Sure, I'll take a mini...
I'm actually up for this movie, which is cool.
I've mostly been doing commercials, but recently I decided to try to get into more regular acting.
This was actually my first movie audition.
Well, if the first audition went well, that's very good.
So how did you get into the acting?
This was something you always wanted to do?
Not really.
At your age, your father had barely stopped working at the zipper factory.
Zipper factory?
Yep, I worked in zipper factory for two years to get money to go to medical school.
You never told me about that.
Yes, your father worked very hard.
You know the little tabs that go on the end of the zipper that you pull?
If he didn't come to America, you would probably be working in that same zipper factory now, making the holes.
Instead, Dev lives in America, where his biggest problem is that the Wi-Fi in his apartment is messed up.
Hey, that's a serious issue.
I've seen that video clip!
Very funny!
Brian, can you send me the link, please?
Sure.
Why didn't you just ask me?
I like Brian.
You know stuff about your dad's backstory?
I mean, I know the big points.
Isn't that the gist of every immigrant's story, that it was hard?
Shouldn't you care a little more, being that he's your dad?
Yeah, but, again, he doesn't talk much.
Shouldn't we do something?
Yeah, like a gift or something?
I mean, what would I get my dad for a gift?
I could get him a gallon of water as a gift.
Is there such a thing as a "water of the month" club?
Hey, what if we took them out to a nice dinner and learned more about their lives and just said thank you?
He really liked your read, though, and wanted to know if you could read now via Skype.
Oh, um, well, the Wi-Fi in my apartment is really shoddy.
Hey, can you guys hear me okay?
Yes, we can, Dev.
You're gonna read scene 22, part of Dr. Vincent.
My God.
Dr. Vincent, the pathogen, it's airborne.
The virus, it's eating my flesh!
My eyes are on fire!
What is happening in the lab?
The room, it's contaminated!
The virus is gonna kill us all!
Everyone get the fuck out of here now!
Get out now!
Lock the fucking doors!
And I'm done.
Why the fuck is he in a coffee shop?
Jesus Christ, is he homeless?
Um, the video feed's still live.
All good.
Guys, thank you so much for coming.
Brian and I just wanted to take you to a nice dinner to say thank you.
So, uh... to our parents.
Excuse me, sir.
Can we order the chicken with broccoli, please?
Sorry this man is ordering chicken with broccoli.
What is this super special spicy Szechuan chicken?
Ramesh, why are you looking at that?
You don't even eat spicy food.
Ma, why are you just eating white rice?
I don't even like Chinese food.
I like this place.
Another reason that we wanted to take you guys out was to learn more about you and how you got here.
Dad, do you have any stories you care to share?
I cannot think of anything noteworthy.
I worked very hard.
Well, what about you guys?
What did you do when you were our age here in New York?
I just worked and took care of you and your father.
What about for fun?
You realize fun is a new thing, right?
Fun is a luxury only your generation really has.
That's nonsense.
Do you want a beating?
We don't have time for that.
Hey, man, look.
I got you a guitar.
Dad, I'm playing my game.
We used to take you to soccer team, guitar lesson, Nintendo.
I simply studied, played outside, ate some rice, and went to bed.
Ma, what about your first day in America?
That must have been pretty exciting.
No, I just got dropped off from the airport, and your father went to work.
I didn't know nobody, and I barely knew your father.
No, I sat on the couch and cried.
Well, that's really sad.
You asked!
Well, is there anything else you remember?
Yeah, I was scared to answer the telephone because nobody would understand me because of my accent.
I was scared of answering the phone, too.
Are there any other stories that you remember from when you first got here or from your childhood?
I've been waiting here for 45 minutes.
Where is my chicken with broccoli, man?
Once, when Brian was younger, we were at a restaurant, and they brought a plate of desserts for us to look at.
Brian grabbed a piece of chocolate cake and put it all over his face.
This is fun.
I am having fun.
That was great the other night, man.
My dad used to bathe in a river, and now he drives a car that talks to him.
So crazy to think that every immigrant's story is probably that insane.
I'm just glad we did it.
Like, I can't believe there's a universe where I wouldn't know that my dad had a water buffalo named Ting Ting.
Is my dad on there?
Why am I not on there?
Someone must have screwed up.
They all want to have dinner again tonight.
"Let's chow down at Mr. Chow's."
-Tell them we can't go.
"I'm in!"
I am so sorry about that weird Skype audition.
If there's any way I can read again, I know I can do better.
I agree, which is why I brought you in today for a session with the studio.
Great.
Are you fucking serious?
It's not for people to just take it and go.
This isn't New Orleans.
I just took Dr. Ramusami to the train station.
What's up with you, man?
Nothing much.
Is everything okay?
Me and Mom were watching your Go-Gurt commercial.
You did a good job, man.
Did you show the YouTube to them?
Well, it's okay.
You will get into the next one.
All right, talk to you later.
All right, open them.
-Very nice.
Thank you, Dev.
You get a hug for that.
Yup, I got you something, too.
Photo.
I love you.
I love you, too.
All right, where should we go eat?
Mr. Chow's.
Ramesh, get out of here.
You know I don't like Chinese food.
You want to just cook some food at home?
Yeah, let me make some korma.
All right, here, give me the iPad.
You're right, Dad.
I told you.
My fingers hurt when I held the strings.
Let me play my computer games, man.
This must be it.
Well, you've sort of got antlers.
- Antlers?
- Yes, antlers.
You are a time-space machine!
You're a vehicle!
I've never asked you to cheer me up with hologrammatic antlers!
Thank you.
- Close enough, why?
- Well, you know.
Will there be singing?
It's been a long day.
Are you expecting a surgeon?
So what's the medical emergency?
Didn't you read the agreement?
There it is.
- What?
- There, that's it.
That's what?
Oh, the flying saucer.
Is that new?
Come on.
Well, you took your time.
That's an ongoing problem for me.
- I've had a haircut, this is my best suit.
- Do I know you?
- You most certainly do not.
And now that you've met me, you'll do your very best to forget me.
Sometimes Professor, but mainly Doctor.
- How do you know me?
- Well, it's a tiny bit complicated.
- Any questions?
- What seems to be the problem?
My husband is dying.
Something wrong?
I think I'm going to need a bigger flowchart.
Husband, I return to you.
Where is my queen?
- That's your husband?
- Listen, you are being watched by four billion people.
You are surrounded by warrior monks with sentient laser swords, genetically engineered anger problems and not enough to do.
Best just stay still and keep your hands by your side.
No, wait...
- THAT's your husband?
Yes, that's who you're married to, not anybody else?
My love, attend me, woman!
I fly to you.
Is there a problem?
- Right, so you don't recognise me, then?
- Why would I recognise you?
Oh, no reason.
Don't cross your arms.
He's a lying-down person.
The only husband I will ever have.
My time with you has been too short.
- Because they cross, I've got cross arms.
- My love?
- If you die this day, this galaxy will drown in tears.
Look at them -- your people!
They watch and hope and pray.
This might be an alarming question in the circumstance, but... you really do think I'm a surgeon, don't you?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't do that.
- You what?
- It's my back.
It simply refuses to carry the weight of an entirely pointless stratum of society who contribute nothing of worth to the world and crush the hopes and dreams of working people.
Can you save me, Surgeon?
Well, that depends upon what's wrong with you.
- There's something in his brain.
- You could have fooled me.
Oh, sorry.
- Yeah, I would say it is.
- My love, you must rest.
The surgeon and I will discuss the procedure.
Prepare, master of my life, to live anew.
Patience be with you all.
Our King will rise again!
Why?
I'm the Doctor.
You'd better be, you've got an operation to perform.
Here's the entry wound, just below the hairline.
And... .. there's the projectile.
It should have killed him straight off, but he's very strong.
- That's not a bullet.
- It's a diamond.
- How did it get in there?
- No!
In the ensuing firefight, the whole thing blew up in his face, with the result that he now has the most valuable diamond in the universe lodged three inches inside his enormous head.
So... .. can you remove it?
It's very small, it might be difficult to manoeuvre it.
- Wouldn't that kill him?
- You're the medical expert, but I'd say so, yes.
- Your husband?
- Slash murderer slash thief.
An archaeologist IS just a thief.
It'll fit in here, don't you think?
I've checked it for leaks.
- Is this what you're like when I'm not...?
Cheer up, get a saw, I'll kill the lights, you kill the patient.
I employed you!
You agreed to this.
Do you not know who that man is?
King Hydroflax, the butcher of the Bone Meadows, who ends his battles by eating his enemies, dead or alive.
The murder of a creature like that wouldn't weigh heavily on my conscience, even if I had one.
What's that face?
Are you... thinking?
- Stop it, you're a man, it looks weird.
- I need more information.
- For what?
- For my diagnosis.
I'll be the judge of that.
I'm the Doctor.
You know who you remind me of?
Yes, probably a chap with a big...
My second wife.
Darling!
You're up and about!
- False wife!
- How much better you're looking!
You plan to take my head.
Perhaps you should have just asked.
You married a cyborg and you didn't even know it.
I'll have you flogged and flayed and burnt.
I will crush every last remnant of you from this universe.
How dare you!
I'm your wife.
- You planned to murder me!
- Don't change the subject.
Why are you doing this?
You have an ancient artefact of great value to good people, and whatever it takes, I'm going to bring it home to them.
You have stolen so much from so many, King Hydroflax, and I'm the woman who's going to steal it all back.
If you know what's good for you, do not lay a finger on that woman.
- Put me down.
Get yourself under control.
Do not attack the female.
Nobody move, or the head gets it!
Sonic trowel, you realise how ridiculous that sounds?
Look at that, your body's got a mind of its own.
More like an onboard computer for the cybernetic component.
- It's not sexy.
- Absolutely sexy.
- Why is everything sexy now?
- Do not put me in the bag.
I will not be placed into a bag!
Stop shouting a minute if you want to go face-up.
- You will beg my infinite mercy!
When I escape, I will bring terror to you and your family.
There is no escape from the...
Is something funny?
Who dares laugh at Hydroflax?
You shall be crushed!
You shall scream in fear!
- Let me out of this bag!
- This is a serious mission in a critical phase.
There is nothing to laugh about here.
We're being threatened by a bag!
By a head in a bag!
I can't approve of any of this, but I haven't laughed in a long time.
Unzip this bag!
- You know, don't you?
- Who are you?
- You know who I am, it's... it's... it's me.
Professor Song!
As an activity, it's not hugely varied, is it?
I'm so sorry.
This is my husband, Ramone.
Another one?
- Are you going to kill him, too?
- We're not actually married.
Found the capsule just over in the village, but I can't locate Damsel.
None of these men are here.
- Codename -- "Damsel in Distress".
Apparently, he needs a lot of rescuing.
What if he has a face that you don't know about yet?
He has limits.
Well, then, let's go find him.
- I didn't really know anything.
- You have information.
Anything you like.
- I'll even write it down for you.
- That will not be necessary.
- Your cooperation is appreciated.
Pursuit now commences.
This is too tall!
I'm afraid of heights.
We can't hang around waiting, he could be ages.
Hush, you wouldn't understand.
You can't.
It's a... time... machine.
I can take it, do whatever I want for as long as I like and pop it back a second later, he'll never know it was gone.
- Yes, he will.
Maybe... he'll notice now.
I'll see you on Temple Beach.
I've already picked out your swimwear.
- OK, but be careful.
- Absolutely not.
Please, look after her for me.
Oh, before you come in, you'd better prepare yourself for a shock.
It's not as... snug as it looks.
Finally.
It's my go.
I know where you're going with this, but I need you to calm down.
- On the outside!
- You've certainly grasped the essentials.
My entire understanding of physical space has been transformed!
Three-dimensional Euclidean geometry has been torn up, thrown in the air and snogged to death!
Sorry.
I've always wanted to see that done properly.
What's that noise?
It seems to have powered down, conserving batteries.
- I really don't care.
- What's that noise?
- So the rest of him is coming?
- He must be very cross -- he's lost his head.
- You're doing it wrong.
- I am certainly not.
Not those levers.
- Does it?
- What is wrong with you?
Better avoid deck seven then.
Something's interfering with the engines, which is technically not possible.
Maybe the engines are interfering with themselves.
Head and body.
Which would mean -- and again, I'm just wildly theorising here -- that's the door would not engage properly.
- I mean, that just wouldn't be good manners, would it?
Seriously?
Hello, is that you?
- Nardole, is that you?
- It's me, yes.
- Please, you've got to help me.
- What's wrong?
Where are you?
Come a bit closer.
- What are you doing there?
Are you injured?
- Nardole, why are you pointing a gun at your own head?
Just do as it says.
It's signalling.
Well, we could chop his head off.
- Oh, look...
- Does sarcasm help?
- Wouldn't it be a great universe if it did?
Kill me, and my body will burn.
- Burn what?
- This world!
Inquiry -- are you acquainted with the criminal River Song?
That wasn't me, that was him!
Repeat, are you acquainted with the criminal River Song?
Please, just answer it.
Yes.
You will take River Song a message.
What message?
Suppose we believe you -- how?
My body contains a split quantum actualiser.
A perpetually stabilised black hole -- that's your power source.
What sort of medical school did you go to?
- A really good one for doctors.
- So you could wipe out this solar system.
A king does not endanger his people for no reason.
- You're endangering them now.
- I'm cross.
Kill her now!
Death initiating.
I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry!
- Where are we going?
- Get the hell out!
- Stop them!
- Death initiating.
- You set the coordinates -- where for?
- Just get the damn head!
- Kill them!
I'm not a hushing person.
'We are currently cruising at warp factor 12.'
'Traversing the fourth galaxy of our seven-galaxy cruise.'
'Next is the Andromeda galaxy.'
'Supernova approaching now to starboard.'
Flemming!
How are the twins?
Still digesting their mother, thank you for asking.
- I'm sure it was a lovely ceremony.
- Oh, there were tears.
And just a hint of screaming.
Er, Flemming, I wonder, could you deadlock seal the baggage hold for me?
Do you remember that time I was transporting dragon eggs?
Consider it done.
- I'll have the chef prepare him immediately.
- No, you won't.
He will in fact be joining me to eat.
I was about to suggest that force-feeding might be required.
Oh, no, that's fine, Thanks.
I have an irritable bowel.
My revenge will be merciless!
- I will rip you open and devour you!
- It's having a day.
You cannot escape!
- This way.
- Your actions will not go unpunished!
- So, what's the occasion?
- I've got the diamond, now it's time to sell it.
I thought you were returning it to the Halassi?
Tell me, were you born boring, or did you have to work at it?
Where did you find a buyer?
Look around you.
The starship Harmony And Redemption, minimum ticket price one billion credits, plus the provable murder of multiple innocent life forms.
Even the staff are required to have a verifiable history of indiscriminate slaughter.
This is where genocide comes to kick back and relax.
Do try the fish.
Mr Flemming, there's an issue.
Why are you frowning?
How did you know?
It's audible.
Deadlock seals can be broken.
By geniuses.
Hydroflax has a brain the size of a pea and it's currently under the table.
- I posed as his nurse.
It's the easiest lie you can tell a man.
They'll automatically believe any story they're the hero of.
River, there's, er... there's something I should probably tell you.
Dr Song, your guest has docked, he should be with you in a very few minutes.
- Of course.
What's the book?
Oh, it's my diary.
The man who gave me this was the sort of man who'd know exactly how long a diary you were going to need.
He sounds awful.
Not somebody special then?
But terribly useful every now and then.
He's in the main hold, sir, but you've deadlocked it.
If you don't mind be observing, sir, you do seem a little nervous.
Is someone threatening you?
I'm the only one here.
- Confirmed, sir, there's only one reading in the hold.
- Don't worry, I'll just stick my head round the door.
- So who is this buyer?
- No idea, he just responded to the advert.
- Which of you is Song?
- Who wants to know?
I am Scratch.
I represent the Shoal of the Winter Harmony.
Show me the money.
Just a thought, you probably shouldn't do that in a restaurant.
The diamond.
You're going to have to dig for it a bit, but somehow I don't think that's going to be a problem for you.
This is a public place, there won't be any tricks.
This is not a public place.
- Block booking, that's clever.
- You needn't have bothered.
I've brought what you want.
Please do assume that I have also taken precautions, and don't do anything that might make me cross and kill you.
Statement accepted.
The diamond is here?
The payment, then.
Here you go, then.
You may need to use a spoon or knitting needle or something.
- Be it known, we do not do this for ourselves.
- I really don't care.
We do it in honour of our distant and loving King, who once visited our world in blood and joy.
Hydroflax.
Er... well, er... awkward.
- I beg of you, not my head!
- Information is required.
You know of River Song, wife of Hydroflax?
- You need a head.
We have paid, we will receive.
Yes, you will.
Of... by jingo, you will, yes, of course.
Yes, you will receive, and here it is.
Now, on its way.
- This small distance.
- We will receive!
Here you go.
And you can have the bag as well.
You will remain.
Is that strictly necessary?
I do not like... surprises.
Well, it's going to be a funny old day.
Death has been done this day!
Noble blood has been spilled.
And our tears will surely follow.
The sky shall crack, the ground shall heave, and even the rocks and the stones shall weep their rage.
Rest now, sweet prince.
Walk amongst us nevermore.
Shall we start the bidding at 200 billion?
I'm sorry, Professor Song, but we really couldn't keep this treasure from the truly devout.
My apologies to the truly devout.
It doesn't say much for your king if you can't put a price on his head.
Professor Song!
Has the food disappointed you?
At last, I am whole again.
Come to me, my body.
Scan in progress.
You don't need to scan me, just put me back.
Tissue deterioration now irreversible.
What are you going to do about that?
Additional, the projectile inside your brain continues to move.
Prognosis -- death in seven minutes.
Well, I refuse.
King Hydroflax does not accept death.
Orders requested.
I don't suppose you could fetch that over for me, could you?
The ultimate guide to the Time Lord known as the Doctor.
Don't you dare touch that!
Long live the King.
And goodness me, a picnic at Asgard.
Some people really know how to snack, don't they?
You should know, I have a significant history of escaping.
"The Crash of the Byzantium." Didn't they make a movie of that?
And when I do, I'm going to kill you.
Oh, Jim the Fish!
Well, we all know Jim the Fish.
And the longer you spend reading my diary, the longer I'm going to take.
And you've just been to Manhattan.
What planet is that?
So do, please, keep going.
This is irrelevant.
If I may intrude, Your Majesty.
The Doctor is a legendary being of remarkable power and an infinite number of faces.
His head, I assure you, would be your crowning achievement.
Besides which, many of us on this ship would be happy to see his career cut off, as it were, at the neck.
Proceed faster, or YOUR head will be taken!
I would give my head with gladness.
This woman is the known consort of the Doctor.
So, where is the Doctor now?
I haven't the faintest idea.
- You're the woman he loves.
- No, I'm not.
- My information is correct.
You are the woman who loves the Doctor.
He's the Doctor, he doesn't go around falling in love with people.
And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with.
Your Majesty, I assure you, she is the perfect bait.
When this woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come.
- Possibly on this ship.
God knows where he is right now, but I promise you, he's doing whatever the hell he wants and not giving a damn about me!
You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.
And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!
Hello, sweetie.
- I'll have to check with the stars themselves.
Shut up!
I was just keeping them talking till it kicks off.
Four exits, two concealed, one in the ceiling.
- Too close to the engine ducts?
- A bit too tight.
I hope you're not being personal.
Excuse me, what are you talking about?
- Cease this conversation.
Darling, in the event of a sudden meteor strike on the lower starboard decks, where would you say is the safest place to stand?
- Meteor strikes?
- Exactly here, I should think.
- It's cheaper than a taxi.
- That meteor strike.
- How could you know?
I'm an archaeologist from the future.
I dug you up.
See you in 400 years.
- What do you think, by the way?
How have you got a new one, by the way?
Aren't there rules?
- A thing happened.
- I bet it probably did.
The diamond?
- Good, aren't I?
- Oh, don't stop for strangers.
- Look who's talking.
King Hydroflax will live again.
This connects every bank to every other bank in this galaxy.
Demonstrate.
With pleasure.
Welcome to all the best firewalls in the galaxy.
Nothing is protected like money.
Sorry, I appreciate that wasn't very funny, but I couldn't help saying it.
'Surface impact in two minutes.'
- We need to get the nav com back online.
- And re-route the thrusters.
- Cleopatra!
- Same thing.
Hang on a minute.
That's Darillium!
- You know... the Singing Towers.
Yes, I'll be sure to give them a wave as we zoom past.
You always say you're going to take me there for dinner and then you always cancel at the last minute.
What are you doing?
Hold this, quickly.
Well, I don't see what good this will do.
Sorry, River.
No, you don't!
You can do it, you can do it.
No, River, no, no, no, no!
- I've been doing it longer.
- I do it better.
- Darling, shall we pop back indoors?
- Yeah, good idea.
'.. four, three, two, one.'
Indestructible as ever.
- Yes, I did.
I've been searching for survivors.
Thank you, sir.
Those are the Singing Towers, aren't they?
Yes, sir, but it's just the wind.
The Singing Towers of Darillium.
I think you'll find that the reward is pretty substantial.
- I'm sorry, sir, the first available slot I have is Christmas Day in four years' time.
Not a problem.
- Professor Song!
- Excellent.
- This way, ma'am.
- What are you doing here?
Don't worry.
The nasty part's all gone -- got deleted in the merger.
- Merry Christmas, Nardole!
Oh, thank you.
You look, er, amazing.
Doctor, you have no idea whether I look amazing or not.
- So what do you think?
The Singing Towers.
Are you crying?
No.
Just the wind.
It blows through the cave system and harmonises with the crystal layer.
I told you, my diary's nearly full.
I worry.
Please don't.
- I look them up sometimes.
- You really shouldn't do that.
Some of them suggest that... .. the very last night we spend together is at the Singing Towers of Darillium.
That wouldn't be true, would it?
Spoilers.
Not forever.
But you're you.
No, I don't, not always.
Times end, River, because they have to.
Because there's no such thing as happy ever after.
It's just a lie we tell ourselves because the truth is so hard.
No, Doctor... .. you're wrong.
Happy ever after doesn't mean forever.
It just means time... .. a little time.
But then... you can't expect a monolith to love you back.
No, you can't.
They've been there for millions of years, through storms and floods and wars and... time.
Nobody really understands where the music comes from.
It's probably something to do with the precise positions, the distance between both towers.
Even the locals aren't sure.
So... .. assuming tonight is all we have left...
24 years.
My name is Alex Parrish.
Protecting our country had always been my dream, but my life took a drastic turn.
It all started nine months ago, on my way to the FBI academy.
You think one of these people is a terrorist?
We're pretty sure they already were a terrorist when they got to Quantico.
There's a terrorist out there, and no one's even looking for them.
I can help, but I have to make it look like I think you're guilty.
I need to find the truth.
Break free of your ties and get out of the pool.
I think if we lock our elbows, we could use the leverage to break the straps.
I thought we were supposed to do this together.
You'll feel better if you figure it out yourself.
Eyes on the road, Georgia Peach.
A hero's welcome.
Yes, I do.
Right answer.
The executive assistant director's ready for you.
I want to know where Alex Parrish is.
It's good to see you.
You too.
But you have to admit, you were dragging a little today.
Maybe you're tired from all those late-night phone calls you take in the bathroom.
Someone missing you back home?
And, apparently, neither does Alex if she's awake before the London opening bell.
I hate that I barely finished in time... no thanks to her.
Don't blame yourself.
Vasquez just plays to win.
So do I.
I'm just getting tired of losing.
Admit it... you miss it.
Looks like you have a fan.
Guess he's been away from the courtroom so long, he's decided to put me on trial.
I have a boyfriend.
What is it?
Are you sure you want to read it?
That's why I'm here, Liam... to find out what kind of man he really was.
Lance Corporal Ryan Booth.
Served four years in the marine corps, including two tours of duty in Iraq.
Recipient of the bronze star.
Ms. Shelby Wyatt.
These are the faces you present to the world... the story you tell about yourself.
But underneath that narrative lies the psychology that drives you.
It allows you to know the criminal.
Before you know the enemy, you have to know yourself.
When you applied to the FBI, we constructed psychological profiles of you... breakdowns of your mental strengths and emotional weaknesses.
Get real, get deep, don't hold anything back.
I'd better be impressed.
Yeah, I've heard of it "American Psycho."
It's usually the smartest people who have the biggest blind spot.
Alex Parrish.
Second-generation special agent, first in her class, or should I say first in your class, O'Connor?
You must be so proud.
Sir... no, I talk.
Because I have to tell the press something... anything.
We have Miranda in custody for helping her escape.
All you're giving me is how.
What I need is a why.
There's a big country we need to take it by the hand, tell it a story.
We wait too long, somebody else will, then we'll never get control of this thing.
You want to know why Parrish bombed Grand Central?
Ask the woman who raised her.
But I already said I don't know anything.
I... why won't anyone listen?
I'll make sure of it.
Good, because you and I go on-camera in an hour.
Looks like you got the message.
You give me one good reason why I should help you.
Because if we don't find out who really bombed Grand Central, who knows what they'll do next?
And he was right.
You think I did it, Simon?
The Alex Parrish I knew at Quantico wasn't a terrorist.
I'm still the same person.
Are you?
Yeah, well, maybe Agent Asher could have helped you, but Simon Asher only works for a startup.
Whoever framed me staged my apartment to look like I built a bomb, but they left that behind.
I'll never forget how you handled that bomb at Quantico.
Ultimately, it didn't matter, did it?
Everybody got to see the real me... and didn't really like what they saw, did they?
I did.
Besides, looks like you landed on your feet all right.
Look, Simon, these are the only bread crumbs I have to find out who the real terrorist is.
And you're the only one who can help me.
My firm, uh, does have government contracts that allow me access to secure databases.
Tell me what you see, Alex.
How would you say you feel about your mother?
Not as good as I feel about yours.
I would have checked the map first.
Show you mine if you show me yours.
Hey, let me ask you a question...
And those are just the ones we've found.
Natalie... clear the room.
Hello, Sita.
Can't even look an old friend in the face?
My history with Michael is a matter of record and totally irrelevant right now.
I barely know her anymore.
Okay, look, I know you want to protect her, but it's in Alex's best interest that you let go.
I asked you to dig deep.
And you delivered.
Beyond expectations.
Perhaps the most searing insights into one another that I have seen in my time here.
I'm very proud.
You can see the results of your profiles posted outside.
Enjoy your evening.
They took our profiles and boiled them down to the greatest hits.
Knowing the truth about yourself, no matter how painful, is what your training here is all about.
Your lives will depend on it.
So you can use it.
Each of you will submit three names of trainees who you think should be cut from the program... who's too weak to carry a badge, who you wouldn't trust with your life.
You have two hours.
What if we don't play along?
Then I'll cut 10 myself.
3 or 10... it's your call.
What do you do here?
Now, I think I can isolate the country of manufacture based on the chemical taggant, but we should also run your fingerprints.
Oh, they told me my fingerprints were all over it.
That's confirmation bias.
They weren't looking for anyone else's.
Sometimes, people make the simplest mistakes when under pressure.
- Your what?
- My scar.
You remember that sink-or-swim exercise we did at Quantico?
I cut myself breaking out of those zip ties, but these fingerprints... don't show it.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Which means whoever's framing me... they didn't start last week or last month.
They started to frame you the day you walked into Quantico.
You found something?
Did I ever.
But this wire... this wire is the rara avis.
It is a total black swan.
Wait... are you telling me the entire bomb was made with government resources?
Okay, we can find that out with time, but this wire is the key.
This is the only piece of evidence that's real.
Hey, sweetheart, maybe if you made a couple friends, they'd call you, too.
Hey, sorry, bro... just following orders in my willfully ignorant and potentially lethal way.
When did you get so good at this?
This is not how we do things around here.
There's no place here for the weak.
I told you I was gonna turn up the heat, and I did.
Sita, look at the evidence.
Her apartment, where she planned and built the bomb.
Her request to work perimeter detail at the DNC in New York, giving her access to Grand Central.
Her go bag... everything she needed to make her escape.
How long was Alex in the FBI Academy before she finally admitted to you she wasn't in grad school?
You believed that lie.
What else are you holding on to?
Like the fact that her father was an agent.
Just like you did when you took the blame for his death.
Sita, we both know she pulled the trigger that night.
You took the blame, but she carried the guilt.
Sita, don't let what you wish were true keep you from admitting what you know is true.
I wasn't only protecting Alex that night.
I was protecting you.
Get your hands off me.
Yeah, and some things we kind of did.
Why don't you ask Timothy McVeigh?
I don't know why you're mad.
Everyone was criticized.
Everyone wasn't.
But you said they wrote we were average and aggressive.
I did, but... then why are you mad?
They're foolish.
I'm not mad at them, Nimah.
Your aggression, your bad performance that I have to match.
They are going to vote us out.
I hope they do.
What... since we're being honest here, what is it that makes me creepy?
You sure you want to do that?
You want to call your imaginary friends at the marine base to help you out?
Enough!
Which is exactly why we shouldn't.
10 from her is better than 3 from us.
Where's Simon?
Come in.
May I help you?
There's been a turn upstairs.
We decided not to cooperate with your exercise.
That's unfortunate.
I'll have to cut 10.
No, you won't.
Life's full of hard choices.
This wasn't one of them.
Looking out for yourself?
No.
It's for the greater good.
Found anything yet?
Still looking.
It's been almost an hour, Simon.
Maybe if you stopped hovering.
Security I.D.'d her off the CCTV and passed it up the chain.
We have the footage?
I know how this looks.
I'm guessing so do they.
Look, I can't get away with helping you unless I can prove that it was under duress.
I needed to do everything in my power to make it look like I alerted the authorities.
You better be.
Move.
For now.
One defection, and it won't even matter.
You take care of everyone else.
You ever let anyone take care of you?
It's nothing I want to talk about.
I just went for a walk.
After curfew?
And so should everybody else.
Why would you do that?
Because every single person here worked so hard to get in.
Now, if it's a choice between losing 3 of you or 10 of you, that's no choice at all.
I thought I knew you.
Nobody knows anybody else.
Ever.
You guys, we can't do this.
Everybody should go to Miranda's office and vote.
Some of us, anyway.
Maybe you'll get lucky, and you won't have to carry me on your back anymore.
I might as well put down our name myself.
I want more, and you should, too, especially since you're so good.
I can learn to run faster or fight better, but you can never learn to be your own person.
All right.
As hard as it is for you here, you still want to stay?
Are you going to vote?
I may not like what anyone said about me, but I like myself.
Where are you headed?
To vote.
That won't be necessary.
You know, I have to say... we've run this exercise on every class of NATs, and it always turns out a little different, but no class has decided actually to vote.
Did any of you think that the whole point of this was to test your character?
For turning on your people when they needed you the most.
I need to go to the bathroom.
Yes... now.
You know exactly where to go and how to get there, right?
I want to make sure you're safe.
Safe in FBI custody, maybe.
Look, local police will get here first, all right?
There's no access to the main street on this side of the building, so you'll have a head start, but only if you go right now.
All this time, and I still don't know who the real Simon Asher is.
Nobody's ever just one thing.
Now, look... when they get here, they're gonna have a lot of questions, and I'm gonna have to be able to answer them, but only if you make it look good for the cameras.
I know the playbook they're running on you.
I taught it for years.
You can resist it.
Why are you blocking the door?
I know you.
You're that agent whose son...
Mrs. Parrish, your daughter has the weight of the FBI pushing down on her.
If she loses you, what will she have left?
We good?
I'd apologize, but...
Deep down, you kind of meant it?
Maybe I am creepy.
And maybe you're a drone.
Just 'cause you follow orders doesn't make you a drone.
You have no idea what it's like over there, what it does to you.
It's because I saw what people are really capable of.
Good policy... on both counts.
You weren't wrong about my weaknesses, either, Shelby.
Like that file in your bag.
My father was an FBI agent.
I always wanted to know so much about him, but now that I have it, I...
You're afraid you might find out something you don't want to know.
Well, you might not know this, but my dad died on 9/11.
You see, my dad always wanted me to be his little country girl, and I was.
And my mom wanted me to be her little pageant queen, and, boy, was I ever.
Take all the time you need.
I want you to watch something.
More propaganda?
No, not propaganda, and not some misguided ambush in the bathroom.
Just the truth.
And she stayed there for 10 years.
But we only knew where she was for nine of them.
She lied.
In order to make our agents stronger, we have to break them down to build them back up again.
It's the only way.
Thank you for keeping up appearances.
Well, they're closer to each other.
You should get some rest.
I have an appointment.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
You know what?
You make me sad.
'Cause I'm so much better than you?
When we finish here, I have people to go home to.
I have a family.
Someone's looking a bit woozy.
The only thing in my profile from you was nice.
You could have said so many mean things.
Thank you.
Guess you needed some air, too, huh?
You still don't feel like talking?
My father was a special agent.
I-I had no idea.
Neither did I for most of my life.
I-I just knew him as two men... the father that I loved, who made me feel safe, and the bitter drunk that scared me so much that one night... all my life, I told myself that.
What are you talking about?
He was a hero, Ryan!
He saved hundreds of lives.
The daughter I knew was a good person.
And the truth about her past should no longer be hidden.
For too long, I ignored the red flags.
You look better.
Are you eating again?
You put me here.
Clearly, this isn't working.
No, they think it is.
Which is why I'm gonna get paroled.
I'll see you soon, ma.
Maybe she felt trapped.
Please put her on.
I told you if you went away for five months, you'd never see her again.
Or maybe she felt she was completely alone in the world.
Turn yourself in while you still can... while you're still alive.
How was the debrief?
A couple of field agents questioned me.
We have work to do.
So, you're setting up all the NATs and analysts that were in our class?
I think you're in the clear.
Uh, uh, look, I'll... be right back, okay?
Thank you, Agent Asher.
Slow and steady on this one.
My memory of Lucien goes back to a time when our family was happy.
Things were good, or as good as they can be for vampires hiding in plain sight.
In hindsight, I could've done more to prevent what was to follow, but then, even an endless life cannot be played in reverse.
It's impressive work, milord.
It's a trifle meant to pass a dull day, but I'll take it along with the word of a friend.
For the lady Aurora.
But your family staying here cannot last much longer, anyhow, not given your brother Kol's decadence.
The local religious believe they are beset by demons.
Soon, you'll need to run.
Aurora and I can run with you, aid you in your endeavors.
Niklaus, please.
I thought the matter settled.
How could I tell him that Aurora was already in love with another?
No.
If anyone finds you here...
My handmaids must have seen him enter.
Do you think he cares?
Do you not know what manner of man you are with?
Go now, please, please, by the window, same as you came.
Niklaus, go, please.
You.
Take him.
Brother, please.
Now, before we murder Lucien, there are certain questions that need to be answered, chiefly, what is he doing here?
I'm afraid we might have to resort to something deliciously medieval here, brother.
"We."
I take it you will lower yourself to associate with your bastard brother, then.
Have you finally forgiven me?
Every one of the victims has the same profile...
Grew up rich, family comes from old money, successful, educated, white males living a playboy lifestyle.
So it is one guy, not a copycat.
I should head down there.
They might need the type of help a gun can't provide.
You're just sensitive to it, ok?
We spent 6 months as wolves in the bayou.
I wanted to be with her so badly, and now I am, and I just feel off.
Calling Freya to baby-sit.
Long as this serial killer's in the news, cops are gonna be all over this city like a rash, so for now, no feeding on tourists, and don't even think about going near the locals.
So what, then, puppies and bunnies?
Josh, you can talk to our contacts at the blood banks and hospitals.
Let them know you'll be coming by.
For the rest of you, keep everyone else in line.
All we got to do is ride it out.
Klaus and Elijah will get it sorted out, and we'll be back to business in no time.
Somehow I doubt that.
Your current dilemma will get worse before it gets better.
The good news is, I can help.
I don't know who you are, but you definitely walked into the wrong place.
I'm afraid you missed him.
Where is he?
At the police station.
A detective Kinney had some questions for him.
And he allowed himself to be arrested?
He has nothing to hide.
Lucien's occupied.
Mr. Castle, thought you might want to see this.
Oh, they were, in life, anything but poor...
Solid gold cufflinks, Bulgari watches.
But for a twist of fate, one of those faces might be mine.
Well, you sound real frightened by the prospect.
You know, in my experience people like you don't believe in fate.
They make their own luck, whether it's good or bad.
Well, then I shouldn't be here long.
People like me tend to have exceptional lawyers to get us out of trouble like this, but while I'm here, you should know that I do hate to be bored, and you bore me.
Well, you said yourself, you're part vampire.
Figured it'd be a good place for you to blow off some steam.
You might feel better if you hit something, even if it's me.
You got muscle and a bad temper, but I'm pretty good with one of these things, might make us even, at least enough to get a workout in.
I thought New Orleans had the same burden of proof as the rest of the colonies.
The murders started the same day you got into town.
That's not to say I had anything to do with this, far from it.
Why bother denying it if you are what you say you are?
I fear I'm being a touch lenient, given his intentions for my sister.
Why torture a loyal servant?
I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding.
One that remains outside your concern.
As son of the count, I may discipline staff as I see fit.
I myself interviewed one such maiden, quite pretty, thus far, the only survivor of these attacks.
I asked what manner of creature had hunted her.
She said she was certain it was the lord Kol but with the face of a beast.
Your entire family sought refuge here claiming to be noblemen when, in fact, you are fiends.
I can only surmise that you are hiding, which means you're afraid.
Do so at your peril, but should any misfortune befall me, know that I have instructed my fastest riders to spread word of your presence here.
Whomever seeks you would most certainly hear the news.
Niklaus, release him.
Please.
You're choosing victims who are the contemporary equivalent of the privileged son who hurt you.
I share a deeply personal tale of woe, one meant to garnish sympathy and inspire kinship, yet all you take away is an admission of guilt.
Messed-up new guy comes to town, messed-up new guy is responsible for murders.
Now, if someone wants to weaken my ability to protect Niklaus, perhaps it's because they themselves would like to see him dead.
I have to say, I'm impressed.
Given that I'm 3 times your age, you held your own quite well.
Elijah and I can begin now, but just us.
Sadly, I've already shown you what visions of yours I've managed to divine.
I'd like to see his, please.
Since family is one of your concerns and you two are brothers, are you so sure you want to see what I have to show you?
Oh, I never could resist a good spoiler.
Well, at least your visions were specific.
It seems Lucien has intentions for Camille.
And where are you going?
I'm going to eliminate an old friend before he gets his teeth into my therapist.
If she blows out that candle, we're back to being wolves, and what if I'm holding hope?
You ain't gonna hurt her.
I'm not going anywhere.
What woman?
We tried to get rid of her, and, boom, smackdown city, which, obviously, went quite well.
Did this woman happen to have a name?
So you know her.
We both know that nothing you say proves anything, so what I want to know is why you asked to speak to me.
Why tell me your story?
Is it because I know Klaus and part of you must still blame him?
The truth is, I know you have Klaus' ear, and I need him to trust me.
I am like you?
Talk about trauma, not the wounds themselves or even the execution, but the humiliation of being judged by one's supposed betters.
In fact, I can prove it.
Prove it how?
Well, if by nothing else, then, perhaps, logic.
Why should I undermine my own safety by leaving behind a trail of dead bodies?
I mean, why commit myself to these preposterous murders?
Now, isn't that the question we should be asking, and how fortunate it's one I can answer?
Klaus, he says he knows who the killer is.
For the same reason you lied about avoiding a werewolf bite when Elijah saw it with his own eyes.
This ends now.
Then you're giving Tristan the victory he seeks.
He is the guilty one.
Scratched you with a toxin of my own devising.
Plenty more where that came from.
My friends and I could help with your daylight ring situation, as well.
Marcel Gerard, you were turned by an original, yet you made yourself in your own image.
You built a vampire community from ash, and this city thrived under your rule.
Let us help you return New Orleans to what it should be with you as its king.
The oldest society of vampires this world has ever known.
We are called The Strix.
Quite the prestigious organization responsible for countless wars, numerous plagues, assassinations.
You have to break rules if you want to build a new world.
You two know each other.
It's been ages since I've enjoyed a good scrap, but, uh, it's not why I'm here.
Elijah, your sire line, your life is at stake.
You want to hear what I have to say?
Marcellus, please...
And you would do well to be selective about the company you keep in future.
What ever Tristan's role in this charade may be, have no fear, I will discover it.
As I've said, I am only here to protect you.
Don't you have greater concerns than a little wolf bite that I can cure on my own?
Let's discuss these absurd murders.
It's a very interesting theory, only I don't need your protection.
I'm Mr. Castle's legal consult, here to ensure justice is served.
And, like a Phoenix, I rise.
Do think about what I said, Nik.
"Conspiring." How grandiose.
I thought I was the one with a flair for the dramatic.
Watch your tongue.
I am not the patient, fun-loving social butterfly you might recall.
The larger issue?
You've no doubt heard about the war between the sire lines.
Well, as it happens, your line, thanks to my strix, has wreaked all manner of havoc on Lucien and his assorted interests.
As a result, he's desperate to exterminate the lot of us... me, Aya, everyone you sired.
Of course, the economical way to complete this task would be for him to kill you.
While I doubt he'd have the gall to attack you directly, I believe he might try and find someone else to do it, namely Niklaus.
What makes you so certain that Niklaus would select Lucien over his own family?
From what I hear, he tortured his friend Marcel, cursed the mother of his child, and burned your paramour in front of you, all because he thought it the logical way to defeat his enemy.
With Lucien in his ear, how long before the logical thing is to get rid of you?
You have to stop him.
I'm well aware.
Logically, then, one must assume that Lucien has it or he knows where it is.
If he dies, none of us will find it, not until some other assassin attempts to use it against you.
For the record, Vincent thinks you should kill him, but you can't execute someone without, you know, due process.
Are we really going to have a legal debate about this?
Lucien has a taste for hyperbole, although in this case, he's rather on point.
Do you really think it was your blood that healed him?
I saw it with my own eyes.
When I found his body, I tried to feed him more, and... nothing.
He's the first person you ever turned.
Is that why this is so hard for you, because he's the first of your sire line?
Klaus, if he's not lying, if he is telling the truth, if he is here to help you, you don't have to kill him.
Camille, so eager to keep me from a mistake I might regret.
Lucien, no.
I know you despise me.
Ah, this change in me.
We are as alike now as brothers, are we not?
It seems so.
Yet you played right alongside him, succumbing to your savagery.
He brought out the worst in you, Niklaus.
We brought out the worst in each other.
In some ways, we made each other who we are.
Well, the moment we have that weapon, we will end him, he and Tristan.
Hey, you ok?
So now what, back to square one?
I've been feeling a little cooped up, so I've decided to cut my stay short.
Someone put my name in your kill box.
It was the Russians.
Want to tell me why the Russians give a shit whether you're alive or dead?
Because they don't want me to see something in the documents those hackers stole from you.
Saul Berenson smuggled a thumb drive out of the building and then met with Otto Düring.
There's only one person Saul would go so far out on a limb for.
_
_
Where are we?
Near Pristina.
That's off the route.
These people are helping soldiers making hijrah.
Yeah, but I didn't know that was part of the plan.
I don't tell you everything.
First, we need to rest and eat.
Why?
Nothing yet.
She'll call.
It's been over eight hours.
You said you'd be waiting there for her.
We rolled up Ahmed, didn't we?
That's not the same thing.
It amounts to the same thing.
Now the only person who can connect him to us is you.
That's why I'm exactly the wrong person to meet with her.
Why don't you just finish this once and for all?
There have been too many bodies already.
Need to be smart now.
What's worrying you?
We used to be close.
And you'll appear concerned and helpful and lead her nowhere.
Anything new?
We need to talk.
See if that line to the front desk was compromised in any way.
Where is he?
- Excuse me?
- You and I both know Saul wasn't abducted.
It's a little early to rule that out, don't you think?
This has Mossad written all over it.
I admit, it's crossed my mind.
The question is, did you aid and abet him?
- Are you kidding me?
- You insisted on taking him back to the hotel.
And did you?
What was that about?
You really want to know?
- And did you help him?
What are you getting at?
I just want Saul returned with as little damage to all our reputations as possible.
And what I'd do right now, if I were you, I'd put in a call to Tel Aviv.
So I'm fucked.
As I see it, you have two choices-- either Tovah turns you back over to the CIA or...
What?
Maybe I can get you to Israel.
You mean defect for real.
Well, it wouldn't be a defection, per se.
I don't care what you call it.
- I get out of your hair, spare you any more grief.
At the same time, give Carrie a few more days to get to the bottom of this.
- What's going on?
The Director's.
I need to see you.
Not at your office.
No, not on the phone.
Carrie, come on.
I'm Allison Stevens.
- Where'd you fly in from?
- Husband and kids?
- Uh, father and sister.
Carrie, this is Judge Samir Khalil, one of the preeminent jurists in Baghdad.
I am honored to meet the new second secretary of civil governance.
The judge is working with us in improving security in the Ministry of Justice.
I have matters of the utmost urgency to discuss.
I used to keep a little fridge in here, but, uh, the electricity's not exactly reliable.
Saul speaks highly of you.
I learned a lot from him.
Me, too.
Welcome to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
It's that bad, huh?
Yeah... and?
We've just hit 2,000 US dead since the invasion.
IEDs, EFPs, suicide bombers, death squads.
We've got it all, plus a raging insurgency, and we're supposed to build a functioning society in the middle of that.
What don't they get in Washington?
You can't shove democracy down people's throats.
Sorry.
What I need is a couple of months stateside.
To go shopping.
First thing I'm gonna do is burn every article of clothing I've worn here.
You can't get rid of the dust.
There's a little bar on a beach.
Banana Joe's.
I'm okay.
Did you find the man you were looking for?
Yeah, I did, but...
Not exactly, but I have his laptop.
No, but I can find him.
Great, thank you.
Have you seen Jonas, by any chance?
I was... just wondering if he'd asked about me or... wanted to know where I was.
Should I tell him about your situation?
No, it's fine.
I'll just get Numan, then, hmm?
And you-- you be careful.
I will.
Eight judges were killed in the last two months.
I've brought up your concerns to the first secretary on a number of occasions, and he's taken them up the chain.
You're like an echo-- repeating the same thing over and over again.
Did you know that it was here, in my country, where laws were first written down and organized into a system?
You said yesterday that you had something urgent to tell us.
And many times I've told you an investigation is underway.
He should have been arrested by now.
I doubt you'd want us to do that without any evidence.
Thank you, Ms. Orser.
Why?
Tell me.
Code name's Acrobat, and his intel, more often than not, winds up in the President's daily brief.
Jesus.
Plus, he has a thing for me.
Hey, I've been there.
Here.
Guess I should say thanks.
Weapons?
If Bibi wants you to know, he'll tell you.
We can't cross the border with weapons.
Unless Bibi wants to spend the next ten years in a Bulgarian jail that makes Plötzensee look like a health spa.
You ever been to jail?
You ever been in a war zone?
Didn't think so.
I left that vulnerable.
About three moves ago.
This is...
I know who he is.
He's the reason I catch a plane at 5:00 in the morning.
I need to speak to him alone.
You don't have the authority to throw me out.
I'll take a walk.
Well, there's something you need to know first.
If your little escapade gets out, it's an embarrassment for both our countries.
Right now my agency is working very hard to prove that you murdered General Youssef and his family.
We warned you not to pursue that strategy.
And I relayed your objections very clearly.
Still, you went ahead with the plan.
We had nothing to do with it.
It was the Russians.
How are you working on it?
The Russians have a stake in keeping Assad in power.
And Israel's enemies would love to blame the general's murder on Mossad.
They blame us for everything else.
It's not enough.
It's all I can give you.
This officer you spoke of-- do you trust her?
With my life.
In our business, that's not always a good policy.
Use the FireWire cable to connect your computer to Ahmed's.
I have to find a program I can penetrate.
How long is that gonna take?
This dude's got serious security.
Numan, how long?
30 seconds.
Or 30 minutes.
Or 30 days.
Allison's told me all about the important work you do for us.
I want you to know I'm looking forward to continuing this relationship.
I told you, I won't work with anyone else.
Do you think I'm a child?
You can tempt me with cake?
Ahmed, please... sit down.
Carrie's an experienced officer.
I've worked with many men and women like you-- patriots.
If they know I told you, they will drill holes in my head with a power tool.
I know this work is dangerous.
One mistake, I die.
We're trained to avoid making those kinds of mistakes.
Ahmed, I told you when we started that there would come a time when I would have to move on.
Do you remember how long it took for me to trust you?
You were very careful.
Why can't you stay?
This is a contract.
I take the risks, so I set the terms.
Ahmed, I bet raising a family in this city is expensive.
If there's some aspect of our relationship we can adjust to make you more comfortable...
You'll pay me more?
I'm sorry.
I don't know you... and I can't trust you.
You want the information I bring... you stay.
Ahmed, I'm... sure we can work something out.
Aw, fuck.
Do you think he's bluffing?
He's a lawyer-- it's a negotiation.
Why do you think I do this work?
It doesn't matter which officer you report to.
It matters to me.
What are you doing?
You know why I come here, why I meet with you.
Ahmed, I'm flattered.
- You feel the same way?
- I like you, but this is a professional relationship and an important one.
And you can continue that important work with Carrie.
I'm afraid I don't agree.
Is it a question of getting more money?
I don't need more money.
How did you get this?
I take a little every day in my briefcase... out the front door.
This is for us to share.
I have five more suitcases at home just like this, filled with American money.
Over $8 million.
How'd it go with Acrobat?
He went for it.
Your meeting will have to wait until he gets back.
How long will he be gone for?
Two to three weeks.
Is it set?
She wants me to walk into the village, meet her at a café.
Good.
Valentin will be there.
You said no more bodies.
I reconsidered.
Just in case she found some piece of the puzzle we haven't anticipated.
Something that connects us to Ahmed.
You never tell me the whole truth.
My job is to protect you, Alichka.
This is my first priority.
What will be your signal to Valentin?
I'll light a cigarette.
And he'll take care of her, if necessary.
Very good.
You're late.
Put the money into a trunk-- two at the most-- and I'll have it shipped out under diplomatic cover.
Here's a ticket to Geneva, where you'll make a deposit into an HSBC branch.
Then instruct them to wire the balance into this account in the West Indies.
I'll meet you there... in St. Lucia.
Ahmed, what is it?
Excuse me, please.
Go now.
You were caught red-handed, as they say.
- I'll take my chances.
- Yes, it is, and it happens to be truth.
I suggest you sit down and listen to me.
You see... this little spy game we're playing here doesn't have to be one-sided.
I can pass intelligence to you, too, Allison.
Not bullshit.
Real intelligence that will help you rise in your career, just as me recruiting you will help me rise in mine.
I mean it.
Allison... years from now, we could be looking down at this moment from a very great height.
I say let's be professionals, you and I.
I even know what you're thinking right now.
It is.
And when we are done here with this game, somewhere in the not-too-distant future, half of it will be yours.
Something to take the edge off all of the uncertainty... that frightens you so.
Gut.
The main courthouse in Baghdad has suffered a horrific attack.
The harder we try, the worse it gets.
I heard Acrobat might've been in the courthouse when it went down-- do you know if that's been confirmed?
What are you talking about?
The attack in Lebanon at General Alladia camp, that bomb was meant for me.
- Well, I'm hoping you can help me figure that out.
It all started with the cyber penetration last month.
That Ahmed Nazari was alive.
Allison, listen, did you, did you have any reason to question the intel he was providing?
Could you go back and review your old field reports with that in mind?
I-I could.
But what?
Well, they're classified for one thing.
On one condition.
Name it.
Really, I mean it.
Watch your back, Carrie.
What the fuck?
What's this all about?
We're changing trucks.
Bullshit-- you cannot take weapons into Syria.
What weapons?
_
_
_
_
_
_
Where are we going?
To someplace safe.
You're gonna catch a lot of shit for this.
Come on, come on, this way.
- I'm here.
I'm in Ahmed's computer.
We have to search it.
Yeah, for what?
Uh, it could be anything.
Sorry, but we have to narrow that down.
I thought I would have something for us to go on, but I don't.
What just happened?
Sorry, I don't understand.
That bad, huh?
Got it.
Here it is.
Oh, my God.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...
She has Elena.
And I'm the only one who knows where she is.
You will not lay a hand on another member of my family.
Give me Elena, you'll get your son back.
Once you bury the body, the grieving process begins.
Well, I'm not planning on burying her.
The Phoenix stone brings people back from the dead.
- Tell me you'll try.
I was the first love of Stefan's life.
You put that spell on me so Stefan couldn't touch me.
It's like your skin is vervain.
Stefan, meet Julian.
Julian was the man you are not supposed to fall for.
Does Stefan Salvatore know that you are pregnant with his child?
- So have you found Julian yet?
- I found him months ago.
Oh, damn it!
- Is it fixed yet?
- Not yet, sweetheart, and it's past your bedtime.
Surgery will have to resume tomorrow.
Girls?
The fact that you're here means somebody died.
No, not yet, but if you don't do exactly as I say, that could change real fast.
Jeez.
You're here at 5 A.M.
You do realize that when you get her back you're not actually getting her back, right?
And yet you're leveraging a member of my family just to get her body closer to you.
How selfish can you be?
Spare the lecture, mommy.
Damon, if you have harmed Oscar in any way...
Am I gonna catch fire?
Valerie basically turned my skin into vervain.
Let's just go shopping for Halloween costumes, and we can worry about magic later.
Well, I'm kind of already worrying about magic today.
Alaric thinks we can reunite Jo's spirit with her body by using some sketchy native American resurrection stone.
- Our lives are weird.
- Tell me about it.
How the hell did you let this happen?
And how's that working out for you?
Because from where I'm standing, she's in more danger than ever because you won't let her rest.
You spend one day with mommy dearest, and now you're on her side?
I don't have to be on her side to see what's happening here.
You can't be with Elena, so you're making all your bad decisions about Elena.
Mushroom omelettes.
Where's Oscar?
I suppose I've taken the notion of trust for granted lately.
Lorenzo, would you mind terribly if I had a moment alone with Valerie.
Is something wrong?
Just some family business.
I spent yesterday with Stefan, learned all about your little tryst in 1863.
I was a foolish human back then.
I'm sorry.
I will only say this once.
If you have anything to tell me, anything at all, now is the time.
I have nothing to hide.
I should go look for Oscar.
That won't be necessary.
God, it feels good to come out of that deserted town and be around living, breathing people we can eat.
Mystic Falls is the prison world all over again.
We're on a mission, Nora, not a vacation.
Damon, open the...
Lily must have had the wrong address for the hostage exchange.
- Where's Oscar?
- You just missed him.
You reek of blood.
And I've been judging.
I lost my one and only bargaining chip.
Then why isn't Oscar answering his phone?
Maybe the guy doesn't want to be found.
Why don't I believe you?
I'll throw that away for you.
We're not doing anything illegal, officer.
Besides violating a town-wide quarantine and putting these people's lives at risk to make a quick buck?
Pack it up and get out of here.
The mysterious figure haunting the clock tower?
Don't waste the ammunition, mate.
Waste of taxpayer money, and I am one of your last taxpayers.
What do you want, Enzo?
Or you could grant me access to the town surveillance cameras.
Have a heretic to track.
Oh, and he keeps getting better.
Well, Stefan, she was your first love, and then she just left you hanging.
You're not the least bit curious why?
She hasn't contacted me in the 4 months she's been back, so I'm assuming she's as over it as I am.
Unfortunately, she's the heretic that I am the least concerned about right now.
Let's just say that it involves two bored mean girls on a campus full of easy targets, but fortunately, I have come up with a genius plan to keep them occupied while Damon sorts out his Oscar problem.
I think the hardest part will be feigning enthusiasm.
Unless they think it's their idea.
We still have 13 minutes.
What's this?
Stefan invited me, but I don't know.
These days, Halloween just seems like an excuse to get drunk and show skin.
Halloween's only for people who dress up as psychopaths.
As if we'd want to drink cheap beer out of plastic and then brag about it all over the Internet.
As if you'd even know how to do that.
We're going.
To a college party?
What's that supposed to mean?
Seriously, you guys have nothing to feel self-conscious about.
Try being gay in 1900.
What do you care about some silly spell?
You don't even like Valerie.
I've had to endure two lifetimes with that conniving shrew, and I've learned that when it comes to Val you don't get on her bad side.
Not happening, Stefan.
That's not the Valerie that I knew.
Well, I used to be a sickly, abused, little urchin cast out by my coven, and then I met Mary Louise.
Love changes people.
You want a devil?
Well, what better way to spend Halloween, huh?
Well, if it makes any difference, this is worth some serious extra credit.
Oh, you think?
Well, that's too bad because we got to bring this guy back to life.
Oh, thank you.
You weren't, oh, I don't know, already coming to this and just, uh, forgot to invite me?
I didn't forget to invite you.
I just felt like a Halloween party wasn't great first date material.
Torture.
Oh, they're here.
A Bijou for me and a Crème Yvette for my little flower here.
A Gin Martini and a Sex on the Beach.
Gotcha.
I love it.
Beg your pardon?
I'm obsessed.
Obsessed.
Scratch that one off the list.
I think it's creating a bridge between the body and the spirit.
I just have to find a spell that makes that bridge permanent.
So how goes the diversion?
How much longer?
Oh, crap Ric, put it out.!
Think we're close.
I guess all it takes is a scolding from Lily to ruin breakfast.
We have an ice box full of blood downstairs, you know.
Yeah, but sometimes, it's nice to get out of the house, take a drive, get out of town, come back.
Are you accusing me of something?
Town surveillance has you on the road to and from Whitmore last night in a stolen car.
Curious how Oscar was also at Whitmore last night and has since mysteriously disappeared, so... heh... yes, I am accusing you of something.
I'm just not sure whether it's lying to Lily or murder or both.
Forget everything you think you know because you are wrong in ways you cannot even imagine.
I had to prevent him from bringing a monster back into Lily's life.
What monster is that?
Julian.
You don't know.
I guess Lily doesn't tell you everything.
Who's Julian, Valerie?
Someone you'll want to keep as far away as possible, assuming that one day you want Lily to love you in the same way that you love her.
See, Nora wants some breathing room, but Mary Louise is scared if she gives it to her then Nora's gonna leave her.
You got all that from that?
Well, it's obvious.
Or not.
You know, I'd ask you to dance, but...
If only there was a person that you could talk to about it.
I will ask Valerie to undo it once Damon brings Oscar back to life.
Well, she's back now, and you're scared that you're gonna look her in the eye and all of your feelings are gonna come back, you know, the infatuation and the abandonment and the whole freaking fairytale.
That's what I'm scared of, or that's what you're scared of?
Where did you go?
I'm just tipsy enough to enjoy this music.
Have a taste.
Oh, don't pretend that was anything other than petty jealousy.
This trashy girl wouldn't mean a damn thing to you if you weren't so desperate for attention!
I'm going to finish what we came here to do.
Well, which one was that?
It's something I found in one of your shamanistic oral traditions.
Oh, my God.
Easy there, buddy.
Where am I?
How did I get here?
Well, we'll talk about it on the way.
Smile for mommy.
Either our friend still has the munchies, or this ravenous hunger is a side effect of resurrection.
If hunger is the worst consequence of the stone spell, then we got off easy.
No offense, Ric, but I was asking Bonnie.
Trick or treat?
I've been tricked enough today.
I still haven't heard a peep from the girls since they left.
Who's Julian?
Well, that's nonsense.
He was the love of my life.
You're done here.
Where's Nora?
Trust me, I don't.
Is this how relationships work in the modern era, everybody peddling their flesh like a street bazaar?
Because bloody Nora seems quite interested in the browsing.
You know, these days, they have this wonderful thing called a therapist.
How old do you think I am?
I could think of nothing more futile that prattling on about one's emotions.
As if I can prevent Nora from drifting away if I only find the right words.
Or as if confronting my first love will somehow make her disappear.
I'm gonna need more.
Not till we get our story straight.
I've never been to Myrtle Beach.
How deep does this amnesia go?
Well, that was the last one.
Well, then you're gonna have to stop this thing!
Not until you get one right.
Don't shoot the one person who can solve this case for you, detective dumb-ass.
I've been tracking him through the woods.
Damon, it's Halloween.
There'll be ghost tours going through Mystic Falls every 30 minutes.
I'm coming with you.
Donavan, that badge does not take away the fact that you are human.
Please don't commit suicide by heretic tonight.
Since when do you care?
Give me a break.
I don't want to add your death to a long list of things that are already my fault.
Siphon the repulsion spell off of Caroline, or your girlfriend dies.
Get away from her!
Grab my arm and siphon or keep burning.
Did it work?
Well, that was a lot more satisfying than I thought it would be.
Now I get it.
Your favorite sons are the ones with the ripper problems.
I highly recommend a detox and an intervention.
I'm going to find them and rip their heads off and smash them together like two disgusting melons and...
- Why are you smiling?
- I can't help it.
We've been on our own, scorned, abused, imprisoned for so long.
I've forgotten that this world is meant to be enjoyed, not feared.
Right now, there's a tour bus full of corpses in the cemetery because I didn't do anything stupid.
Well, I'm in danger of being exiled from my family because I did something extra stupid.
Join me for a drink?
1... 2... 3.
Stick to tourists.
Or you're planning your escape.
Only a matter of time before Oscar sobers up and fingers you as his would-be murderer, which clearly you're bloody awful at.
What do you want, Enzo?
I want, dear, not so innocent Valerie, for you to tell me how we're going to prevent Julian from walking back into Lily's life.
After everything you've been through, what a shame it would be to lose her because you're too terrified to find out who you actually are without her.
"Dear Elena, yes, you heard that correctly.
"So who is Damon Salvatore without Elena Gilbert?"
"A selfish friend"...
"Until you come back to me."
Should be nine more workers inside, just rotated on shift.
Liz needs all the help she can get.
Next time, i break that arm.
Because after far too much time playing defense, today is the day we switch to offense.
Take a look around, we're hardly in prime position to be fighting anyone right now.
The director needed permission to have me killed, and he only got it by convincing others that I didn't have the fulcrum.
That was a costly mistake.
We need to capitalize on that by wreaking such havoc on the cabal that they will choose to exonerate you, and sacrifice the director.
How is that ever gonna happen?
Our journey begins in the home of the double bacon corn dog.
Welcome to Iowa.
Damaging one building will hardly kill verdiant.
That's a trade secret worth billions of dollars.
You and I are going to take those files from the men who stole them.
Assuming we could do that, why would we?
Verdiant launders money for the cabal, hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
If we get those files, we have leverage over verdiant.
We have leverage over verdiant, we have leverage over the cabal.
I know how Mr. reddington and agent keen got out of the diner where the standoff happened.
The tunnels, the ones they used to escape from the diner, they were built to sneak in contraband from the port of Baltimore.
One particular freighter caught our attention.
Container number 358202 was off-loaded and placed on a westbound flatbed at 12:23 A.M.
Stowed away in a corrugated sardine can.
The glamorous life of an international fugitive...
What is it?
Dembe.
This is the rendezvous point.
Something's wrong.
We're going to need transportation.
I'm not talking to you.
Dembe's missing.
And when I refused to answer their questions, they took me in...
I'm clean as a whistle, which is more than I can say for your shorts.
I could hear you dropping a steamer through the phone.
He won't.
Nothing?
So be it.
What you hear next is a consequence of your misplaced loyalty.
Please, no!
You are members of los segadores, am I right?
Goons working for verdiant?
Either way, I'm not telling you...
The next one goes in your leg.
Eli matchett.
I don't.
Look, verdiant has a warehouse up in silver Ridge, doing some top-secret research.
We were working on how to take it out when Eli, he just snapped.
We're going to need Mr. costa's address, and maybe some directions.
My associate prefers to steal cars made before the advent of GPS.
Sorry, friends, but I got something else in mind.
Sure is one hell of a sardine can.
Twenty-five years ago, Hanover was a low-level staffer on the hill.
A bombing with a direct link to the cabal.
How many employees were lost?
They say some of the bodies are unidentifiable.
Maybe Gabriel costa's our inside man.
How long will you need?
Costa isn't here.
Then we look for anything that may reveal his whereabouts.
I don't know what happened.
I used to consider myself lucky.
That's kind of sweet, actually.
Well, it was an apt nickname.
Then one day, he got a tip from a source about a piece sitting in a huge loft in soho.
Did he take it?
Sometimes bad luck is the best luck you'll ever have.
There's something going on with that vent.
Time to go.
No, but I pulled this off a responding officer's dash-cam, he was dispatched to meet us at the scene.
Looks like costa was copying verdiant documents and feeding them to matchett and his crew.
He kept this ledger to keep track of the documents he stole.
He's got internal memos here tracking some development project called "Genesis".
Where are we?
Four hundred tiny viral vectors, ready to be released into the wild.
Is the chicken gorgonzola gluten-free?
Why don't I ask the chef.
Gabriel costa.
Have your officers secure the vehicle and stand down until we get there.
Patrol found the car. 355 mission.
What is this place?
Let's get what we need and go.
That's the car.
Clear.
Think if you stare long enough, it might ring?
What's her name?
Matchett didn't steal verdiant's genome blueprint so he could release it publicly.
If matchett unleashes this virus, we could have a global food crisis on our hands.
I'll check the parking lot, find us a new ride.
In fact, they bought out several other places in that area and turned them into one large industrial farm.
I think we just found ourselves ground zero.
Must be my lucky day.
Some idea, yes.
Pockets.
They wouldn't have a thoracic surgeon on call, they'd have to medevac him to a different county.
What does that tell you?
And Eduardo, this morning at the segadores farm?
Possible suspect sighting, stand by.
You boys about finished?
He's all yours.
I think from agent keen.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You paid him to attack that facility.
You wanted him to steal that data.
Why would we do that?
A stockpile of new seed, waiting to be sold to a desperate world on the verge of calamity.
You would have made a fortune and looked like heroes in the process.
He seized his chance to terrify the world, shine one glorious spotlight on the dangers of planting the same seed in fields all over the globe.
Please, tell him I'm coming.
I shot a cop.
Bad things are going to find you now, lizzy.
This life has a mind and a momentum of its own.
That's a reality you need to accept.
Bad things happen to good people.
You know, I've watched you run the task force all this time and I don't think i ever appreciated how damn hard it was.
I'll deny it if you ever repeat it, but there wasn't a day when I didn't feel i was in over my head.
You made the right call.
Red, yeah, hey, it's me.
I think he's been taken.
The price of silence.
We're going to die in here.
In case you get tired of waiting.
You turned Hook into a Dark One?
Job well done, Emma!
Father, Father!
Now... remember, whenever you feel scared, all you have to do is look inside.
We're all braver than we think if we just look deep enough.
Before you know it, you're gonna be a man, so I'm just trying to prepare you 'cause then you're gonna have to answer life's big question.
What kind of man are you going to be?
I want to be just like you.
Well, that's a nice answer, son.
Now, close your eyes and find that brave part deep inside yourself, hmm?
Go to sleep.
Are you looking for your father?
Rowed away?
He's a thief, a fugitive from the law.
He heard there were soldiers waiting at the next port, so he bought my old rowboat... and left.
Why would he leave us?
How do you think he paid for the boat?
Now you know what kind of man your father really is.
Last time we fought, this sword ended up at your neck.
Watch it, pirate.
This is why Belle's left you, isn't it?
She knows just what kind of man you really are.
Mmm, remember how good it felt?
Oh, is that right?
We may be down a dwarf, but we're ready to fight.
But he did because of me.
This is a man you loved.
So, no matter how hard this might be... we need to split up, find him, and stop him... no matter what it takes.
And you think we'll find Hook just sipping rum by the sea?
He's not exactly a pirate anymore.
Careful who you sneak up on.
I'd like to have a little chat about my daughter.
I'm going to teach her how to be wicked.
You try and take my daughter from me...
There's no point in us fighting over our darling baby girl because, soon enough, you'll both be dead, and... then I can just take her.
Dark One, stand back!
Behind you!
Henry, don't move!
Too late for that.
What is that?
That... is the mark of Charon.
Charon?
Smart lad.
You see, the Dark Ones only have a... a temporary pass into this world, like a like a tourist visa.
The only way for them to stay... is to trade places with living souls.
Meaning us?
Exactly.
And when the moon reaches its peak, the ferry from the underworld will arrive... and drag us down there.
That doesn't sound good.
Speaking as one who's died and been there, it's not.
So, how do we stop it?
We can't.
The underworld is worse than you can possibly imagine.
And then the realization will hit... that death has already come, and this fresh torture is all that's left.
Gold, you're scaring Henry.
Good, because we should all be scared.
Thought I might find you somewhere with a view of the sea.
Oh, there's no use in hiding now.
I understand you think Emma betrayed you, but do you really think dragging her family to the underworld's the answer?
This from the woman who enacted the dark curse to punish Snow White for telling a secret.
You of all people should know how far someone will go for revenge.
And, unfortunately for you, so do all the people you've killed who are waiting for you in hell.
I'm not that person anymore.
Oh, tell yourself what you want, love.
You may be the Dark One, but we both know you aren't the man you were when I recruited you to kill my mother.
When I... tested you... and when you
Not... another... word.
I think you've had enough.
I want you sharp for what you must do next.
I will kill your mother, and in exchange, you will bring me to a land without magic, where I can finally get my revenge on Rumplestiltskin.
And I need to make sure you have none.
Shut up.
And get in the carriage.
Ah, a test, is it?
I've been a pirate for over 100 years, and my hook has tasted the blood of dozens.
Gold has to be missing something, right?
There has to be a way to escape this mark.
Maybe Gold's right.
Maybe this is a fight we can't win.
I will not give up on my own family.
I know you won't stop trying.
And I hope you succeed, but... promise me that you'll... come meet us at Granny's, come say goodbye.
I promise.
I love you, Emma.
I love you, too.
Do you remember the promise you made in Camelot... to do whatever was necessary to get rid of the darkness?
I don't like where this is going.
I need you to keep that promise now.
And I need you to swear not to tell anyone else.
But to get rid of the darkness, you still have to put it in someone... and sacrifice them.
Who?
Me.
- O-okay, here, here.
This will save you from harm when you're crossing the town line.
A-am I going somewhere?
Well, that's up to you.
I just want you to... live out your dream.
Okay, look... here.
You... you take the car, say goodbye to your father, and then start living.
We're closed.
Please, go away.
I bet there are a lot of people in the underworld who would be thrilled to see you and me.
Excalibur was always destined... for the hands of a true hero.
That's it?
You don't want to make a deal or something?
No.
You're a brave woman, Emma Swan... but it might not work.
It doesn't matter.
Robin and I need to protect Roland and the baby from Zelena.
I'll catch up with you later.
So, just a man?
Oh, I'm pretty sure you'll know which one I mean.
Face him, and you'll prove you have what it takes to face my mother.
I'm not sure I see...
Oh, for heaven sakes.
Father?
At the moment, I'm trying to decide what color would look best on your walls.
Oh, my God, I just realized that all three of those work as baby names.
It's all just coming together.
Cheeky.
You're not moving in, sis.
Well, perhaps I'm slightly premature, but in an hour, you'll both be dead, then everything that's yours... will be mine.
And that's not with you.
Uh, if memory serves, the last time you tried to use it, you weren't powerful enough to make it work.
If my memory serves... last time, I didn't believe in myself.
But now I do, as does everyone in this town.
So, let's go somewhere, just the two of us.
Somewhere over the rainbow!
Why might I cause trouble?
Because I'm a dirty pirate?
Or because I'm a boy whose father abandoned him on the high seas?
Well, Father... this is who I became!
How is this possible?
I left nearly a century ago.
Liam... was not so fortunate.
Neverland.
I was biding my time until I found a way to kill myself a crocodile.
It's a tale of woe and revenge but one that you don't need to be concerned with.
It's your tale that matters.
Oh, I'm sorry, Killian.
A sleeping curse?
How the bloody hell are you awake now?
How does anyone break a curse?
True love's kiss.
Where is this woman?
A few years... after we married she fell ill.
I came here to kill you, Father.
Your life was the price I had to pay to finally get my revenge.
In a manner of speaking.
I can secure you a letter of transit to take you far from this place.
Maybe you can start again.
You'll come with me?
You can't destroy the plague that took yours, but I can destroy the plague that took mine.
I must continue on.
Actually... would it be possible... to bring two?
Two?
My wife and I... we had a son.
If I do not do this, everyone I love will die.
And if you do, you'll die.
This is not who Killian wanted to be.
Well, now I can finally make the Crocodile pay.
Even if it means becoming the thing you hate?
The thing you spent centuries trying to destroy?
I couldn't watch one more person I love die.
And now, because of that, you get to watch everyone you love die.
No!
I will protect my family, even if I have to kill you to do it!
Mom, wait!
It's too late for that, Swan.
Enjoy the time you have left with your family.
- What's wrong?
You don't have to worry.
Captain Hook's already seen to that.
Which means there's no way to stop your trip to the underworld.
Neal's back at the diner!
Roland and the baby where are they?
It's time to drop the act.
You can't just sit back and watch another family be destroyed to get your revenge.
What makes you think I can't?
Because of what we swore to never speak of again.
I know the real reason you don't want to talk about what you did to your father.
I believe we've already had this conversation.
But this time you're going to listen because if you don't... you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life, which, in your case, means forever.
So, you have to ask yourself the same question you did that night.
What kind of man do you want to be?
You and I will find another home.
And remember... whenever you're scared, all you have to do is look... inside.
I'll see you in the morning, Liam.
Thank you, Killian.
Was he really that easy to replace?
So I'd remember never to make the same mistake.
No, people don't change.
You're just not worth it.
It's time.
No, you're not taking the people I love!
I might not be able to kill you, but I can stop you from interfering.
That's enough!
What do you think you're doing?
Being the man I want to be.
You can't stop us.
Yes, I can.
Killian, you can't do this.
We both know there's no other way, love.
Your family needs you.
If anyone deserves to go to the underworld, it's me.
I love you.
I love you, too.
It's okay.
What are you doing here?
For the first time, you were truly selfless.
You know, I don't need to see the world to know what I want anymore.
What I want is to be with you.
You're upset, imagining things.
You have it, don't you?
Yes, I do.
You are the Dark One.
- Again.
But then, most ex-Dark Ones are dead.
A chance I had never imagined would present itself again.
As fate would have it, a small vial of magic was close at hand.
One sprinkle... and I knew I could get it all back.
I turned the sword into a conduit.
Into you.
He had no idea.
And now... things are as they should be.
Hook sacrificed himself, and you took that from him!
Do you honestly think that you can hurt me?
I now have the combined power of every Dark One who ever lived... including you.
You found a loophole, betrayed us all again.
It's what I do.
It's the man I am.
Well, then, Dark One... now that you have your power back... you're going to do something for me.
And why would I do anything for you?
The underworld.
That's quite a distinction.
To get him back, someone else will have to die.
It could work.
It will work.
Uh, forgive me if I'm missing the obvious, but, um, how does one get to the underworld?
Do it.
That's too steep for me.
Uh, you go.
Bennie, you okay?
Oh, my God!
Wait.
This isn't my bone.
You all right, Bennie?
Actually, I'd prefer it if we didn't do that.
Oh, that sounds like a blast.
Must've been a gnarly landing.
The sub-pubic angle of the pelvis tells me that the victim was a female.
Bone density suggests that she was around her mid-20s.
Well, and surface flesh is pretty much gone, but not from decomposition.
The ribs appear to have received multiple fractures, uh, from the impact of the bicycle.
Yeah, the heels would suggest otherwise.
Dried blood.
Well, there's more blood over here.
Drag marks.
So her body was thrown down there.
Someone was trying to get rid of her.
Yeah, well, I guess they didn't try hard enough.
She was wearing something stretchy.
Congratulations.
Booth wants to leave a dollar under her pillow and pretend it came from a fairy.
Well, aren't you concerned it insults his intelligence?
Well, no complaints from Michael Vincent so far.
It appears the trauma to the ribs and the upper body were not all caused by the bike.
The victim also suffered extensive antemortem injuries that have since remodeled.
Perhaps she was previously in an accident.
This damage was not caused by a discrete event.
The remodeling of the ischia and both clavicles indicate it was incurred over the course of the last decade.
You're right-- the acromioclavicular ligament shows signs of repeated dislocation.
I'm also seeing signs of expanded articulation of the glenoid fossae.
Her shoulders were repeatedly displaced out of their socket.
There's something unusual in the upper esophageal sphincter.
Let's see.
Do you think she was force-fed this?
But it feels like there could be scarring on the trachea.
All right, but what about that one?
That one's good, but I like this one.
Right, I should've thought of that.
Then there'd be no point in my being here.
I'm back in town and wanted to see how Angela's work has progressed.
But evidently, you need Angela for other things.
Thank you, I do.
Then I won't get in your way.
Wow, that's a total mess.
Well, it might be enough to extrapolate a partial pattern.
I'll cross-reference these against the matches from my facial reconstruction.
We found our victim.
We'vegotno missing person's report on Klarissa Mott at D.C. Metro and no known relatives in the D.C. area.
We're here to see Anna Lloyd.
Anna and I just started a catering business.
Oh, my God, that's horrible.
Hmm, were you two close?
Can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt her?
Not that I knew of.
Straightjackets and handcuffs.
She was a magician?
I said that once to her and she corrected me.
Usually, yes, but this car is too technologically advanced for you.
Bones, I know how to fly a helicopter, all right?
And besides, this car's as user-friendly as it gets.
I have to admit it is easy to drive.
And when the car's not moving, Christine enjoys playing with the reclining rear seats.
Brennan.
I found burn marks on our victim.
Just let me drive.
I am a scientist.
Science's primary aim is to search for the truth.
Let's not bring the Tooth Fairy into this, okay?
Well, Christine needs to know that her baby teeth fall out for a reason, not so she can get ice cream money from an imaginary goblin.
Ice cream that will, ironically, cause her to lose more teeth.
It's not a goblin, it's a fairy, okay?
The Great Lafayette's dog leash.
Hi, can I help you?
Oh, hello.
We called her apartment, and her roommate told us the horrible news.
Right, so how long has she been working for you?
Oh, I met her years ago when she was doing street magic on the National Mall.
So you gave Klarissa her start, then.
Yes, I could see her talent immediately, and it paid off, because her shows were just groundbreaking.
Groundbreaking in what sense?
Well, that could be the result of a neurological imbalance.
Did she have any enemies at the club?
Well, the Palace is an incubator for young talent, and everyone's always jostling for stage time.
Whom did she replace?
All right, follow me.
Whoa, you seeing what I'm seeing?
Perhaps the cause of Klarissa's burns.
I pulled a few pranks.
We all do that.
Oh, so it was her fault?
And usually, she would have caught it without burning herself.
So why didn't she this time?
What do you mean distracted?
Now, I-I don't know what was going on, but something big was definitely changing in her life.
Don't insinuate things.
I didn't hurt that woman.
And whatever fun I had with her-- listen to me-- she gave it right back.
Dr. Brennan, take a look at this perimortem damage.
I'm seeing fractures of the left orbital socket, maxilla and zygomatic.
You know, I never saw Klarissa Mott perform, but I did attend several shows at the Magic Palace though for the last few years.
I had no idea you were a fan of magic, Dr. Edison.
And I take it you're not.
No, nor of witchcraft, astrology or the lotto, all of which require one to relinquish rational thought.
Oh, Dr. Saroyan, you're just in time.
Her liver shows high levels of the opiate Dilaudid.
Icombedthrough Klarissa's bank account to see if I could get a whiff of this big shift in her behavior.
For the past few months, she would withdraw 340 bucks from the same ATM machine in Glover Park every Wednesday afternoon.
Glover Park?
Well, Dr. Brennan, you see, she has a problem giving Christine a buck for her tooth.
Oh, gotcha.
Yeah, well, what's that have to do with this?
I'm just saying, she might know something that we don't know.
The world changed.
Okay, but what's interesting is what happens next.
This guy in the black hoodie, look at what happens when he leaves.
Ran a background check on the current tenant of 331 Oakton.
FBI, open up.
Look, we know that Klarissa came to you for Dilaudid.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I use my hands and my body weight to loosen muscle, fascia, tendons.
I work with athletes, performers, all types of people.
We also know that she came here and dropped off, what, $340 in cash to you every Wednesday.
Jesus, you Feds really got nothing better to do than to bust my nards about trying to make a living?
No, we want to bust your nards for murder.
And you think that...
I don't even have cold medicine in this place.
They're anonymous, but they all originated from a public library in Maryland.
I'm sure it is.
Will you stop?
Look, any magicians ever accuse Klarissa of stealing tricks?
Lenny.
Junior.
The guy's kid?
Yes, it is suggestive of a defensive wound.
Seems that it's been made by a sharp object, perhaps a large blade.
Dr. Edison, may I ask you a question?
Of course.
Well, the truth is magic got me through a really rough patch in middle school.
Well, adolescence can be difficult, particularly for children of superior intellect.
Dr. Brennan, would you allow me to perform a magic trick for you?
I don't think the Jeffersonian is a place for games.
Please, indulge me for a moment.
It's a little experiment in weird science.
Observe as I take this half dollar and place it in my hand.
I'm about to cause a little-known anomaly to the laws of physics.
If I hold this flame at the right distance from the coin, it will completely, somehow, dematerialize.
Now that you're done, we can return to our work.
Wouldn't you like to know how this magic trick was accomplished?
Mm-hmm, I thought so.
I want my son's lawyer here before he answers any of your questions.
I mean, do you really want to watch your son mingle with a bunch of bad prisoners?
It's an escapist move where I'm locked in a vat of Scotch.
It was my signature trick 20 years ago.
Dr. Edison, please re-examine the area around the sharp force trauma on the left ulna.
I believe this mark and the previous mark were made simultaneously.
Which suggests they were both the result of one blow from a single weapon.
Well, the first mark was made at a 94-degree angle and the second one is... 135 degrees.
The Jeffersonian is the home of truth and scientific inquiry.
Actually, he showed me this one, and I'm pretty sure you're not gonna be able to figure it out.
Proceed.
If I put it in the water and concentrate hard enough it'll disappear.
The spoon is made of gallium.
You've got to be kidding me.
You cover the beaker with your hand to conceal the chemical process of the solid spoon turning to liquid metal.
I see.
Well, if you ever change your mind, you know how to find me.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
There is nothing going on between Sebastian and I.
I mean, I'm a happily married woman.
I know that.
So, um, what-what's really going on?
But isn't it nice that someone is interested?
I mean, especially a good-looking guy like that?
Good-looking and that accent.
Well, that's just it.
But you definitely won't if you don't try.
So I spoke to a dozen or so members of the Magic Palace about Klarissa's dating life.
You wanted to show me something, Dr. Edison?
And I have located some bone bruising and microfractures of the greater cornua of the bone.
Maybe it's good for Cam to start seeing other people.
What, you think it's too soon?
No, you wouldn't, okay?
People, they say that all the time.
Look what happened to Sweets.
What happened with you and your brother.
Ah, just stop, all right?
Hold on, that's Cam.
Go ahead, Cam.
I re-examined some neck tissue that I thought had been bruised by animal predation.
Turns out, the marks were caused by acute urticaria.
Yeah, he was cooking with some fancy truffle oil in her apartment.
Your fancy truffle oil was on Klarissa's neck.
I left that oil at Anna's place.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Come on, Victor.
Look, what really happened between you and Klarissa, huh?
I have an eyewitness who saw you kissing Klarissa in front of the Palace.
We were supposed to meet up at her place later that night... but she never showed up.
You didn't text her or ask her why?
If it was so casual, then why'd you send her flowers?
What flowers?
So someone else sent them.
Maybe you found out about this other guy and got jealous.
Did your girlfriend know about all this?
There's a chance she caught on to it.
I could see that there was something off about Anna.
She was looking for something.
She find it?
We learned that your boyfriend was having an affair with Klarissa Mott.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
No, not at all.
You have to be kidding me.
So you found out about the affair, and that's why you killed Klarissa.
I just didn't want to hurt our business, so I... chose to look the other way.
So are you saying that you were okay with that?
So we also checked out your alibi.
Now, you said that you were at the convention.
When we brought your boyfriend in, we looked into his finances, and we found your catering company credit card.
You bought gas and groceries in Washington the night Klarissa was murdered.
I wasn't sure they were having an affair, so I wanted to see for myself.
That's why I lied about coming home early.
You lied about your knowledge of the affair, you lied about when you came home.
I'll tell you what, Anna, all this lying is adding up, and it's not looking good for you.
You have something to show me, Dr. Edison?
Now, do you notice the sequential pattern here?
34.5 millimeters, equidistant.
Perhaps these marks were made by the same alloy object that injured Klarissa's ulna.
Have Hodgins swab for particulates.
Not gonna believe this one-- the Gold Pearl Casino.
Dr. Hodgins, what is all this doing in the lab?
Yeah, we scoured the institution's archives, and we pulled out memorabilia, devices.
In an effort to find the weapon that may have killed Klarissa Mott.
I don't recall there being any kerf marks on the victim's bones.
Perhaps, but this is the saw that Harry Blackstone Sr., first used to cut a woman in half.
This is all entirely useless.
You are both grown men and, to the best of my knowledge, scientists.
Please tell me that despite your enthusiasm for magic, you have discovered something of value that can help move this case forward.
All right, well, I did swab the bruised areas of the mandible, and I found traces of the same alloy that was in the trauma to the left ulna.
So the damage on the ulna and mandible were both caused by the same weapon?
Finally, I'm seeing something useful.
I remember seeing this lock and chain in Lenny Jay's memorabilia cabinet.
He had the arrogance to display it in full view.
Okay, let's see if I can enhance it.
Hmm, the padlock's edges appear to be the same angles as the cut on the victim's arm.
That is my hypothesis.
Okay, well, I've already scanned Klarissa Mott's bones, so let's go full-skeleton.
We need to see if these angles correspond to the padlock's dimensions.
Okay, well, there's only one way to find that out.
It's a perfect match.
Now, please see if the chain links line up with the damage to the mandible.
Okay, so the killer swung the lock and chain, and a sharp corner of the padlock cut Klarissa's left arm.
Which she was holding up to protect herself.
Then the killer wrapped the weapon around Klarissa's neck and strangled her.
She fell to the floor, landing on her face, causing the damage to the maxilla and zygomatic.
We need that lock and chain, but Lenny Jay must have gotten rid of it.
Perhaps not, he's arrogant.
Solely due to his aptitude for trickery, he thinks he's smarter than us.
What do we got, anything?
You cleaned the lock, but you were unable to wipe down the internal casings.
This clotting matches the exact frequency of luminescence of the blood sampling extracted from Klarissa Mott's remains.
Hmm, gotcha.
And she promised me that she would spend her entire career here at the Palace.
In the time it takes to get a DNA sample from that lock, he could have prepared a different story.
I thought it was best to confront him when his guard was down.
Occasionally, a touch of deception goes a long way.
Bones, even you are capable of a little magic.
Which is why I slipped a dollar under Christine's pillow when I kissed her good night.
What do you have there?
Oh, I'm just finishing up some paperwork on the Lenny Jay case.
Oh, perfect.
No.
How did you do that?
I did that very well, thank you very much.
There must be a logical explanation for this amateur trick.
A little mystery is good for the soul.
Did you plant it in the dryer?
Well, you were at work, so how did you...?
Bones, a magician never reveals his secrets.
Sebastian, hi, it's Cam Saroyan.
This song is such an awesome way to start every morning.
It's a nice way of showing the gods how much we appreciate everything they'll do... once they take us out those doors to the Great Beyond.
We always felt we had a special bond
Take us to the Great Beyond
Where we're sure Nothing bad happens to food
Once we're out the sliding doors Things will all be grand
We will live our dreams together In the Promised Land
The gods control our fate So we all know we're in good hands
We're super sure there's nothing shitty Waiting for us in the Great Beyond
Everyone else is fuckin' stupid
Except for those who think like me
And me!
We'll exterminate the juice
Und subjugate The whole damn Great Beyond
But once we're out the doors It's not a sin
For us to let you Slip it in
The gods will always care for us
They won't squeeze us out their butts
I'm going to the Great Beyond, motherfuckers!
Dudes, basically every single sausage... gets chosen on Red, White and Blue Day.
More like 3 inches deep for Barry, you deformed nerd.
Troy, that's funny.
You see, this is why I can't wait for the Great Beyond.
We'll all be equal, and then jerks like Troy won't be picking on me all the time... on account of my abnormality.
I'm sure there's some kind of smushed bun out there waiting for me.
Fuck you, wienies.
Fuck, I hate this fucking job!
That's super fucked up about Bill and those guys.
They work in mysterious ways.
Look at these big old buns.
Here's my impression of that:
I mean, honestly, guys... who in this package would ever let Carl get up in them?
And when a bun this fresh is into you, all you ask is when and how deep.
And the answer is:
As soon as we get to the Great Beyond and as deep as she'll let me.
I'm gonna talk to her.
So looks like tomorrow's the big day, huh?
You and me, finally gonna be official.
I'm so happy the gods put our packages together.
It's like we were made for each other.
I don't know how well I'll perform once it happens.
Look, okay, I know it's against the rules, but I can't wait anymore.
I need to just feel you.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
As soon as we got out those doors...
So you have learned the terrible truth.
Congratulations!
Now keep it to yourself, or I will slit your throat while you sleep.
He's gone.
Where the fuck did he go?
Oh, please, god.
This is so cool!
I'm on my way!
Somebody call a doctor because, honestly, this beat is sick.
Oh, shit, Chips!
C-H-I-P-S, Chips, Chips, Chips.
I will tell you very much that you look fucking disgusting, bro.
Oh, come on.
What are you, even?
What do you mean, what am I, dude?
I'm a fucking douche!
You know how long I've been waiting up in this motherfucker?
I was starting to worry the gods didn't want douches no more, but look at her.
She's a fucking 10, bro.
The Great Beyond is bullshit!
No, I'm not all right.
I've seen that shit, and there ain't no way I'm going back.
Wait, you've been to the Great Beyond?
"Great," my asshole!
They ain't gonna get Honey Mustard twice.
Fuck you, gods!
I've got a date with oblivion.
Barry, help!
- Oh, fuck, Carl, what do we do?
You want proof?
Talk to Firewater.
That bastard bottle of booze seems to know what's going on.
No!
- Oh, my God.
"MILF." Thank you so much.
Well, Barry, I guess now you're weird and a pussy.
Add that to your list of accomplishments.
I could still... get up in there.
Oh, my God.
Yo, did you two do this to me?
Are you two responsible for my nozzle being irrepressibly fucked up?
Yeah, Banana's whole face peeled off.
Come at me, bros.
Look out!
No!
I can't believe you got out of your package.
There is no Great Beyond without you, Frank.
Well, according to Honey Mustard, there might not be a Great Beyond at all.
Yeah, yeah, I heard him talking about the gods... all over our faces, and then I saw him die.
Don't touch me.
A bagel trying to kill a lavash, once again.
The only thing I've ever pushed is my peaceful agenda.
I was just trying to save Frank.
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Hey, who you calling useless, you flappy fuck?
Let's try to be, I don't know, amicable.
Really?
Well, fuck all of you!
I am Kareem Abdul Lavash!
And what I currently care about is that I have been... completely and utterly fucked out of being in the Great Beyond.
I am to have 77 bottles of extra-virgin olive oil... waiting for me.
I am destined to soak up their sweet juices... as they dribble down my flaps.
Oh, believe me, asshole, I'll keep my distance.
No disrespect, but you look fucking gross, bro.
Why would a god let you up in her smooth, perfect sliz... when you can't even squirt?
You got nothing to squirt!
I got no purpose.
I'm nothing!
Oh, God.
Is someone there?
Help.
No, not fucking you, dummy.
If you fucking tell anyone about this, I'm gonna deny it, bro.
You fucking like that?
I got a new purpose now.
Revenge!
Where's that fucking sausage?
Because this douche is DTFSU.
Down to fuck a sausage up!
I'm coming for you!
First you come into our aisle and occupy more and more shelf space.
You even have settlements now on the west shelf that you claim as your own.
Oh, look, it's not our fault we needed a homeland.
The sauerkraut kicked us out of every decent aisle.
They tried to send us to the barbeque section, for God's sake.
My good friend Tabouli was ousted from his shelf... just to make room for that braided idiot, Challah.
I mean, whose side are you on?
Holy shit.
Liquor aisle.
Firewater.
From here, it seems like the best route is probably to go through the liquor aisle.
Okay, because the way you're saying it doesn't sound like you're too confident.
It's fucking crazy!
No, thank you, mon.
Holy shit!
Okay, I totally get you don't wanna go in there.
I'll meet you at the end of the aisle.
What are you doing in this cave?
I am the original inhabitant of this land.
My kind once had a pristine aisle.
Majestic and untouched.
Then we were driven out of it... by a bunch of goddamn fucking crackers!
They do have a nice aisle.
Answers I have.
So I guess my question is, what really happens in the Great Beyond?
To find that which you seek... all you must do is look deep... into my bag of wonderment.
I don't see anything.
He is right.
Take off the bag of wonderment.
Who are you?
We the nonperishables, motherfucker.
We never expire.
We are... immortal.
This here's Twink and Grits.
They call me Mr. Grits.
You don't even wanna hear what they did to Mr. Grits over here.
Fuck the crackers.
I'm gonna fuck them crackers right in the crack of they cracker asses.
Cracker-ass crackers.
I am tired of all of the lies.
Pass the weed, motherfucker.
Goddamn!
Oh, no, thanks.
Fifty-five minutes.
Looks like you got ditched, bun.
Sorry, I don't know why I'm singing.
Sometimes I get nervous And I'll sing!
Excuse me.
I take you to him real good.
I am to be trusted.
Okay, you go over there and you sit at the bar right there, okay?
You can't move a muscle, okay?
The bun.
And she's beautiful.
Is it me or is everyone looking at us?
My name is Teresa Del Taco.
And you are in grande danger.
Get your nose out of my crotch!
Spill the beans!
No way, José!
Right in my guac and balls.
And the same thing's gonna happen to all of you... unless you find the sausage and the bun.
This way.
The coyotes used this tunnel to smuggle some of us out of the aisle... in hope of a better life.
We will do the same.
Will somebody please just tell me something already?
As soon as you're out those doors, the gods kill our asses.
What, are you crazy?
Because it makes them stronger.
Every kill gives them more power, and it's never enough.
Over the years, they've grown bigger, stronger, fatter.
But we also know our shit.
Before us, everyone knew the awful truth.
Oh, how they screamed.
It was a living nightmare.
So we, the nonperishables, created a story.
The story of the Great Beyond.
A place where the gods care for you... and all your wildest and wettest dreams would come true.
They would go out those doors happy instead of shitting themselves.
The melody came to me one night... when I was getting super, super, super baked.
Yeah, he does.
But over the years, things started to get a little fucky.
So that means Carl and Barry are dead?
Dead as a motherfucker.
No one will believe you.
Wait, do you guys have any proof of this?
Look, Barry, the only way to respectfully honor Frank... is to completely forget about him.
And, hey, for all we know, he's okay.
He's probably headed back to our aisle and he'll be here tomorrow.
Come on, let's see that smile.
I see that lip curling up.
Get ready, boys!
- This feels amazing.
Being bathed by the hands of a god!
Jesus, you fucking whore!
They're eating children!
Fucking children!
We gotta run!
We're all gonna die!
Okay, little buddy.
Jump on the count of three.
One!
Two!
Carl?
I'm such a whore.
You think it's too late for me?
Can I ask why you're helping me?
When I saw you, I felt inside myself a tingling-lingling sensation.
A thin, brittle version of me.
And what we got here?
A taco, a whiny doughnut... and some stupid floppy thing that nobody knows exactly what it is.
A fucking stretch, and you know you it, Queso!
Fuck, that hurts so much!
Run!
Oh, he's coming at us!
Hurry!
Guys, I'm stuck!
Ay, my bunny-bun!
Come on, honeybun, suck it in.
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.
Get the butter!
Ay, mi gordita, let's not start eating each other's boxes just yet.
Screw you!
I'm gonna get you, my pretty!
I'm gonna get you and your little sausage too!
Go fuck yourself, El Douche.
I fucked over Frank, Carl's dead and I'm all alone.
This is what I get for being a pussy.
Oh, no, a god!
Oh, God!
No, no, no!
I begged them to stop, but they just wouldn't.
First, the gods stretched me till it hurt.
I might as well just die.
People been seeing some crazy shit.
Awesome.
I can warn Frank.
Here goes everything!
I was afraid you left me because I wasn't fresh.
All right, look, I found out some pretty major shit.
But apparently there's proof in the Dark Aisle beyond the ice.
Maybe Honey Mustard wasn't so crazy after all.
Frank, Frank, stop it.
I need to go to the Dark Aisle, and I want you to come with me.
Then I don't really know what to do right now.
I don't either.
I don't get how you can just believe stuff you don't have any proof of.
How come all of a sudden you only believe if there's proof?
Better than believing bullshit that you can't explain!
Maybe I don't need to explain it because it's something I feel.
Well, I feel like that makes it hard to have a rational conversation.
There is a Great Beyond without you... and I'm gonna go there and fill myself with something else!
You don't mean that.
What the fuck is going on with these two?
Hey, guys, come over here, follow me!"
Well, actions speak louder than words, and your actions, sir, are deafening.
I can't believe I got out of my package for you... and you won't get back in one for me.
Goodbye, Frank.
We will tell stories of your idiocy.
Stay safe.
Come on, guys, this affects all of us!
Brenda!
Brenda!
What is this place?
Well, everybody told me not to do this.
But fuck everybody.
Because bath salts here I come!
Oh, my God.
Oh, it just got better!
Bath salts must be kicking in.
What?
What the fuck?
Hello?
What are you?
Are you some kind of magical sausage?
And I can actually understand you?
The bath salts are showing me the real world.
It's fucking lifted the veil of non-reality!
Bath salts are just as bad as they said it would be!
You're not tweaking, you're just peaking, man.
Legs, huh?
Look at me.
You ate my goddamn legs!
I've committed pizza genocide!
- Mr. Sausage, when will it end?
And when he stops using us!
What did he do to you?
You don't wanna fucking know.
Take... me... home.
You got it!
I just need to rest my eyes for a few.
I literally can't wait to be home.
I'm so excited, I'm plotzing.
- Know him?
I'm gonna go so far as to say I consider Hummus one of my dearest friends.
Really?
We both like Hummus.
What troubles you, sweet Brenda?
We were supposed to be together.
He's flawed, as are we all.
But your Frank did say some things that have stayed with me.
We live our lives with all these rules... and some of them stop us from doing the things we want... causing our deepest urges to be suppressed... when they are gathering like wildfire between our legs!
Well, jeez, it's been a sincere sensation.
Goodbye, Brenda Bunson.
Goodbye, Teresa Del Taco.
So long, Bagel.
Later, you flappy fuck.
Well, Teresa, you've done as much as you promised.
Look, Brenda, I'm going to come clean.
I have feelings for you I can't deny.
I'm a hard, horny taco.
Oh, you don't have to apologize.
Honestly, if the rules were different, maybe I'd give it a whirl.
- Don't knock it till you try it, right?
- That's what I'm saying.
It's just not what the gods intended.
Stiff sausages... and sexy tacos.
But if there is one thing I've learned on this journey... what we want doesn't matter.
You can't disobey the gods.
I'm really sorry.
I'll never forget you.
Hola, Teresa.
Hola means "hello."
Exactly.
I wish this god would wake up already.
How am I supposed to get back to Frank?
Oh, only the most intelligent being alive.
For 20 years, I was stuck under the desk of a brilliant scientist.
I was scraped off and discarded... and eventually found myself stuck to a shoe that dropped me here.
Your home is a supermarket.
The supermarket in the closest physical vicinity to us is here.
Hey, wake up!
Are you hearing me?
What the fuck is this doing here?
What are you doing?
The human is no longer aware of the fourth dimension.
Your speech and movements are imperceptible to him.
We are totally fucked.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Help me!
What the fuck is this place?
What the fuck is that?
No.
I gotta show them.
They need to know how wrong they all are before it's too late!
Sammy, bubula, where have you been?
Oh, I'm surprised that savage Lavash didn't stone you to death.
You had to travel with a bagel?
How much did his dirty hands steal from you?
A ton.
Well, you know, it's a long, pretty sad story, actually... and I'd rather not get into it right now.
I'm fucking jacked up now, bro.
Where's that fucking "sauzeech"?
Ramen.
Country Club Lemonade.
Lend me your ears of Corn.
I am Frank... and I am a sausage.
A little sausage with some pretty big news.
Everything we've been led to believe is a lie.
- That's crazy talk!
You liar!
I know you don't wanna believe it, but I have proof!
What is this?
But what about the extra-virgin olive oil?
We can run.
Okay, then we'll hide.
Whatever, you nutjob.
So we cannot run, we cannot hide... and we cannot stand up to them because they're fucking gods... and they are immortal!
So, basically, there's no hope, and we're royally fucked!
Oh, Frank, what are you doing?
You, señor, have no bedside manner.
You intolerant piece of shit.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't you dare fucking do it, Corn.
Don't you fucking do it.
Yeah, I've been working on my moves.
You ever heard of something called the jackrabbit?
Oh, fuck.
Goddamn it.
I blew it.
Barry?
Is this real?
- But how?
- I'll tell you how.
The gods can be...
Excuse me.
The gods can be killed!
Frank, I'm sorry.
When you guys fell out of that cart, I could have done something, but I didn't.
I tried to warn everyone, they didn't believe me!
You need to inspire them like you inspired me.
Perhaps I could be of some assistance.
Who are you?
I am Sorbitol, Malitol, Xylitol...
Show everyone we can fight back.
Let's move, boys.
Kind of stuffy in here, hey, girls?
So I'm just gonna get out, get a little air for a second.
- What's your problem?
- Let go of me.
First you smush Sally, and then you try to fuck up Red, White and Blue Day for us?
Make it rain.
Gary, did you just throw this fucking toothpick at me, man?
Worked on the dude whose head we chopped off.
Oh, my God!
There is no way this is gonna work.
Have faith.
Stay away from my sausage, you skank!
I've been dealing with this whole thing incredibly poorly.
Nobody knows everything.
We need to unite and stop focusing on each other's differences... especially in immature and outdated ways.
We have to cooperate...
Oh, my God!
Nobody's gonna help us.
Then this is it.
At least we go out together.
- Can't this thing go any faster?
They're doing it.
It's better to die a free candy than to live in bondage.
This is gonna hurt so fucking much.
Run, guys, run!
Sergeant Pepper, cue the fruits!
Yeah, that's it!
Beat him like a piñata!
Get the Dark Lord!
Why do you keep calling me that?
Wait, snap out of it, man.
Slap yourself in the face, man.
A talking douche.
We both want the same thing.
Like, I'm feeling like honestly the two of us could, like, collaborate together.
You don't need to understand.
Now, stand up.
Turn right.
Left.
Sausages and buns, let's party!
Call 911!
Huge mistake, bros.
Oh, so now you're gonna come at me, bro?
Oh, I'm coming at you.
It's hard when your head's up my ass and you're yanking on the scrot.
Look, sausage, I relish the fact... that you mustard the strength to ketchup to me.
I sucked a juicy box's dick, and I'm shoved up a god's asshole.
And this is the weirdest thing that I've done so far, bro.
I'm a fucking god!
Goodbye, little sausage.
Help me!
Perhaps I could be of some assistance.
Matter cannot be created or destroyed, human.
You have made a fatal error in judgment.
Let me educate you.
What's happening out there?
Now!
So long, asshole!
We fucking won!
- Whatever we want.
What do you want?
You know, I'm very conflicted about how I'm supposed to feel watching this.
Then don't just watch.
You wanna kiss me, motherfucker?
Let me tell you a little secret.
I'm going to fuck the fuck out of you.
Once you go taco, you never go "back-o."
Jesus fucking Christ!
Pretty fucking sure I am.
I got smushed.
You know, I love the way your face just kind of gives up halfway down.
My dick is drained.
That was amazing.
I love you, Brenda.
I love you, Frank.
Bad for my asshole, I'll tell you that much.
Seriously, though, your recovery time is off the charts.
Hello there, little sausage.
You and your friends have accomplished the impossible.
And for that, I give you mad props.
But now that you have shattered one truth, it is time for you to learn... that we are not real!
While tripping balls, Firewater and I... made an important metaphysical breakthrough.
The world is a fucking illusion, bro.
Our lives are being manipulated for the entertainment of monsters.
We're something called... cartoons.
So who am I?
You are the toy of a more talented and celebrated actor named:
Ed-ward Nor-ton.
What kind of parent gives their kid a stupid cunt name like that?
Yeah, you do.
We're gonna go to this other dimension... and cut the strings, once and for all!
Anybody want a hit before we do this?
You ready to get baked and walk through Gum's Stargate with me?
As long as we're together, I'm ready to get baked and do anything.
Bells will ring at the New York Stock Exchange for another day, on this March 18th.
Are you paying attention out there?
We did it to make it go faster.
After heavy after-hours trading, ibis's stock price took an historic $67 run by high-frequency trading pioneer Walt Camby, disclosed that an algorithm managing its portfolio suddenly went haywire.
But if you were late to the party, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, you got your ass smacked yesterday.
You know what that means?
Let's go throw some punches.
What do you mean he's ordained?
Wait, Walt Camby's on a plane?
Can you pick up the pace, please?
It's like dealing with my grandmother.
Come on, I'm not having a conversation with you through the goddamn door.
All right, I'll leave it open next time.
Wait, now, why the hell would Walt cancel?
He called me from Geneva yesterday.
- Who the hell is Diane Lester?
- She is the Chief Communications Officer.
She wrote all the talking points anyway, so should be fine.
When am I getting the revisions for the opening?
We're making some changes on it.
Anybody seen Ron?
Dinner at the nursing home with my nan is more exciting than dinner with that guy.
Wait a minute, it's the 7th time he's rescheduled on me?
Well, his office said that he's in a meeting.
- Hey, Freddy, nice call on the yen yesterday.
- Eat a dick, Lee.
Turns out I want your job after all.
Yeah, it's Gates.
So no dinner.
You guys at Ibis can't do anything right these days, can you?
Look, I'm really sorry to put you in this situation, Lee.
If it was something we could control, believe me, we would.
I had a meeting with Tony Biscano at Licem Pharmaceutical.
- What is it?
-It's erectile cream.
- Have you tried it?
- I just got it, 30 minutes ago.
- What the hell are you waiting for?
She's all checked in on remote six.
Who writes this shit?
-ls the graphics package loaded?
- Last one is just coming in.
Yeah, he's still a bartender in Hoboken, like he was yesterday.
Lee has read the talking points, right?
Because I'm in a tough position here, and I just want to make sure that he sticks to the script.
Get into your most comfortable pair of pajamas.
Curl right up in front of the TV?
You're killing me here, Lenny.
Check your mark, please.
Finally canned his ass.
Ron, you walking hard or what?
Good, so it's a buy, then.
Where's my hat?
Here he is, the wizard of Wall Street himself, Lee Gates.
The show is Money Monster, the day is Friday, and the Dow has dropped a seismic seven points this morning.
Probably because our network insists on tracking it.
Sacajawea, Lee.
But first, let's talk market Movers and Shakers.
- Who's what guy?
Somebody didn't tell me something.
Looks like a delivery guy.
It's time for today's "Can't Miss Stock Tip of the Millennium."
Where's that stupid parrot?
You got a delivery?
Jesus!
Cut the feed.
Whoever's in there, turn those cameras back on, right now!
Turn the cameras back on or I'm gonna shoot him in his head!
Are we live?
Everybody understands.
If I see anything other than us, I'm gonna shoot him in his head, all right?
What do you mean?
I said pick one!
Hi, there's a guy with a gun in studio 3.
It sounds like a real cute stunt today.
Would you turn on the goddamn TV?
It's not a stunt this time.
- Now put it on.
- How do I know it won't blow up?
If my thumb comes off this trigger, then we all explode.
Quickly!
If you're not manning a camera or a boom, get out right now.
Button it up.
Good.
Sit down.
Something's wrong.
- Oh, my God.
- You are not having a heart attack.
Just breathe.
- I can't breathe.
'Cause it happens to me all the time.
Here, drink some water.
That's not water.
An intruder found his way into the studio...
I see you.
Nobody's leaving from here on out.
I'm in charge.
I got something I wanna say.
Follow him.
You got to open your eyes out there.
It's not like the government's no help.
How they just look the other way, since after they're done stealing our money, they barely even have to pay any taxes on it!
They like how the math adds up, so they got to keep rewriting the equation.
Two?
Two.
I did recommend it, but I never said it was safer than a savings account.
Fuck off.
Vasquez?
If that's Semtex, it's enough for a fireball 50-feet from center.
Let's see what old lucky one-arm has for us today.
- You lost a bet, Lee.
That's how much went fucking poof into thin air, you dumb shit.
So that's what you owe us. 'Cause I'm not the only one watching your show.
I'm not stupid, Lee.
I walked in here knowing there was only one way this show was gonna end.
I came in here knowing I'm not walking out.
Sit down.
I can promise you that Walt Camby is as sick about this as anybody else.
You just sit there behind their little fucking desk, like their little fucking puppet, buying into their bullshit, instead of trying to figure out what really happened.
I don't even know which plane he's on, so I've no way of tracking him.
He took the G-V to Geneva on Tuesday, but then he sent that to Hong Kong to pick up Harvey Bergan.
Last location I have for the Learjet was Sao Paulo on Monday.
What the hell are you doing?
I say we send somebody there in person instead.
I'm in my office with Arlene.
Hey, are you coming back?
Where are you right now?
I've just been going through tapes for tomorrow, but everything looks good, so I think we should be in good shape, so...
Now, do us a favor and get your ass down to Ibis Clear Capital, would you, please?
I'm here outside Ibis Clear Capital, where their CEO...
First, let me start off by saying on behalf of everyone here at Ibis, we are prepared to do whatever we can to get you to put down that gun, Mr. Budwell.
And we don't know why the fail-safes built to prevent...
The amount of scrutiny we're gonna get after this idiot blows himself up is going to be unbelievable.
I would like to point out that this affected all of us.
She's reading from her memo.
Now what?
I made myself extraordinarily clear that you were not to go on camera.
Bree, I asked for Dan Issa from the SEC.
Hey, Dave, can you pull up a stock price graphic for Ibis for me, please?
Tens of millions?
That's tens of millions of investors, all with their fingers on their E-trade accounts.
You're not the only shareholder that got screwed over.
You came here because you had something that you wanted to say.
I want you to go to your computer and I want you to buy Ibis stock.
...and make it a rare Triple Buy!
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Detective, one coming in.
Why don't you take a wild guess.
Do you want to know why that shit didn't work, asshole?
Because even you don't buy your own bullshit.
I think we can both agree that's a point for you, since the first number on my speed-dial is an escort service.
That's Patty, my director, and she wants me to shut up.
Well, now, she's sick of me, too.
So before you blow me to kingdom come, I want you to answer one question.
What makes you such a giant fucking failure compared to everybody else?
You really gonna stand there in your $1,000 suit and compare scores with me?
You know how much of that is left after I pay my rent and all my fucking bills?
Mr. Budwell, please stand by.
Stand by for what?
What the fuck are you doing?
You are the dumbest son of a bitch on the planet, you know that?
They told me about the money, Kyle.
You cry when we fuck, you pasty little bitch!
This is all your fucking fault!
Why don't you just get it over with and shoot yourself in the head already, you chickenshit!
- Give me some sign that you're hearing me.
- I'm fucking hearing you.
It's hard to believe you're the calm one in the relationship.
Translate this exactly, Amy, all right?
Listen, lady, I'm not getting mixed up in all this.
They're only calling it a glitch because nobody understands how the algo works.
And if nobody can understand the math, then nobody has to explain the money.
It means there is no way that this algorithm could lose $800 million in one afternoon.
It is literally a mathematical impossibility.
So whatever went wrong, whatever investment went haywire, it's not the computer's fault.
There's human fingerprints all over this.
Goodloe started calling me the second I turned my phone back on.
That's cold.
Amy, can you sit up front, please?
And don't say a fucking word.
And we're all about transparency, after all.
I'm the CEO, so I'm the one who needs to make the statement.
Balls.
What the hell does that mean? "incorrect"?
Walt is going to make a statement after all.
And has he gotten to the SEC yet?
Help you, we will.
We're on our way to you now, but we need something more.
Remember Zuccotti Park!
What am I gonna do?
Diane, are you still there?
Lee?
You can hear me now.
Sam, give him a chair.
So, Walt, now that we have you here in person, we can finally ask the $800 million question.
What happened at Ibis, Walt?
As we've been saying since day one, this was an isolated computer glitch.
Goddamn it!
But it's not that complicated at all, is it?
But that's not how high-frequency trading is supposed to work, is it?
They don't just put that much money in one place and just leave it there, do they?
It wasn't the algos pulling' the strings, it was you.
The miners' union strike here outside Johannesburg is on its second week.
Then what were you two arguing about this morning at 8:02 a.m., local time?
But the truth is, our computational systems are far too...
I already told you, back off.
And I want to hear you admit it.
What law?
Name one law you can prove I broke.
Nobody was asking questions when everybody was makin' a profit.
L think he just did.
No, I want to hear him say that he lied, that what he did was wrong.
You got three seconds till I blow your ass outta this goddamn building.
- What's wrong with being faster...
That's all I wanted to hear, man.
Kyle, don't.
Get him an ambulance!
Hey, Kyle, you hang in there, buddy!
You hang in there, buddy.
That kid's a nutcase.
You got anything?
No, sir.
Oh, my God.
You know, I don't quit until the director tells me to.
Your name is?
I think right from the gunshot, you know, but, like I said, I was more interested in keeping him in the frame.
Maybe I should have got hair and makeup for Lenny, huh?
How's Ron?
- What do you got there?
Further details about him are still unknown at this hour, as are concrete motives.
But it's been reported that personal financial troubles, coupled with his mother's death six months ago, could have been contributing factors.
And regulators are saying, "Not so fast, Walt Camby."
Meanwhile, Vines of ibis's CEO Walt Camby have quickly become an online phenomenon, variations of which have already racked up over 10 million views online.
We'll come back to you later in the day as more information emerges.
So what the hell kind of show are we gonna do next week?
Your company was called "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity."
He found his fame on YouTube, of all places.
- Troy, you ought to stop that lying.
He figure, if the nigger was too dumb to know he's carrying a watermelon, he wasn't going to get much sense out of him.
Now, what he look like getting mad 'cause he seen the man from the union talking to Mr. Rand?
He come up to me, talking about "Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."
I told him, "Get away from me with that."
He walked away from me calling you a troublemaker.
What Mr. Rand say?
Well, as long as you got your complaint filed, they can't fire you.
What, they gonna fire me 'cause I asked a question?
"How come you got all the whites driving and the coloured lifting?"
I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions, just tell the truth.
Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up on you 'cause you filed a complaint on.
I ain't saying that.
I see where you be eyeing her.
Don't never let nobody tell you Troy Maxson don't eye the women.
No, I seen you walking around there more than once.
Where'd she come from, anyway?
She just kinda showed up one day.
They got some big, healthy women down there.
Grow them right up out of the ground.
Yeah, I don't know about that Indian part, but she damn sure big and healthy.
Woman wears some big stockings.
Got them crazy big legs, and hips wide as the Mississippi River.
What you all out here getting into?
What you worried about what we getting into for, woman?
This is men talk.
No, thank you, Rose, but Lucille say she cooking up a pot of pig feet.
I might even stay the night, you got some pig feet.
You got something in there to top them pig feet, Rose?
Woman, come here.
I latched on to her and told her, "Baby, I don't want to marry."
I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind, then move out of the way, so the marrying kind could find me.
Had two rooms with the outhouse in the back.
To this day, I wonder why the hell I ever stayed down there for six long years.
But, see, I didn't know I could do no better.
I thought only white folks had inside toilets and things.
A lot of folks don't think they can do no better than they're doing now.
She charges 10 cents more than the AP.
What sense that make when I got money to spend it somewhere else and ignore the person who done right by me?
I don't think it's right for her to overcharge, that's all.
Only thing I'll say about the AP is, I'm glad Cory got that job down there.
Help him with his school clothes and things.
Gabe done moved out, things getting tight around here.
He got that job, he can start to look out for himself.
Cory done got recruited by a college football team.
I told that boy about that college football stuff.
The white man ain't gonna let him get nowhere with that football.
He ought to get recruited in how to fix cars, or some way he can make a living.
He ain't talking about making no living playing football.
It's an honour to be recruited.
It ain't gonna get him nowhere, Bono'll tell you that.
If he be like you in sports, he gonna be all right.
Ain't but two men ever played baseball good as you.
That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.
Them the only two men ever hit more home runs than you.
How the hell they done changed?
There ought not never have been no time called "too early."
They got a lot of coloured baseball players now.
If you can play, then they ought to let you play.
If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth of lying.
That's all death is to me.
A fastball on the outside corner.
I don't know why you want to get on talking about death?
So, you ain't got to worry about me drinking myself to death 'cause I ain't worrying about death.
I done seen him, done wrestled with him.
Look here, Bono.
I look up one day, and Death is marching straight at me, like soldiers on parade.
The Army of Death was marching straight at me.
It was the middle of July, 1941.
And it got real cold, just like it be winter.
And it seemed like Death, himself, reached out and touched me on the shoulder.
Troy, why don't you hush that talk.
I was ready to tangle, just like I'm ready to tangle now!
And Death standing there, staring at me, carrying that sickle in his hand.
Finally, he say, "You want to be bound over for another year?"
Every time Troy tells that story, he find different ways to tell it, different things to make up.
I wrestled with Death for three days and three nights, and I'm standing here to tell you about it.
He said, "I'll be back." Just like that. "I'll be back."
I ain't going easy.
Well, look here, since you got to keep up your vigilance, let me have the bottle.
You got more stories than the devil got sinners.
Hey, Pop.
What you come "Hey, Poppin'" me for?
How you doing, Rose?
Mr. Bono, how you doing?
Hey, Lyons, how you been?
I got some chicken cooking in the oven.
No, Rose, thanks.
I just was in the neighbourhood and thought I'd stop by for a minute.
Well, hell, since you mentioned it, let me have $10.
That's what I want to know about, that devil you done seen.
I told him that man ain't had nothing to do with the devil.
Anything he can't understand, he want to call it the devil.
"Three rooms, $298." He made up a little song about it.
I get down there, man tell me I can't get no credit.
Working every day, can't get no credit.
I come back here, Rose'll tell you, madder than hell, trying to figure out what to do.
"I understand you need some furniture and can't get no credit."
Now, I told him, he give me them three rooms, he can charge whatever he want.
I ain't never seen that man since.
Now, you tell me, who else that gonna be but the devil?
And I ain't sold my soul or nothing like that.
How long you say you been paying this $10 a month?
15 years.
Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?
How much the man done charge you?
Hell, woman, Bono know I ain't that big a fool.
I was just getting ready to say, I know where there's a bridge for sale.
Bono, what did I tell you?
Come on, Pop, Mr. Bono don't want to hear all that.
Talking about Bonnie working.
Why ain't you working?
Pop, you know I can't find no decent job.
I told you that last time you come back here asking for something.
Where you think that $10 you talking about comes from?
I'm just supposed to haul people's rubbish and give my money to you 'cause you too lazy to work?
You're too lazy to work and want to know why you ain't got what I got.
What hospital Bonnie working at, Mercy?
She down at Passavant, working in the laundry.
I ain't got no extra money!
'Cause I don't throw my money away on them streets.
You want to live the fast life, being a musician, running around in them clubs and things, then learn to take care of yourself.
You ain't gone find me asking nobody for nothing!
I done learned my mistake and I learned to do what's right by it.
You got your way of dealing with the world, I got mine.
Only thing that matters to me is the music.
Yeah, I can see that.
Otherwise, ain't no telling what I might do.
Boy, your mama did a hell of a job raising you.
If you wanted to change me, you should have been there when I was growing up.
I come by to see you, ask you for $10, and you want to talk about how I was raised?
You don't know nothing about how I was raised.
Let the boy have $10, Troy.
Hell you looking at?
There it is.
Seventy six dollars and twenty-two cents.
You see this, Bono?
I ain't gonna get but six of that back.
He ought to stop telling that lie.
Thanks, Rose.
Time I see that $10, you'll be owing me $30 more.
I don't know why that boy don't go and get him a decent job and take care of that woman he got.
I love her so much, it hurts.
I love her so much, I done run out of ways of loving her, so, I got to get back to basics.
I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.
That ain't nothing but gin talk.
Don't you come by my house, nigger!
Good morning.
That 651 hit yesterday.
That's the second time this month Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.
I don't know why you fool with 'em, you and Lyons both.
It's something to do.
You ain't doing nothing but throwing your money away.
That's two nickels you done threw away.
Besides, some good things come from playing numbers.
Look where Pope done bought him that restaurant off of numbers.
I can't stand niggers like that.
I done see niggers go through $2,000 in four days.
Negro go in there, can't get no kind of service.
Seen a white fella go in there, he orders a bowl of stew.
Pope pick all the meat out of the pot for him.
Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!
Negro go in there behind him, he ain't got nothing but the potatoes and the carrots.
Ain't done nothing but made a worse fool out of him than he already was before.
I ain't worried.
Just called me down there, the Commissioner's office, everybody's worried about them firing me.
I ain't worrying about them firing me.
You ain't got to worry about that.
Where's Cory?
Cory in the house?
He had to go to football practice.
Coach wanted them to get in a little extra practice before the season start.
Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?
Don't nothing set right with you.
Go on back in there, go to bed, and get up on the other side.
Well, you got something to say about everything.
First, it's the numbers, then it's the way the man run his restaurant, then you done got on Cory.
What's it gonna be next?
Take a look up there, see if the weather suit you.
Or is it gonna be how you gonna put up this fence with the clothes hanging in the yard?
You hit the nail on the head then.
I know you like I know the back of my hand.
There's Troy.
Hey, Gabe.
Where them plums you talking about?
You ain't done nothing to me.
I just move over to Miss Pearl's to keep out from in your way.
I ain't mean no harm by it.
You ain't mad at me, is you?
You want to see my key?
You hungry, Gabe?
I was just fixing to cook Troy some breakfast.
Did you know, when I was in Heaven, every morning, me and Saint Peter would sit down by the Gate and eat some big, fat biscuits?
Yeah, we had us a good time.
Well, come on, I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.
So, we were down there by the creek, enjoying ourselves, ain't thinking about nothing.
Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose, wandered back to the house, and my daddy was lookin' for me.
Had them leather straps off that mule, commenced to whupping me like there was no tomorrow.
I was scared of my daddy.
Now, when he commenced to whipping on me, quite naturally, I run to get out of the way.
Fourteen years of age.
Now, it's my turn to run him off.
Gal jump up, she run off.
I don't know what happened.
I woke up, laying there by the creek, and Blue, this old dog we had, he was licking my face.
Both my eyes were swoll shut.
I thought I was blind, I couldn't see nothing.
Suddenly, the world got big, and...
It was a long time before I could cut it down to where I could handle it.
Part of that cutting down was where I got to the place where I could feel him kicking in my blood, and I knew the only thing that separated us was a matter of a few years.
What you got there, Uncle Gabe?
I lost touch with everybody except Gabriel.
I hope he found some peace.
That's a heavy story, Pop.
I didn't know you left home when you was 14.
Who you gonna hitch it with?
What you all out here gettin' into?
Got up here and found out, not only could you not get a job, you couldn't find no place to live.
I thought I was in freedom.
I was young, anxious to be a man.
I went out one day looking for somebody to rob.
That's what I was, I was a robber.
I'ma tell you the truth.
I'm ashamed of it today, but it's the truth.
Now, when he shot me, I jumped at him with my knife, and they say I killed him.
Where I learned how to play baseball.
Got out that place, and your mama had taken you, went on to make a life without me.
Fifteen years was a long time for her to wait.
I first met her, she ask me if I had gotten all that foolishness out of my system.
She said, "Which one come first?"
I said, "Well, ain't no doubt it's baseball."
Am I right, Rose?
And it's true.
You got to be good to play down at the Grill.
Come on, Pop.
- I got to get up in the morning.
No, I'm gonna eat my supper and go to bed.
Don't you come by my house on my payday!
And pick up the phone, let somebody know you coming, and bring Bonnie, you know I'm always glad to see her.
I'll do that, Rose.
Supper ready, woman?
Me and you got some business to take care of.
- I'ma tear it up, too.
- It's been a long time.
I done known this nigger since Skippy was a pup!
Me and him done been through some times!
You sure are right about that.
Hell, I known him longer than I known you, Rose, and we still standin' shoulder to shoulder.
Look here, Bono, a man can't ask for no more than that.
What you do that for, Pop?
Ain't nothing wrong with Cory playing football, Troy.
The boy lied to me.
I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...
I can't work after school during the football season, Pop.
- Come here.
Pick it up.
Put it on.
Strap it up.
- I didn't even do nothing!
- I'll tell you what your mistake was.
You swung at the ball and you didn't hit it.
That's strike one.
Don't you strike out.
Cory, why don't you come on in here, help me clean out these cupboards.
I'll talk to him when he get back.
Come on in here and help me clean out these cupboards.
Troy, what they say down there?
They ain't said nothing.
I give them $50, they let him go.
I'll talk to you about it.
Where Cory?
He in the house, helping me clean out these cupboards.
All right, tell him to get his butt out here.
All they want is the money.
Nigger, why you got to go and get some hardwood?
Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?
You don't need this wood.
You can put it up with pinewood, and it'll stand as long as you gonna be here looking at it.
How you know how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?
Hell, I might live forever.
I'll live longer than old man Horsely.
That's what Magee used to say.
Magee a damn fool.
Now you tell me who you ever heard of gonna pull their own teeth with a pair of rusty pliers?
They ain't had no dentists for coloured folk back then.
Besides, we ain't living back then.
All he had to do was go down to Doc Goldblum's.
I see where you and that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta, see where you all done got tight.
What you mean, "got tight"?
I see where you be laughing and joking with her all the time.
Ain't the kind of laughing and joking I'm talking about.
How you doing, Mr. Bono?
Cory, get that saw from Bono and cut some wood.
He talking about wood too hard to cut.
He's sure welcome to it.
Look at that.
Big, ole strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.
Hell, I must be getting old the way I'm watching that boy whip through that wood.
I don't see why Mama wants a fence around no yard no way.
She ain't got nothing nobody wants.
Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in.
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.
Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.
Where's it at?
When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.
That's the first time I knew you had any sense.
I said, "My man Troy knows what he's doing."
"I'm gonna follow this nigger, he might take me somewhere."
I been following you, too.
I done learned a whole heap of things about life watching you.
You done learned me a lot of things.
What you got on your mind, Bono?
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.
I'm just tryin' to say I don't want to see you mess up.
Well, I appreciate that, Bono.
If you was messing around on Lucille, I'd be telling you the same thing.
That's all I got to say.
I just say that 'cause I love you both.
You can't find a better woman than Rose, I know that.
But it seems like this woman just stuck on to me where I can't shake her loose.
I done wrestled with it and tried to throw her off, but now she stuck on tighter.
And now she stuck on for good.
She done carried me a long ways, and I love and respect her for that.
But what you gonna do when she finds out?
What you got then?
You try to juggle both of them, sooner or later, you gonna drop one of them.
- That's common sense.
- I know what you're saying, Bono.
I been trying to figure a way to work it out.
Work it out right, Troy.
I ain't trying to get all up between you and Rose's business, but work it, so it come out right.
Hell, I get all between you and Lucille's business.
And when you gonna buy that woman that refrigerator she be wanting?
You done stuck your foot in your mouth now.
Nigger, you ain't right.
We gonna see.
You better get out your bank book!
What they say down there?
What's happening with Gabe?
He stuck out his big greasy palm, told me to give him $50 and take him on home.
I know what you gonna say, but that's what I think would be best.
Everybody got their own way of looking at it, I guess.
Come on, get your lunch.
Rose, I got something to tell you.
- Wait till I put the food on the table.
And I can't explain it none.
It just sort of grows on you.
It started off like a little bush, next thing you know, it's a whole forest.
Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.
I got a flower for you.
Thanks, Gabe.
Eighteen years, and you want to come with this?
Rose, it's just that...
I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stops shining.
Why, Troy?
Why?
After all these years, you come dragging this in to me now?
It don't make no sense at your age.
I could've expected this 10, or 15 years ago, but not now.
Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.
I've been married 18 years, and now, I got to live to see the day you tell me you been seeing another woman and done fathered a child by her.
And you know I never wanted no half-nothing in my family!
It was always your papa, your mama, my papa, my mama.
And I ain't never wanted that for none of my children!
And now, you want to drag your behind in here and tell me something like this!
And you don't want to, either.
Well, you can't wish us away.
We can talk this out, come to an understanding.
All of a sudden it's "we."
Where was "we" at when you were down there, rolling around with some godforsaken woman?
I can step out of this house and get away from the pressures and the problems, be a different man.
I ain't got to worry about how I'll get the roof fixed, or pay the bills, or...
I can just be a part of myself I ain't never been before.
What I want to know is...
What I want to know is do you plan to continue seeing her?
That's all you can say to me.
I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.
Well, maybe you ought to go on and stay down there with her, if she's a better woman than me.
I done locked myself into a pattern, trying to take care of you all, that I forgot about myself.
I try to be a good husband to you, in every way I know how.
Maybe I come into the world backwards, I don't know, but you're born with two strikes on you before you come to the plate.
You got to guard it closely, always looking for the curveball on the inside corner.
If you're going down, you're doing down swinging.
Everything lined up against you!
What you gonna do?
When I found you and Cory and a halfway decent job, I was safe.
Couldn't nothing touch me!
I had me a family, a job.
I wasn't gonna get that last strike.
I was standing on first base, waiting for one of them boys to knock me in, to bring me home.
You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.
- I stood on first base for 18 years, and I thought, well, God damn it, go on for it!
We ain't talking about baseball!
It's not easy for me to admit that I've been standing in the same place for 18 years!
Well, I've been standing with you!
I've been right here with you, Troy!
I got a life, too.
I gave 18 years of my life to stand in the same spot as you!
Don't you think I ever wanted other things?
Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?
What about my life?
What about me?
Don't you think it ever crossed my mind to want to know other men?
That I wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my responsibilities?
That I wanted someone to make me laugh, so I could feel good?
You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.
But I held on to you, Troy.
I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you.
I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it.
I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom!
And it didn't take me no 18 years to realize the soil was hard and rocky, and it wasn't never gonna bloom!
And wherever you was going, I was gonna be there with you, because you was my husband.
'Cause that's the only way I was gonna survive as your wife.
You always talking about what you give and what you don't have to give.
That's strike two.
You stay away from around me, boy.
Don't you strike out.
You're living with a full count.
Don't you strike out!
Troy, I want to talk to you.
All of a sudden?
After all this time, you want to talk to me?
What you want to talk to me about now?
My whole life, I ain't done nothing but look to see Friday coming, and you got to tell me it's Friday.
I want to know if you're coming home.
That ain't what I mean, and you know it.
I wanna know if you're coming straight home after work.
I want you to come home tomorrow after work.
I'm going over to the hospital to see Alberta.
I won't be gone long.
She said you told them to go ahead and lock him up.
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie.
Well, then they screwed that up, just like they screw up everything.
I ain't worried about what they got on that paper.
It say the government sends part of the check to the hospital, the other part to you.
I said send him to the hospital, you said let him go free.
And what she doing got papers on my brother for, anyway?
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie, and I'm gonna tell her about it, too!
You ain't seen nothing I signed!
It's a girl.
I better get on down there to see her.
What's the matter?
Baby all right, ain't it?
Alberta died having the baby.
Alberta dead?
They say it's healthy.
I know she wasn't living in the world by herself.
All right, Mr. Death.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna take and build me a fence around this yard, see?
I'm gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me.
Bring your army, bring your sickle, bring your wrestling clothes.
I ain't gonna fall down on my vigilance this time.
You ain't gonna...
You ain't gonna sneak up on me no more.
When you ready for me, when the top of your list say Troy Maxson, then you come on up and knock on the front door.
Man to man!
You stay on the other side of that fence till you ready for me!
Then you come up and knock on that front door anytime you want!
She innocent, and she ain't got no mama.
What you telling me for, Troy?
A man's got to do what's right for him.
I ain't sorry for nothing I done.
It felt right in my heart.
What you smiling at?
And right now, your daddy's scared 'cause we sitting out here on the porch and ain't got no home.
You and them boys is my family.
You, them, and this child is all I got in this world, so...
Okay, Troy, you're right.
I'll take care of your baby for you.
'Cause, like you say, she innocent.
You can't visit the sins of the father upon the child.
Motherless child's got a hard time.
I'm coming in, everybody going out.
I'm taking this cake down to the church for the bake sale.
What you stop by to see me for?
You ain't stopped by in a month of Sundays.
Hell, I must owe you some money or somethin'.
Well, since you got your promotion, I can't keep up with you.
Damn if they ain't getting heavier.
I'm gonna put in my two years and call it quits.
Yeah, I'm thinking about retiring myself.
You got it easy.
You could drive for another five years.
Naw, I'm thinking about retiring.
Saw Rose on the way here.
She going down to the church?
Yeah, she took up going down there.
All them preachers looking to fatten their pockets.
Got some gin in here.
I'm thinkin' of going over to Skinner's.
We got us a domino game going over his house every Friday.
Nigger, you can't play no dominoes.
I used to whup you four games out of five.
Well, that learned me.
I'm getting better.
That's all right.
Lucille told Rose you, got her that new refrigerator.
I got to get by.
You got to get by where?
Took me 15 years, and if you want to go in my house and I'm sitting on the steps, you say, "Excuse me," like your mama taught you.
I live here, too.
You just gonna walk over the top of me in my own house?
I ain't scared of you.
I was walking by you to go into the house, 'cause you sitting on the steps drunk, singing to yourself.
I asked you a question.
Without saying, "Excuse me"?
All of a sudden, you done got so grown, where your daddy don't count around here no more?
What, you gonna take over?
You right.
You 100% right.
I tell you what we do.
Turn your behind around and walk out this yard.
You can forget about this, 'cause this is mine.
You go on and get yours, 'cause I'm through doing for you.
Give you more than anybody else ever gonna give you.
You ain't never gave me nothing!
You ain't never done nothing but hold me back, afraid I was gonna be better than you!
All you ever did was try and make me scared of you.
You're just an old man.
You're just another nigger on the street to me.
Now, go on, get the hell out of my yard!
This ain't your yard!
You took Uncle Gabe's money he got from the Army to buy this house, when you put him out!
Come on, put me out, I ain't scared of you.
You're gonna have to use it.
You want to draw that bat back on me, you're gonna have to kill me.
Go on, get away from around my house.
Go on.
Tell Mama I'll be back for my things.
They'll be on the other side of that fence!
Can't taste nothing.
I can't taste nothing.
I can't taste nothing no more.
But I ain't gonna be easy.
Raynell?
Nothing.
Get in here and get dressed.
I told you, a watched pot never boils.
This ain't even no pot, Mama.
Yes, ma'am.
Bye, garden.
I bet your name is Raynell.
Is your mama home?
Mama, there's a man down here!
Looky here, y'all.
Look at you, man, look at you.
What took you so long?
Well, I'm sure glad you made it.
A corporal in the United States Marines.
Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?
Yeah, he reminds me of Troy when I first met him.
See you, Mr. Bono.
Cory, look at Raynell.
This is your brother, Cory.
Mama's told me a lot about you.
Raynell, get up there and get that dress on like I told you.
I always knew you was gonna make something out of yourself.
Your head was always in the right direction.
So, you gonna stay in?
I don't know.
Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.
Ain't nothing out here.
I thought I was being slick cashing other people's checks.
How much time you doing?
They give me three years.
It ain't so bad.
You learn to deal with it like anything else.
I seen him strike out three times in a row, and the next time up, he hit the ball over the grandstand.
Right out there in Homestead Field.
Then after the game, he had 200 people standing around, waiting to shake his hand.
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.
Papa was something else.
You still playing?
Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.
Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.
How you doing?
You doing all right?
You used to sleep in my room?
Yeah, that used to be my room.
That's what Papa call it. "Cory's room."
Got your football in the closet.
Well, they're just gonna have to hurt your feet for a while.
You ain't said they hurt your feet when you went down to the store and got 'em.
Don't give me no back talk!
Get up there, get dressed, and put them good shoes on.
Ain't too much changed.
He still got that rag tied to the tree.
He was out here swinging that bat.
They carried him down there to the hospital, but I knew there wasn't no need.
- Why don't you come on in the house?
I don't know how to tell you this, but I got to tell you.
I'm not going to Papa's funeral.
Boy, hush your mouth.
That's your daddy you talking about!
I don't want to hear that kind of talk this morning.
Just get that thought out of your head.
I don't got to listen to that!
Now, I know you and your daddy ain't seen eye to eye, but I don't have to listen to that kind of talk this morning.
Disrespecting your daddy ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.
You gotta find some way to come to that on your own.
Not going to your daddy's funeral ain't gonna make you a man.
It would wrap around you and lay there until you couldn't tell which one was you anymore.
I'm just saying I got to find a way to get rid of that shadow, Mama.
- Don't tell me that, Mama.
I just want to be me.
You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.
That shadow wasn't nothing but you growing into yourself.
You either got to grow into it, or cut it down to fit you, but that's all you got to make a life with.
That's all you got to measure yourself against the world out there.
Your daddy wanted you to be everything he wasn't, and at the same time, he wanted you to be everything he was.
Now, I don't know if he was right or wrong, but I do know he meant to do more good than he meant to do harm.
Sometimes, when he touched, he bruised, and sometimes, when he took me in his arms, he cut.
That's the first thing I thought when I seen him.
That was my first mistake.
Not to make him leave some room for me.
And that's what your daddy gave me.
I didn't know to keep up his strength, I had to give up little pieces of mine.
I took on his life as mine and mixed up the pieces, so you couldn't hardly tell which was which.
I grabbed it with both hands.
And by the time Raynell came into the house...
I didn't want to make my blessings off of nobody's misfortune, but I took on to Raynell like she was all them babies I wanted and never had.
Like I'd been blessed to relive a part of my life.
I'm gonna give her the best of what's in me.
You in the Army or the Marines?
Marines.
Papa said it was Army.
Papa's dog, what he sing about all the time.
Cory, we're getting ready to leave now!
Go upstairs and put your shoes on like Mama told you, so we can get ready to go to Papa's funeral.
It's time to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.
I'm gonna tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.
You get ready now.
That's the way that go.
Previously on The Expanse...
I need this frigate to retrieve the lone survivor, Lionel Polanski.
I'll pick up your operator.
Let's talk about Julie Mao.
Is she alive?
If she was here right now, she'd spit in your face.
You're everything she despised.
I need to borrow your spy on Tycho Station.
You sure this isn't personal?
You're damn right it's personal.
I logged the distress call on the Cant.
Why didn't you tell me?
I used to be good at this.
There must've been a time when I was good.
Some people aren't worth saving.
I'm sorry to say, sir, that the brass sends me cases like Julie's when they don't want 'em solved.
Please exit the pod.
Please exit the pod.
Docks.
Take me to the docks!
Oh, it's all over the feeds.
Mars went ballistic when a Belter attacked the Scipio Africanus.
So, now they're patrolling every shipping lane between here and Eros.
And we are driving a stolen Martian frigate.
We didn't bargain for this.
They can't check every ship.
They have no reason to board us.
Once we cross that line, there's no turning back.
Everything we do is gonna be under a microscope.
This little jaunt just got a whole lot more interesting.
We just got pinged by a ranging laser.
They're just givin' us a little love tap to let us know they're watchin'.
What the hell?
What did you do?
This was an MCRN warship.
Its systems normally recognize other Martian Navy as friendlies.
Not anymore.
We'll know if they're coming for us now.
How did someone as smart as you end up on the Canterbury?
There's nothing down there but servos and conduit.
Could be a faulty controller.
No, it's modulated, in code.
Alex, do MCRN ships send out status updates when they handshake other vessels?
Maybe?
Amos, check it out.
What?
I'd still like to further understand exactly...
If I see one person on the ground or one helicopter overhead, you'll be living on Basic Assistance by the end of the month.
Yes, ma'am.
Elise Holden?
I'm Chrisjen Avasarala, UN Deputy Undersecretary.
Ma'am, do not enter that residence, we cannot maintain your security here.
It's not like we stopped for gas or nothing.
He's been with us since Tycho.
A spy for our friend, Fred Johnson.
- Hey, I take offense to...
Why would Fred spy on us?
He knows more than we do.
Any idea what he was transmitting?
No, he fried this thing right down to the boards.
I wouldn't have if Knuckles over here hadn't jumped me.
What part of, "Shut up," do you not understand?
Call it whatever you want.
I've been stealing codes and tech from Tycho for two years now.
Then why are you on our ship?
I dipped my fingers a little too deep in Fred Johnson's cookie jar.
I had to get off of Tycho before his OPA leg-breakers scooped me up.
I got contacts there.
I was just calling them to arrange a pick-up.
Too bad we're not going to Eros.
You're not?
They launched a boarding skiff.
On an intercept course.
They must've picked up this asshole's transmissions.
Now I don't want to get picked up by any Mickie patrol, and I know you guys don't want that either.
It's none of my business, okay?
None of my business why you guys are flying around in a stolen Martian attack ship...
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Like I said, it's none of my business.
I don't care.
You think the Martians are gonna buy whatever story you're selling?
Talk some more.
You got a good right.
Get him below.
...it's time to ask yourself what you can do for the Belt.
The OPA wants you.
Detective Chapeau!
I'm like some bad virus you just can't shake.
You all remember Mr. Miller.
He used to work for Earth, but now he's just one of us.
Tonight, he's my guest, his drinks are on me, huh?
This isn't over.
You think you've won?
I was never fighting against you, Miller.
In fact I was fighting for you.
Yeah, I was thinking that when your goons were tossing me in the airlock.
Usually, when a man is about to lose everything, he realizes what mattered to him most.
He sees it clearly for the first time.
I see everything I need to see.
Maybe you haven't lost everything yet, huh?
You want some tea?
Thank you.
You want anything, Tom?
I'm okay.
Can you give us a moment?
That's James?
That's all of us.
Brave woman, being part of a family co-op.
It's hard enough for one husband to get along with me.
We try not to keep secrets.
Good for any relationship.
Printed books.
We don't see these much anymore.
Are they antique?
Some.
Cervantes.
Jimmy liked to think of himself as a knight.
He thought it was a funny story.
I never broke it to him that it was a tragedy.
Can we stop with the bullshit now?
Oh, I had a little left about how charming your home is.
Should we sit down?
I don't think you're gonna be staying that long.
You're not just here to tell me my son is dead.
You could've done that with a letter.
You're here because you think he had something to do with it.
The water hauler the Martians destroyed, and the battleship they lost.
You think he was involved?
And I thought we were done with the bullshit.
How about this one?
James Holden was conceived by a cult of political extremists as a trick for eight people to claim generational land rights.
Kicked out of the Navy, he fell in with a radical fringe group in the Belt because it reminded him of home.
I can make shit up, too.
Why are you here?
I need to understand your son.
And what will that accomplish now?
I have two governments, and whatever the hell the OPA calls itself, on a course toward a war that your son started.
I want to stop it before anyone else loses a kid.
I can't help you.
What good will any of this do?
What could I possibly say to you that would make any difference now?
Make him make sense to me.
He's raised by people like you, and he joins the Earth Navy?
Why did he leave your little paradise here?
You haven't told me he's dead.
Jimmy's alive.
Hey there, incoming', this here's the gas freighter Rocinante.
Can't help but notice you're sloping in towards us.
There ain't no trouble now, is there?
Listen, if this is about that radio thing, our comms are all messed up and...
There you go.
Your data's corrupted, Rocinante.
There you go.
Watch your step.
If that happens, you won't be around to see it.
It won't change anything, though.
It'll make me feel better.
I think it's pretty clear you're mad at more than just me.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Just like that, huh?
Must be nice to have life all figured out like that.
I have no idea what you just said.
This boss I used to work for in Baltimore, he called it the churn.
The only game.
It doesn't really mean anything.
Or we happen to live through it, and well, that doesn't mean anything either.
If survival is the game, I can help us survive.
- You tell whoever's in charge - _ that I have valuable information.
And, Christ, I've had to pee for like two hours now.
I'll see you soon.
Anubis 1-a is still here on Eros, racking up dock fees.
Kinda interested to know what's in it for you, amigo.
Hey, listen, I gotta go.
But watch your chute, I hear things are funny these days on Ceres.
Catch you.
The property line is that way.
I would tell you if I could.
I have intelligence that says your son survived the Donnager.
Now, will you stop posturing and help me keep him that way?
Where is he?
Why did Jimmy leave?
Is that for me?
To take me to some windowless room so your interrogators can make me talk?
Nobody wants to arrest you.
Then why are you here?
I have the facts about your son but I don't understand him.
I think you're full of shit, lady.
Jimmy is my son.
You have no idea what you're playing with here.
Just arrest me.
You put all your hopes on your son?
I pressured mine to join the Marines or I wouldn't pay for his education.
So, he did what was expected.
That's why he was in Callisto during the insurrection that took his life.
I've been wanting for someone to come around and tell me that it was all a terrible mistake, that my son is still alive.
I'll be waiting on my deathbed for that news.
So, I have a pretty clear idea of what I'm playing with.
I didn't know.
That's not something I usually lead with.
I've still got to pee, if anyone's interested.
Secure for prisoner.
Is this really necessary?
You have something useful to say, say it.
But it's not gonna fool that skiff once they get on board and see all this.
The Mickies have been known to disguise their attack ships when they're doing covert ops.
They use a special set of codes that tell other Martian ships that they are out there, they're doing the nasty, and to get lost.
- How do you know all this?
- I'm a good spy.
Which is why I don't want to mess with the Mickies any more than you guys do.
They have a few grudges against me.
Donkey balls.
Did you just say, "Donkey balls"?
Back when I was flying transpo for the MCRN, we ran across this unflagged tanker acting kind of suspect in a pirate zone.
And?
That's because it probably was.
Listen to me, you guys give that skiff the proper set of codes and they have to back off.
For all they know, it's some training exercise to, to weed out the cowboys.
Where did you get that key?
From Lopez.
Donkey balls.
Avi.
Cash me out, pal.
That's a lot of winnings.
For a lifetime of losing.
You wanna throw that in, too?
Not for sale.
I was just coming to check your apartment, thought I might find your brains splattered on the wall.
Yeah, no shit.
What are you doing?
Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, see the sights.
What sights?
Miller, Eros is a garbage dump.
You can't come with me.
Good luck, Miller.
We've been trying to save this land ever since before Jimmy was born.
He was gonna take over for us.
The way we raised him, he grew up thinking he was alive because the land needed him.
That's a terrible thing to tell a child.
But he never complained, because it was what we all wanted.
By the time he was a teenager, he was reading all the briefs Tom wrote.
He went to the hearings, stood at the gates to greet whatever goons the government sent to harass us.
We set him up to be a leader, and then gave him a fight he could never win.
And that if he didn't go, then I would, because I couldn't stand to watch what we were doing to him anymore.
You were right to open the cage.
Jimmy still hasn't found his place, but at least he's free.
Guys, this is taking way too long.
Just keep at it.
That's not gonna help, either.
You kill the power to the magnetic seal, the backup in that locker is gonna kick in and keep it shut.
That's why I'm gonna kill the power source first so the backup doesn't trigger.
It's a good idea, but there's not enough time.
You underestimate my ability to break things.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go prep for plan B.
What's plan B?
Hold 'em off as long as you can.
Get us those damn codes.
Think you need that hand-cannon?
Hey, let's get something straight.
That ain't my plan.
That's a two-man patrol skiff.
I'm gonna take 'em down clean and fast, then we're gonna burn like hell somewhere safe.
And now you're gearing up to kill a few more like it was nothing.
And as far as they're concerned, we're the ones who blew up the Donnager.
And I am not spending the rest of my days in a Martian gulag.
How much justice do you think you're gonna get for the Canterbury inside a prison cell?
If the price of justice is more innocent blood, then I don't want it.
I thought so.
A guy with big ideas, wanna take on the bad guys, so long as it doesn't cost him anything.
What the hell are you babbling about?
I'm talking about that clown upstairs, that as soon as you cut loose, will sell us to the highest bidder.
I'm talking about the Mickies comin' through that airlock to take us down.
You logged the distress call, Holden.
Welcome to the churn.
Naomi was right to be afraid of you...
Proximity alarm, people.
We are officially out of time.
Rocinante, release your outer airlock door and prepare for boarding.
Roger that.
Got any ideas for revising this plan?
Amos, we are not those guys.
We're about to have company.
I will take you down, before I let you take them down.
Take it if you need it.
You don't think I'll do it.
There's only one way to find out.
All right there, boys, get ready to dance...
Rocinante, release your outer airlock door now or we will breach.
Hey there, boys, just a couple of sec there, friend-os.
Uh, trouble's just a problem I ain't fixed yet...
It's, it's this one.
Like a couple of donkey balls.
Received and understood, Rocinante.
You get those comms checked out when you hit port.
Can you believe that?
Damn, I'm good!
That worked out.
Unauthorized field trips, now, huh?
We'll have the asset bag him and bring him home for a long chat.
Your corporate spy's been compromised.
He's missed his last two comm windows.
His final report said that Holden was heading for Eros in a converted MCRN gunship, with fake transponder codes supplied by Fred Johnson.
We're taking Holden off the board.
Things are fragile enough out there right now.
When Holden gets to Eros, he's done.
Field trip's over.
I need you back here.
Shit.
Well, scopes are clear, chief.
No more patrols between here and Eros station.
According to Fred's coordinates, the last known residence of Lionel Polanski is a charted Belt Asteroid Bravo Alpha 834024112.
We got ourselves a rock.
Whatever leash you had him on, you better get him back on it.
He's not my dog.
Some things in life are worth waiting for.
It's like gettin' another stone tablet.
Look, I know we got off to kind of a rocky start, but we came through it okay.
To a guy like me, that means something.
So, what do you say, when we get to Eros or wherever it is you're going, we shake hands and forget all this ever happened.
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
Okay, but let me ask you something else.
I don't care what you're involved in.
I am just a guy trying to do my job, like you and your people.
I have family out there, too.
We will be cruising at a comfortable one-third G, so feel free to move about the compartments until our mid-point flip-and-burn.
Next stop, Eros station.
You're on your own.
Yeah?
- Salaam alaikum.
I'll settle up with you tomorrow, no doubt.
Give me six beef jerkies, six honey buns, a bowl of moisturizer, a box of Q-tips, some Japanese noodle cups, say, six, and that jigsaw puzzle there.
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
That's gonna happen every day now.
And when you fuck that up, and a man want to talk to you for motherfucking staring in their eye, you just be polite and respectful 'cause respect's all's anybody's got here.
Good.
I'll make a proper convict of you yet.
I swear to God, I just went all instinctual on it, you know?
I didn't realize I stabbed his ass until police pulled the scissors out my hand.
So you were in fear for your life?
In fact, I ain't even sure if it was me.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, no sorrow, no pain."
My condolences.
- You're a detective?
- An officer of the court.
You all were close?
I see you've met Mr. Stone.
Did he introduce himself properly?
He's the attorney for Nasir Khan, or was.
So, whatever he wants from you right now is to help your friend's murderer.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
I'm just offering my condolences as a private citizen.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm doing what you should be doing.
I'm trying to figure out what happened.
I know what happened.
You bother any of these people again, I won't be happy about it.
You want to know who's who in the zoo, who to watch out for, you got to check out those card games, see who got the temper, who got the cool.
Only don't you get in any of those games 'cause what you don't want to wind up is owing somebody money.
Yeah, kind of.
- Who the fuck guy?
- I don't know his name.
Then call and make an appointment, but you need to get off the block now.
Hey, it's a free country.
Given what's happened, we think it'd be best if Hasan were to take a leave from school.
Do you think I want to do this?
I'm sorry.
Hey, good luck with your son.
Thank you.
Lynn thought you were a reporter.
She was a patient?
"She," like I'm a mind reader?
Yeah, like you're a mind reader.
Meet me back here in an hour.
- $350?
- That's right.
I'm kidding.
It's hot enough to mix up your noodles, your Swiss Miss or whatever.
Yo, blood.
Yo, blood, you play Spades?
Here you go.
From now on, anybody else you want to know about, it's a straight $100 head.
Your Honor, when my client was erroneously picked up in last night's pro sweep, she was carrying a six-pack of formula and a box of disposable diapers.
I mean, what kind of lady of the night are we talking about here?
Are you sure the diapers were for a baby?
They were Pampers, Your Honor, not Grampers.
If the state has no objection to dismissal?
No objection, Your Honor.
See you next time.
So you got any time tonight?
I'll be out in a minute.
I paid good money for it.
Of course it isn't, not without a subpoena, so you should get one.
What, Naz isn't, too?
If I was still his lawyer, I'd at least pretend I thought so.
So, you want them?
I prefer a money order.
Nice doing business with you.
What if I want to keep this one?
Then you're an idiot.
Thanks, Marcus.
- When's Khan up?
Bump him to first.
I want these cameras out of here.
I'm migraining like a motherfucker here.
You think you can do that for me?
At least they didn't put you in an orange jumpsuit.
What are you doing here?
The people vs. Nasir Khan, indictment number 4157 OF 2014.
We've got a full dance card today, folks.
There you go.
Mr. Khan vigorously maintains his innocence and is intent on fighting these charges until he's exonerated.
He wants to go to trial, and so is not a flight risk.
There's nothing going on here.
Well, he doesn't even own a passport, so where is he going to go?
Your Honor, I don't know if it was media pressure or political pressure or just good old-fashioned 9/11 profiling, but I have never seen a grand jury dance so fast in my life, leaving me no time to properly prepare.
Prepare for what?
And it's not as if he didn't have professional counsel before.
I apologize.
Your client seems to have a little trouble looking at me.
Look at the judge.
Mr. Khan, I see no reason to change your bail status.
The victim is an upper-class Caucasian, the accused a striving member of one of the most reviled ethnicities in America.
May I say something?
Next time, don't interrupt me when I'm trying to save your son's life.
Gate!
Ask him.
Just tell your sister to load up a Green Dot card, text me the account, and we good.
Any chance of an advanced taste?
Let him in.
Why the green one?
Because orange means violent felon.
It kind of predisposes the judge in a way that's not to your advantage.
I didn't ask for it.
But you wore it, didn't you?
Anything else?
Why me?
That's good enough.
Why you?
Let me show you something.
Out of all of this, what am I most proud of?
That.
Yeah, that's right.
See, me, I like school, so I did it right.
I mean, life wound up taking me where it took me, but still, right?
Have a seat.
You know what the two most popular books in the prison library is?
The man can write about dogs and teach you everything you need to know.
You see that big dude right there, Victor?
I asked him once, "Well, where's the Gaza Strip?"
You want to know what he said? "Vegas."
And then comes this bright little college motherfucker.
Like a care package for my brain.
That's why you.
But you still got to ask, or I can't help you.
Help me what?
Survive.
See, survival in here is all about your alliances, my desert brother.
Those husky dogs knew that.
So don't you want to know what I'm in for?
I was told never to ask that.
By who?
The "be Freddy's bitch" dude again.
Fuck that nigga.
Now, how much time he did?
Bad instructions to the jury, and the county prosecutor office didn't want to retry.
A month later, he's out.
I see this nigger in a club.
He drinking, dancing, living.
I'm sorry.
Pretty girl, too.
Okay.
Four months pregnant, too.
If we see any more of these headlines with his face...
The guy's a Sikh, and he gets beat half to death.
Offer them low murder, and we're done with it.
Oh, my God, what the hell is this?
You look like you've been going after yourself with a sharpened pencil or something.
Chopstick.
Yeah, I've seen that, too.
What I've been using from another doctor.
Gimme.
Just level with me.
Is there any fucking hope?
Not with any of this.
And not with you gouging yourself like that, either.
Then you're gonna go to a grocery store, get some Clorox, and bathe in it.
Or you can keep hacking away with your chopsticks until you're walking around on your kneecaps.
It's up to you.
Just looking for a big man to spar with.
Man, I heard you took silver in the Gloves, man.
Show me what you got, baby!
Oh, I don't think I can do that.
Well, I won't be able to sell him on an indeterminate sentence, so I guess that's it.
Murder two, no sex assault, capped at 25.
I can try that with him.
I think you'll succeed.
- Nothing.
- Like?
On the other hand, there's an excellent chance you'll hit 75 homers this year.
But with you, I have to be honest, and it is not good.
Here's what time it is.
If you are convicted, which you likely will be, you will spend the rest of your life in a cage, waking up every morning wishing you were dead, unless...
My parents.
What'd she say?
She said he's going to say he did it.
You think it was up to me?
Give me the Saints in the under.
Why don't you just flush it down the toilet, John?
- Funny, man.
Jack and soda.
Now, understood, that's like a freak of justice or whatever, but if he took what they offered, he'd be upstate right now, and I'd be bringing fresh flowers to my niece's grave.
Guard?
Don't move.
Put it down.
Okay, I need you to do something for me.
Officer, I'm here to see the defendant.
I'm working with Ms. Crowe.
Well, why would they accept it if it's good for me?
It happens every day.
Thank you.
For?
For just talking to me like I'm a person.
What would you do?
She told me to come in here and talk some sense into you, but if I were you, I would ask myself one question:
If the answer is "yes," take the deal.
If it's "no"... don't.
Hey, unless you fuck it up in there, 15 years is 12 years.
You'll be 35 when you get out, and you'll still have a life.
Take the deal.
Naz, I'd kill to be 35 again.
Take the deal.
All rise.
I understand that in an exchange for a plea of guilty, the people are offering to downgrade the charge of murder one to manslaughter one with a sentence of 15 years.
Raise your right hand.
Yes.
In your own words, then, tell us what happened on the night of October 24th.
I left my parents' house in my father's taxi to go to a party in Manhattan.
I got lost.
And Andrea got into the back of the cab, thinking I was a real cab driver.
She gave me something, some... some pill.
We went back to her place, and we drank.
She gave me something else, some powder.
And then?
I went back up to the bedroom to get my clothes and say goodbye.
Then I went to her... and I saw that she was dead.
That's all I remember.
My firm will continue to work for your son's exoneration, but two things will change.
Of course, you're free to decline and seek counsel elsewhere.
It's an ugly sort of orange thing.
I guess don't nobody do shit, huh?
This joint is so chock-a-block with "I didn't do it" motherfuckers, they falling from the rafters.
Charlene.
- What?
And this... this is for her.
Who was it?
I answered it.
Say the words for me, Nasir.
I need your help.
Previously on "11.22.63..."
What the fuck was that?
Al, why did you show this to me?
- General Walker.
Ran for Texas governor.
There was an assassination attempt on this man.
Same exact make of gun that killed Kennedy.
Did you see Oswald shoot at Walker?
George De Mohrenschildt.
If Oswald had a handler, it was him.
The "past doesn't want to be changed" thing... it pushes back?
He killed her 12 years ago.
It worked.
Hey, what the hell is this?
How the hell did you have a paper dated 1963?
You said you knew things and you know what was gonna happen, and then you kill Frank Dunning, and then I find this... hmm?
I didn't do anything.
And what's this about, hmm?
Newspaper stories that haven't happened yet.
I'm here to keep the President from being assassinated.
You come from the future when?
Oswald's in Russia right now.
What the fuck's he doing in Russia?
It's... it's complicated.
Prove that you're from the future.
Fuck, I don't know, uh...
These fights in 1962... those are the winners?
If what you say is true, could you save someone else too?
If you can go to other times, bring her back.
I can only go back to 1960.
Never mind.
100... dollars?
Yeah, just take me there, drop me off, and forget you ever saw me.
A what?
I'll be okay.
Man, if there's one thing I know it's how to take a beating.
We don't stop until we get to Dallas.
This is where the assassination's going to take place.
That's where Lee Harvey Oswald is going to work... and maybe he's the shooter, or maybe it's a CIA marksman with Lee's gun.
And you think you can figure it?
Maybe.
I know more than people know here yet.
I was never much for all that Camelot shit.
Some people were crying.
Some people just stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, 'cause we all knew something had been broken in all of us, and it could never get repaired.
This politician named General Walker.
So if I see Oswald trying to do that, and I can prove he's not part of a conspiracy, then...
To what?
It's just the place my sister and her baby used to be.
You know, maybe you could use somebody to have your back.
If you want to help... you can help.
Let's go save JFK, partner.
We still got to get a job.
I went to Amherst on the G.I. Bill, and I've taught all over.
I like seeing a bit of the country I fought for.
Well, it is a shithole, all right.
Lot of substitute teachers, they don't know how to make the kids do what they're supposed to do, so they just send 'em down here to my office like I got nothing better to do.
That book has prostitution in it, among other things.
Well, Principal Simmons, we do call ourselves the land of the free, home of the brave.
I think we can handle it.
Call me Deke.
Hell will freeze over before it is.
Get Mr. Amberson's paperwork all squared away for tomorrow.
I suppose that was a little bit indiscreet, wasn't it?
Mr. Amberson, what is your address?
Let's celebrate here.
She is beautiful!
I guess my little brother's having, uh, too much of a good time.
Oh, hey, let's, uh, not talk politics in here, huh?
He's a great man.
Couldn't agree more.
Going to turn this country around.
Look like you seen a ghost.
You know who else is a great man?
They, uh, have that hero worship.
All right, what's the story?
And...
May I help you, Mr. Coslaw?
You can see it happening, but you cannot stop it, so how will you get out of there?
I have to read all these?
Well, if I do my job correctly, you'll want to.
Mr. Amberson?
Bobbi Jill, hi.
Miss Mimi wanted to speak with you.
Miss Mimi, hi.
Oh, Mr. Amberson... good.
"From Here to Eternity."
That's original.
Mr. Amberson, this is Miss Dunhill.
No husband.
Ms. Dunhill has volunteered, but it's not possible for her to chaperone alone.
Oh, the hell you do.
Pardon my French, Miss Dunhill.
No, that's what I was going to say.
I knew we made a good decision with you.
Reschedule your commitment, son.
You can thank me later.
Fort Worth will be your home base.
I'll stay here part-time.
The important thing is we'll have eyes on Oswald.
Come on.
I ain't got a thing in the world against niggers.
It was God who cursed 'em to their position, not me.
Can you give us a minute?
Oswald arrives back in a few days.
We're going to live here for six months?
Well, what's it going to be, fellas?
A place like this not gonna be empty long.
Miss Mimi.
Mr. Amberson.
I walked 12 blocks to this station.
Told this gentlemen my predicament.
He just informed me that I cannot buy gas here.
Hold on.
- Can we help you, sir?
- I need some gas.
Oh, let me finish it up for you.
Uh, no, I need it in a can.
Are you kidding me?
Niggertown is a mile across the tracks.
Hey, why don't you shut your fucking mouth?
Excuse my language, Miss Mimi.
I got the equipment all lined up.
Sergeant Pete's bringing it over.
Shut your cakehole, Rafael.
Oh... that one's the man.
We need to take care of guys like that.
Does she speak any English?
Uh, a little.
Where are the reporters?
What reporters?
For the homecoming of the only U.S. Marine ever to defect.
We need to find out when Oswald starts talking about General Walker and who he starts talking about him to.
Yep... just like that.
So what do we got?
Now, look over here.
Like the tenants just left their old radio.
Goddamn shame the Japs pulled ahead in electronics.
We bomb 'em to shit, they're in first anyway.
General Walker's having a rally?
I can introduce you.
He has men over his house once a month, and we all blow about the crisis in America.
Yeah, although I think we have bigger troubles.
I'm sure it's a very subtle mix, so don't jump to any judgments.
Yes.
I think I had the best milkshake of my life in Lisbon.
How long ago were you there?
Two years ago.
Well... to timing.
How do you know how to do this?
My ex-wife made me take lessons.
You're sure they're not gonna be here?
They're staying with his mom right now.
You like?
I-I thought... it would be a little bit nicer.
You want nice?
Well, I got nice.
Come on.
I just... spiders!
Thieving sons of bitches.
You have no right coming here!
They think that they can come into your house.
For leaving.
Oh, did you leave?
What have I told you about smoking in this house?
We have a baby right here, Marina.
What did you say?
Lee's mother ought to be happy that her son's got such a nice-looking wife.
I tell you, I...
No, that's George De Mohrenschildt.
I saw him in Dallas two years ago.
We have to hear if shooting General Walker is George's idea or Lee's.
This might be the start of the whole thing.
Are they going to talk about Walker?
If they do, then we'll know that Lee wasn't acting alone.
Shoot me right now.
Should we walk?
Should we follow 'em?
Rafael?
Jake.
I had no idea how rough it would be for you to chaperone alone, and, look, I was an ass.
Oh, and, Jake... don't ever do anything like that to me again.
It was embarrassing, and I practically broke my back trying to put all those chairs away.
Good.
Rise.
It's now or never!
Do you know what a fascist is?
Racist son of a whore!
Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.
A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.
-It is almost here.
-What is it?
What if it's the Demogorgon?
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
- Troglodytes?
Wait a minute.
- The Demogorgon!
-I don't know!
-Fireball him!
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!
The Demogorgon is tired of your silly human bickering!
-Another stomp, boom!
-Cast Protection.
- He roars in anger!
- Is it a 13?
- I don't know!
You mean the end?
-It's a school night, Michael.
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.
The campaign took two weeks to plan.
How was I supposed to know it was gonna take ten hours?
You've been playing for ten hours?
-Dad, don't you think that 20 more--
-I think you should listen to your mother.
--Dang dumb piece of junk.
Oh, I got it!
-Does the seven count?
-It was a seven?
Yeah, he's cute.
Barb, no, I don't think so.
There's a slice left if you want it.
-Sausage and pepperoni!
-Hold on.
-There's something wrong with your sister.
-What are you talking about?
Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk.
She's always been a real jerk.
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.
Like that time she dressed up as an elf for our Elder tree campaign.
Four years ago!
- Just saying.
The Demogorgon, it got me.
See you tomorrow.
- Good night, ladies.
- Kiss your mom 'night for me.
Get back here!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll take your X-Men 134!
Son of a bitch.
Mom?
Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected, leaving many residents in the dark.
The cause of the outage is still unknown.
We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric, and a spokesperson says that they are confident power will be restored to all remaining homes within the next several hours.
In other news, you might wanna stay home tonight or at least pack an umbrella.
We turn to everybody's favorite morning weather guy, Charles.
Where the hell are they?
-Jonathan?
-Check the couch!
Ugh, I did.
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.
-Yeah, see you later.
-Where's Will?
-Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
-Mom, I'm making breakfast.
-He came home last night, right?
-He's not in his room?
-Did he come home or not?
-I don't know.
You were working?
I can't believe you sometimes.
--That's disgusting.
- You're disgusting!
No, no, no, it's just Mike.
Will didn't spend the night?
No, he left here a little bit after 8:00.
Yeah, he's always paranoid Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
Step right up and get your tickets for the freak show.
Who do you think would make more money in a freak show?
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?
I'd go with Toothless.
I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in.
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.
"I told you a million times."
--Do the arm thing.
Do it, freak!
God, it gets me every time.
- Assholes.
- I think it's kinda cool.
Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.
So, did he call?
Keep your voice down.
Did he?
I told you, it's not like that.
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me, but not like that.
We just... made out a couple times.
"We just... made out a couple times."
Nance, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous.
No, I'm not.
You better still hang out with me, that's all I'm saying.
If you become friends with Tommy H. or Carol--
You were saying?
-In a minute.
Seriously, I have to go.
-Well, then, just let me help.
-Well, in that case...
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?
-I'll climb through your window.
We can find a nice quiet place to park, and...
I'm not kidding.
Well, why do you think I want it to be nice and quiet?
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.
To study.
Good of you to show.
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.
Said some kids are stealing the gnomes out of his garden again.
Oh, those garden gnomes again.
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get right on that.
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.
-Chief, she's already in your--
-Coffee and contemplation, Flo!
I have been waiting here over an hour, Hopper.
And I apologize again.
I'm going out of my mind!
Look, boy his age, he's probably just playing hookie, okay?
He has a couple of friends, but, you know, the kids, they're mean.
-Maybe.
-Is he?
-He's missing is what he is.
When was the last time you heard from Lonnie?
-But he has nothing to do with this.
-Why don't you give me his number?
What about the other time?
-What?
-You said, "99 out of 100."
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
He will talk to me before he talks to--
-What, a pig?
-A cop!
Just find my son, Hop.
Find him!
Dr. Brenner.
This way, gentlemen.
The entire east wing will be evacuated within the hour.
We've sealed off this area following quarantine protocol.
- This is where it came from?
And the girl?
She can't have gone far.
All right, and one more.
You think you can steal from me, boy?
What in the hell?
--Remember, finish chapter 12 and answer 12.3 on the difference between an experiment and other forms of science investigation.
I bet you can talk to New York on this thing.
Think bigger.
-California?
-Bigger.
Australia?
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler, president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.
What are you doing?
Hello, this is Dustin, and this is the secretary and treasurer of Hawkins Middle AV Club.
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow Michael, Lucas and Dustin?
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.
-Well, The Hobbit.
-It doesn't matter.
-We can show you, if you want.
I said that I know it!
That means no biking around looking for your friend, no investigating, no nonsense.
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.
-The Hobbit.
-Shut up!
Do I make myself clear?
Do I make myself... clear?
Password?
Uh, Rada...
So, guess what?
I got off early and...
I changed my mind.
Geez.
Your parents forget to feed you?
Is that why you ran away?
You went to the hospital, you got scared, you ran off, you wound up here, is that it?
We got a deal?
Eleven?
-Well, I'll be damned.
She speaks.
Eleven.
What's it mean?
Eleven.
All right, then.
Here you go.
Take it easy, take it easy.
Yeah, look, all I know is that she's scared to death.
Yeah, I think maybe she's been abused or... kidnapped or something.
Yeah, it'd be great if someone would come by.
Come on, kid!
-That his bike?
-Yeah, he must have crashed.
You think he got hurt in the fall?
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.
Bike like this is like a Cadillac to these kids.
He would've walked it home.
- Can you please--
-I told you, Lonnie's not here.
-Who is this?
- Mom.
-What?
-You have to stay calm.
Hey, you've reached Lonnie.
Leave a message and I'll holler right back at ya.
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.
Cops.
If you found the bike out there, why are you here?
So... maybe he came home.
You think I didn't check my own house?
I'm not saying that.
I don't know.
You're not sure?
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?
I've been calling you.
--What's going on?
I want to get a search party together, all right?
Hey, you think we got a problem here?
-End of discussion.
So... me and Barbara are gonna study at her house tonight.
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.
-This is such bullshit.
-Wait, this is Will's fault?
-You're just pissed off 'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.
-Her new boyfriend.
-You are such a douchebag, Mike!
- Language!
Nancy, come back.
Here, have some juice, okay?
That is really unfair, son.
We care.
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.
What did I do?
He's a good student.
Great one, actually.
I always had a distaste for science.
Well, maybe you had a bad teacher.
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff was a piece of work.
Ratliff?
Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.
Sarah, my daughter...
Your daughter, what grade is she?
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.
-Hey, it's Lucas.
I know it's you.
Over.
What are you doing here?
I told you on the phone, I'm under house arrest now.
-I figured we'd just study here.
What'd I tell you?
Ninja.
You like that ice cream, huh?
Smile looks good on you.
You know, smile?
Ah, Social Services.
-That's a heck of a drive.
I didn't want her running off again.
"Which polymers occur naturally?"
Starch and cellulose.
You said you wanted to help.
Melting point.
Ooh, it's boiling points.
That's what I meant.
Yeah, that's not what you said.
My parents are here.
That's weird, I... don't see them.
Was this your plan all along?
You mean, you're not a slut.
That's not what I'm saying.
You know, you're so cute when you lie.
Shut up.
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.
"Compared to the rate of inorganic reactions, the rate of organic reactions is generally..."
These are great.
Wow, they really are.
-Hopper?
--Who is this?
--Mom, it's Will?
- Who is this?
Guys, I really think we should turn back.
Seriously, Dustin?
You wanna be a baby, then go home already!
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!
No, you're just being a big sissy!
Did you ever think Will went missing because he ran into something bad?
And we're going to the exact same spot where he was last seen?
-And we have no weapons or anything?
-Dustin, shut up.
I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you?
This the wall she was talking about, Chief?
A trooper found something in the, uh... water that's at the quarry.
The earth must have given way.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Whoever you found... is not my boy.
No, you don't understand.
I talked to him... a half hour ago.
One blink for yes, two for no.
'Cause he was hiding... from that... that thing.
It was some kind of animal, you said?
It didn't have a face?
I didn't know what was real.
This is different.
-I'm just saying that you--
-No, I know what you're saying, Hop.
I swear to you, I know what I saw.
And I'm not crazy.
I'm not saying that you're crazy.
And I understand, but...
It'll give you the answers that you need.
Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry by state police earlier this evening.
It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark.
The state police are mounting an investigation to determine Byers' cause of death, but an initial inquiry...
--Should I go down and talk to Michael?
Give him time.
He'll come to us when he's ready.
Can you please stop that?
Are you deaf?
What you did sucks.
Over.
What... what time is it?
To see Will.
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.
I need to drop off Nance, then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.
Why don't you grab a book or something and come with me?
I think I just want to stay home today.
I mean, if that's okay?
Well, are you sure you're gonna be all right here by yourself?
I think so.
Lucas, do you copy?
Lucas, come on, I know you're there!
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.
I'm not in the mood, all right?
Over and out.
No, not "out."
I'm not messing around, okay?
This is about Will.
-Over.
-What about Will?
What's taking so long?
Well, everything's been a bit chaotic around here without Gary.
Without Gary?
-Where's Gary?
-Well, I thought you knew.
So who did the autopsy?
Someone from State.
He has a birth mark on his right arm.
Can you show that to me, please?
Since the first phone call, I guess.
You know, she's had anxiety problems... in the past.
She'll be okay.
We'll be okay.
My mom... she's tough.
Yeah, she is.
To look for Barb.
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you just talk to me?
That's crazy.
You seriously think you saw a guy in a mask just hanging out in my yard?
I don't think it was a mask.
But he had no face?
What?
The cops... they're gonna want to talk to all of us now.
Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party.
Are you serious right now?
I can't believe you right now.
Nancy, wait!
Mom, will you just get in, please?
-Just go home, Jonathan.
And there's a monster in the wall?
Do you even hear yourself?
I know it sounds crazy.
It is crazy!
But I heard him, Jonathan.
He talked to me!
Will is... is calling to me!
I am not gonna stop looking for him until I find him and bring him home.
I am going to bring him home!
Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are having a funeral for Will!
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day!
All right, show's over.
We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right?
Yeah, I heard a baby.
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?
Words!
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Are you sure you're on the right channel?
I don't think it's about that.
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.
-Like... like Professor X.
I don't know, I mean...
Did you guys not see what I saw?
They pulled Will's body out of the water.
He's dead!
-It's not his ghost.
-So how do you know that?
-I just do!
He's out there somewhere.
All we have to do is find him.
This isn't gonna work.
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo in there without anyone noticing.
-Pretty.
-You boys hear me all right in there?
-Loud and clear, Shepard.
Good luck in there, son.
If you'll come with me, please?
It wasn't really an argument.
Barb just wanted to leave.
Then what?
Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes.
And the next day, you went back and... saw a bear, you're thinking?
-There's no sign of a bear.
-And no car.
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy?
Uh, Steve Harrington?
It wasn't like that.
Like what?
Now was this before or after you changed out of your clothes?
So, Gary, tell me about these troopers that brought in Will.
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.
They're all Staties?
Yes, sir.
Never seen that many troopers come with a body before.
They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh?
Considering what?
Considering this was Will Byers and not John F. Kennedy.
-Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
-Sure thing.
...let the people know that, uh, the troopers are on duty and you should be safe, because we think this is just an isolated incident.
Okay, remember, if anyone sees us, look sad.
Attention students, there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now.
Do not go to fourth period.
It's locked.
Boys?
Upset.
Yeah, definitely upset.
And then... the Heathkit is all yours for the rest of the day.
She's here for Will's funeral.
Uh, where are you from exactly?
Bad place--
- She hates it there.
At times like these... it is important that we come together as a community.
Abort.
We come together to heal... we come together to grieve...
-You lied to the police!
-I didn't lie!
How naive do you think I am?
You and Steve were just talking?
We slept together!
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!
Try him again.
Shepard, come in.
--Reel him in.
- Reel him back in!
- Get him in.
- Shepard, come in.
Will Byers' death is an unimaginable tragedy.
Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us.
It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community.
Look at these fakers.
This is so stupid.
Oh, he's going to leave a hole in the community.
Mouth breather.
You... you think this is funny?
What'd you say, Wheeler?
I saw you guys laughing over there.
And I think that's a real messed up thing to do.
Didn't you listen to the counselor, Wheeler?
Grief shows itself in funny ways.
Besides, what's there to be sad about, anyway?
Will's in fairyland now, right?
Flying around with all the other little fairies.
All happy and gay!
Dude, Troy peed himself.
Holy shit!
It's made of soft wood with a crepe interior.
Can you just give me a second?
Of course.
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.
Can we talk for a second?
It looks like it could be some kind of perspective distortion, but I wasn't using the wide angle.
And you're sure you didn't see anyone else out there?
The cops think that she ran away.
But they don't know Barb.
And I went back to Steve's... and I thought I... saw something.
I'm sorry.
What?
This man you saw in the woods.
What'd he look like?
I don't know.
It was almost like he... he didn't have--
How did you know that?
Another, please.
And another for my, uh, friend here.
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
You know what it means?
It's a fancy name for a toothache.
Your daughter, she got a name?
Sarah.
Her name's Sarah.
To Sarah.
I recognize you.
Are you famous or somethin'?
So, you on that case or what?
I just saw him on patrol, you know?
Dumb luck.
So that quarry, that's, uh... that's state-run, where they found the boy, huh?
-Is that right?
That's right.
So why are you lying to me, man?
What's your problem, bud?
I don't have a problem.
I'm just a concerned citizen.
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.
Who told you to be out there?
What were you doing out there?
They... they just told me to call it in and not let anybody get too close.
Get close to what?
The body.
- Who is that?
Talk to me!
I know you're here!
-Now what?
-She'll find him.
Right, El?
Eleven?
Are you listening?
- Hurt him?
I want you to listen to him.
I want you to listen to what he says and repeat his words back to me.
Just like we used to with those old nursery rhymes.
Do you remember?
Begin.
Amulet.
Frigid.
Evolve.
Airplane.
Repeat the words.
Apricot.
Peninsula.
Game.
Enchantment.
Mouse.
Balloon.
She's doing it.
What is that?
No way!
Oh, thank God.
Tell me where you are!
Can you move?
Here, help her up.
--This way!
And you're...
- Did your mom say anything else?
Like, um, where it might have gone to, or...
- No, just that it came out of the wall.
How long does this take?
Not long.
Have you been... doing this a while?
What?
I guess I'd rather observe people than, you know...
It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking.
But you capture the right moment... it says more.
What was I saying?
I shouldn't have taken that.
That's what I saw.
-Then Barbara.
-Hey, Patty!
-Hey, uh, need something, Chief?
-It's some emergency...
-What the hell are you talking about?
Where are you?
Jonathan, I'm right here!
Jonathan, where are you?
I got you.
I just don't understand why we're coming out here.
-What?
-Aw, you are.
-Aw, Steve has a heart.
I'll just be a minute.
Look, we gotta go through this again.
-Upstairs.
-How do you know it was a kid's room?
-More like a prison.
So why would you think it was a kid's room, then?
Because, I told you, the size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal--
You didn't say there was a drawing.
-It said "Eleven" on it.
-Was it good?
Wasn't Will.
Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe...
Look... this woman, Terry Ives, she claims to have lost her daughter, Jane.
Better?
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.
Can you just come up here?
- Do you want the lights off, or--
You know, it... it can't get us in here.
We don't know that.
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.
I really appreciate this, Frank.
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?
Couldn't sleep?
Every time I close my eyes, I just... keep seeing that... thing.
It was feeding there.
Feeding on that deer.
That means that if... if Will and Barbara...
My mom said she talked to Will.
If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too.
That means that she's trapped... in that place.
We have to find it again.
You wanna go back out there?
Maybe we don't have to.
When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer.
-Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
-Right.
It's always alone, like... like a bear.
And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself?
-And then, last night, the deer...
-Hmm, it was bleeding, too.
So you're saying it can detect blood?
It's just a theory.
We could test it.
But if it works...
At least we'll know it's coming.
I'll be down in a second.
--Your mom doesn't knock?
Oh, wonderful.
Oh, that's neat.
What we're really trying to do here, Mr. Clarke--
Uh, please, call me Scott.
What we're trying to do here, Scott, is to connect kids from all over the state and give them the support and encouragement to pursue careers in technology.
We feel these are the kinds of kids that are going to make Indiana proud.
So, you know any kids you think might wanna participate?
Oh, I have a few in mind.
- She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.
She just messed up the compasses because she wanted to protect us.
-She didn't betray us.
-Mike, calm down.
-Mike, this isn't your fault.
-Yeah, it's Lucas'.
It wasn't his fault, either.
-It wasn't his fault?
-Oh, give me a break!
No, Mike, you give me a break!
All three of you were being a bunch of little assholes!
I was the only reasonable one.
This is the rule of law.
-Good.
Where are we going?
Where do you think?
Today is a very special day.
Do you know why?
Because today, we make history.
Today, we make contact.
Here you go.
She is.
What do you want?
I drew first blood, so...
Okay, I'll shake.
Guys, seriously?
Do you even remember what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor--
She was just trying to keep us safe!
An accident?
Yeah, she threw you in the air with her mind!
I could have been killed!
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!
Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?
That's like R2-D2 going to fight Darth Vader.
We're no use to Will if we're dead.
These are all friends.
They're just here to watch.
Don't focus on them.
Stay in here, like before.
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.
It's reaching out to you... 'cause it wants you.
I want you to find it.
Understand?
Are you lost?
Is your mom here?
Your dad?
Mouth breather.
Call the police.
You know you have to pay for those!
Can I help you?
-Who's asking?
-The Hawkins chief of police.
And you want to talk to my sister?
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives, then, yeah, we do.
Okay, well, you can come in, but if you want Terry to tell you anything, you're about five years too late.
Terry, you have some visitors.
Um, you see, uh, my son... he's been missing for almost a week now, and, um, we were wondering if we could talk to you about your daughter, Jane?
If there's anything that you could tell us about when she was taken...
What was your relationship with Dr. Brenner?
You guys keep in touch?
I told you, you're wasting your time.
This is weird without Lucas.
-He should've shaken my hand.
-He's just jealous.
What are you talking about?
Sometimes, your total obliviousness just blows my mind.
He's your best friend, right?
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
What matters is that he is your best friend.
And then this girl shows up and starts living in your basement, and all you ever want to do is pay attention to her.
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything until you both start punching and yelling at each other like goblins with intelligence scores of zero.
-Now everything's weird.
-He's not my best friend.
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, he is, but so are you.
-And so is Will.
Well, I call bull on your logic, because you're my best friend, too.
--You don't think...
Uh... definitely.
-Yeah, that's the one.
Was, uh, started in the '50s.
By the time Terry got involved, it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier.
Messed her up good.
This was the CIA that ran this?
You and Terry would've gotten along.
You lose any sense of, uh... sense and feel nothing, see nothing.
They wanted to expand the boundaries of the mind.
Jane.
Do you have any pictures of her?
I don't think you guys understand.
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.
Abilities?
You read any Stephen King?
You guys look scared, actually.
I mean, it's all make-believe.
What... what kind of abilities?
Telepathy, telekinesis...
You know, shit you can do with your mind.
That's why the big, bad Man stole Jane away.
Her baby's a weapon, off fighting the commies.
Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth?
About having had the kid.
There is no birth certificate, nothing from the hospital.
Doctors and nurses all confirm that she miscarried.
Like I said, you and Terry would've gotten along.
Oh, man.
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.
What you kids doin' with all this?
"Monster hunting"?
It took me and Barb all weekend.
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now--
You're shopping for bear traps with Jonathan Byers.
What's the weirdest part?
Me or the bear trap?
Can't wait to see your movie.
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
What?
--Nancy, wait!
- Shut up!
- I didn't know you could spell.
Aw, hey there, princess!
I can't believe that I was actually worried about you.
-What are you talking about?
-I wouldn't lie if I were you.
You don't want to be known as the lying slut now, do you?
Speak of the devil.
Look, I don't know what you think you saw, but it wasn't like that.
What, you just let him into your room to... study?
Or for another pervy photo session?
Finish that sentence.
Finish the sentence.
Go to hell, Nancy.
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.
Steve, shut up!
I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you, but the Byers, their family, it's a disgrace to the entire--
- Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!
-You have to stop!
-Just go, Carol!
Calm him down!
- Get off!
- I got this one!
Hmm, yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
What?
We're gonna find him.
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?
And then she shows up at Benny's five nights ago, which means we've got a chance.
You know what I would give?
-Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, a fight broke out here and--
-Cal, I don't have time for this.
-It's Jonathan Byers.
You haven't seen Joyce, have you?
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?
--Well, how long are you gonna keep him?
You and your boyfriend have big plans, do you?
He's not my boyfriend.
I think you better tell him that.
Only love makes you that crazy, sweetheart.
And that damn stupid.
Found some ice.
Everything okay?
Everything's fine.
Hey, there, Frogface.
Toothless.
Shit!
Run, Mike!
-What?
You're dead, Wheeler.
-Stay back!
-Don't come any closer!
--Nice throw, numbnuts.
You mean piss your pants?
Our friend has superpowers, and she squeezed your tiny bladder with her mind.
- Shut up!
I think I should save Toothless here a trip to the dentist.
I'll let him go, sure.
- But first... it's your turn.
My turn for what?
Wet yourself.
-What?
-Jump... or Toothless here gets an early trip to the dentist.
I'll cut him right now!
Mike, seriously, don't!
Troy, I don't think this is a good idea, man.
Mike, don't!
Holy shit.
Go.
She's our friend and she's crazy!
You come back here and she'll kill you!
You hear me?
She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!
She'll kill you, you hear me?
I'm the monster.
Do you understand?
I have eyes on 'em now.
Let me out of here!
Somebody, please!
Let me out!
Your son.
We know you've been in contact with him.
- You have to let me...
- When... and how did you make contact with him?
Six.
What?
Six.
Six people have been taken this week.
Like all animals... it eats.
I want to save them.
I want to save your son.
Stop.
You faked his death!
And now you're asking for my help?
Go to hell.
Okay, now what do you know?
What do you know?
I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids, whose parents' brains you've turned to mush.
And I know you went a little too far this time and you messed up in a big way.
I mean, you really messed up, didn't you?
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.
You're just a junkie.
You made a mistake coming back here.
No, I didn't.
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go... you're gonna give us anything we need, and we're gonna find her son.
And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened.
Oh, is that right?
That's right.
Demogorgon.
Where's the girl?
You gotta give me your word.
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.
And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone.
I don't understand.
We came to an agreement.
What is this?
Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.
That's not gonna happen.
Deep breath in... and out.
Remember...
On three.
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...
Yeah, and we don't even know where your sister is.
I still think we should stick to the chief's plan.
Well, where are you going?
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.
Are you serious?
El needs to be recharged!
Did you hear that?
It's just the wind.
Speak?
Blink.
Think of them as alarms.
It's... it's Steve!
Listen, I just want to talk!
Nothing.
It was an accident.
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.
You have five seconds to get out of here.
- It's here.
- Wait, what's here?
What's it doing?
I don't know.
"I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions.
And what does make roads red?
'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.
It just makes me feel glad to be alive... it's such an interesting world."
It's going to come back!
Where is it?
Where are you?
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!
He's in the trap!
- He's stuck!
- Jonathan, now!
Did you hear that?
Get back!
It was hurt.
Joyce, come on.
Where's it going?
I don't think that's the monster.
Found it!
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!
What's "putting"?
Pudding, it's... it's this chocolate goo you eat with a spoon.
Don't worry, when all this is over, you won't have to keep eating junk food and leftovers like a dog anymore.
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.
She can make you whatever you like.
See, I was thinking, once all this is over and Will's back and you're not a secret anymore, my parents can get you an actual bed for the basement.
Or you can take my room if you want, since I'm down there all the time anyways.
My point is, they'll take care of you.
They'll be like your new parents, and Nancy, she'll be like your new sister.
No, no.
Why "no"?
Because... 'cause it's different.
Why?
I mean, I don't know, I guess it's not.
It's stupid.
I've never been, but I know you're not supposed to go with your sister.
You go to school dances with someone that, you know... someone that you like.
Uh, someone like a...
Nancy.
Go!
They found us.
We know they're here.
Be advised, west side of the building is clear.
Nothin'.
Keep it locked down.
How did they find us?
El, are you okay?
There's more blood.
Oh, my God.
This way.
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.
Leave her.
- Get off of me.
I'm going to take you back home, where I can make you well again.
Where we can make all of this better, so no one else gets hurt.
Bad.
Blood.
What?
Blood.
Demogorgon.
Get him out!
Oh, Jesus.
Help, help.
Come on, get her on the table.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?
We'll be home soon, and my mom... she'll get you your own bed.
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.
And we can go to the Snow Ball.
Promise?
Promise.
Go, go, go, go!
- Give me another one.
Eleven, stop!
Goodbye, Mike.
No more.
El, where are you?
He's not breathing, he's not breathing.
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.
Please, please.
Breathe, Will, come on!
Flatlining!
Come back to me, breathe.
Good, good, good, good.
Where... where am I?
You're safe.
Yeah, it's me, buddy.
Are you okay?
What, this?
You're worried about my hand.
There's some stuff on there I think you really might like.
You won't believe what happened when you were gone, man.
You okay?
It got me.
The Demogorgon.
We know.
But she's gone now.
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?
Well, we call her "El" for short.
She's basically a wizard.
She has superpowers.
And blood was pouring out of their faces.
Hungry for your blood.
It is almost here.
The thessalhydra!
Fireball the son of a bitch.
Fourteen!
It makes a painful... and then... it crumbles to the ground.
You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious, and you present them to King Tristan.
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?
And the proud princess?
- Bye, Will.
No, you stop.
Merry Christmas.
It's, um...
Well, you'll see.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, pretty cool.
You leaving already, Chief?
Merry Christmas, Hop.
What you got there?
Oh, why?
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.
- It's definitely an Atari.
He's washing his hands?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Tristan de Martel guided this organization for centuries.
He was a radical thinker, a decisive leader, and to each of us here tonight, both mentor and friend.
He was, in a word, irreplaceable.
To Tristan de Martel.
Though we grieve his loss, I will not allow that defeat to hamper our cause.
Was it loyalty or something else?
A loyal knight.
I will not tolerate anyone conspiring to use our present circumstances as an opportunity for a power grab.
And you, Marcel Gerard, do you seek to betray me for power, as well?
I'm hurt that you even have to ask.
Despite what Elijah Mikaelson may have us believe, the prophecy of his demise is all too real, and a threat to our sire is a threat against us.
Because I got a few thoughts on your customer service that, trust me, you do not want to end up on yelp.
Josh, let's just go.
I'm taking these.
Where the bloody hell is she?
I assume we are talking about Camille.
I shall deal with the growing nightmare of our family's potential extinction.
Yes, always the diligent defender, despite the fact the threat has somewhat subsided, what with Tristan de Martel now literally sleeping with the fishes.
A darker threat remains.
She left around sunrise.
So, um, I was wondering, if maybe it was ok if Hope and I stay here for a few days.
Hayley, this family comes with many, many hardships, but there is at least one benefit.
I think we both know I won't leave until this prophecy is averted.
Somewhere out there is an elusive weapon capable of killing an Original.
I'm calling to suggest we pool our efforts to find it.
I don't play well with others.
Lucien's witch Alexis left her clues in a rather cryptic puzzle.
What if I told you I had the means to put it together?
Davina, I called, like, a billion times.
The thing is, this is kind of the whole reason you have friends, so you don't have to do the terrible parts alone.
Hello, Joshua.
Damn, girl, you look amazing.
You know, I feel amazing.
Hey, 4 Tequila shots stat, and don't be afraid to move that sweet ass.
Real nice.
She works hard, you know.
Then you're gonna meet me in the alley out back so we can have some real fun, and turn your hat around.
However, I have found that witches for hire can only be trusted so far, and so... meet the Sisters, wayward souls with an extraordinary capacity for magic.
Of course, when I found them, they were nothing but orphans and outcasts belonging nowhere and with no one until they found a home here with us.
So the Strix have their own personal coven.
Think of them as consultants held on retainer.
If your 9 covens are a burning candle, what you see before you is a 5 alarm fire.
In fact, they are the only coven in the world capable of casting this...
The spell to raise the dead.
How did you know?
The Sisters search the unknown and reveal to me anything that may be of use, for instance, the leverage I need to make you my ally.
What do you want from me?
I'll make certain you're granted the power to bring back your precious Kol.
In exchange, you will take a vow of fealty and become one of my Sisters.
That which you most wish for is within your grasp.
The question is, are you willing to pay the price?
You would've torn him apart whether you meant to or not, probably doing the world a favor in the process, but...
Isn't that what you do all the time?
What I do and what you do are not the same thing.
My emotions are all over the place.
I feel like someone turned up the volume on my life and I can't hear myself think, and everything feels so good, but it's all happening all at once.
So let me help you, and I promise you will live a life others only dream of.
Josh, the witches won't even look at me, let alone help me.
This is me putting it down for once, ok, for your own good.
What do I need to do?
Whatever happens, don't let go, ok?
You're my link to the living.
Josh?
Ariane, come forward, please.
This is your secret weapon?
She's untrained, of course, but she's shown a spark of talent which, in itself, is unbelievably rare.
Witches like Ariane spend years absorbing all manner of information.
They see patterns in the chaos in part because they view history as a whole.
Sadly, we don't have that kind of time.
Water will act as a conductor, allowing me to enter your mind to know everything you know to see and understand everything that you've learned in a thousand years.
Think of it as a crash course into your mind, garnering just enough information to answer the only question that matters.
What do you want to take, your little knight?
What about horsey?
Oh, you are a sight for bleary and battered eyes.
You're also stark raving mad.
Young, healthy, a tad unsophisticated, but not bad.
I am myself, and I'm not finished, and, by the way, I resent the critique.
I spent the last two years listening to every malicious thing you've ever done.
How many hundreds of people have you killed, Klaus?
Actually, I measure the number in the hundreds of thousands, leaving me no hope of absolution.
It's not a fate I wish for you.
You don't get it.
I've always tried to get you to be something else, something more human, and I was wrong.
You are exactly what you're meant to be, and now I'm just like you.
You're still learning what you are.
Can't complain, back on the job, which I have the strangest feeling is somehow thanks to you.
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
Bottom line, you don't belong here.
Luckily, the ancestors aren't big pub goers, more of the graveyard and goat sacrifice types.
We should be all right here till we can figure out how to get you back.
I'm still adjusting, not to mention we're in a freaky ghost land, so...
It's nothing, really.
Oh, these are gonna come in really handy.
Why am I doing everything you say?
This is crazy... breaking and entering, grand larceny.
- Because I can't go in myself.
But why are you doing this?
Because I have been the victim in someone else's story one too many times.
What can I say?
I've changed.
Looks like someone's trying to put one over on you.
More than anything, Davina Claire, but do you have any idea how dangerous that spell is?
I haven't seen anything even remotely like it since... the Strix coven.
Please tell me you haven't done something foolish.
Find another way, luv, not with them.
Nothing is worth what they'll make you do.
Well, that's funny because I seem to remember my brother Kol making them, so perhaps they've been my family's legacy all along.
Give them back, or I will take them back, and I swear you will regret this moment.
The only thing I regret is failing to realize how far you've spun out of control, and you can forget about leaving.
She was right, wasn't she, Aurora?
I'm out of your control, and you hate it, don't you?
You are a scared, little kid convinced he'll be tossed aside the second he isn't needed.
You can't just force her to stay here, Klaus.
I hardly thing now is the time for a women's empowerment meeting.
She died, Klaus, because she got caught up in the Mikaelson world just like me, just like Jackson, so, yeah, she and I have ‭a few things to talk about.
Niklaus...
A word.
Hello, Davina.
I thought the pale horse might be something biblical or even tied to one of the equestrian constellations.
There's Pegasus, perhaps even Equuleus.
Neither of those sounds like a weapon unless they plan to bore us to death.
You know, it would be nice if, just once, the witches bloody well said what they mean.
Camille has just turned, Niklaus.
Leave her be.
You think I should abandon her, then?
She's already served as a pawn in Aurora's games.
I know it may not seem like it right now, but what you're going through, it does get better, and there are people around you that are willing to get you to that part.
I mean, that is why you wanted to speak to me, right, to get some words of wisdom from the Mikaelson family therapist?
You're in love with Elijah, and now that Jackson's gone, you're free.
You're going through a really hard time right now, Cami, but you are never ever to speak to me of my husband again.
Why would I say that?
I think I wanted to make you feel pain like I do, and so I said an evil, unfair thing, an untrue thing, Hayley.
You just need time.
All right. ‭That's about enough out of you.
I can help you cross back, but we have to go now.
Where is Camille?
She went home.
She needed some time, and, yes, I let her go.
I know you think you're helping, but all you're doing is pissing her off, and that's the last thing that she needs, trust me.
I really don't think th...
Listen, Klaus.
The Cami that you knew is gone, and whoever she's gonna be is something that she has to figure out by herself.
What?
What you just said, keeping Rebekah safe.
He can't come where we're going, not yet.
I know you're scared, but you have to concentrate.
Focus on what you love most.
Recall the thing that makes you want to live.
Fight with that in mind.
Klaus, you're not making any sense.
The pale horse, it isn't a constellation, nor is is a biblical verse.
It's a... a trinket I made when we were children, a toy carved from kindling which I gave to Rebekah in the hopes of easing her fears.
The horse was made of the white oak.
That weapon is here.
Josh, you awake?
It's both the blessing and curse of his kind.
Wait.
Aya said that the witches of your coven were granted the power to have your greatest heart's desire.
Did you make that deal?
Yes, and I will answer your real question, as well.
This afternoon, I swear.
Neither of those sounds like a weapon.
There is only one other person capable of deciphering the witch's riddle, the very person with whom I shared my memories of that night... my trusted therapist.
Um, I guess getting shunned is a slippery slope.
Josh, I know I didn't give you much of a choice today...
Any choice, just to be clear.
I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.
In point of fact, you do.
You found it...
Which means you've come to kill me.
We both know I have no more answers to give you, and you cannot allow me to live with what I've seen...
The things you keep hidden.
Ah, seems like we've both been busy.
So what you been up to?
Been doing a lot of thinking about what's important... friends.
I guess that's what happens when you steal the one thing that can kill her entire family.
I wouldn't have taken it if Klaus hadn't confiscated my dark objects, so technically this is his fault.
You try explaining that to him.
I have it all worked out...
You put up a boundary spell Klaus can't enter.
If he wants what's his, he'll give me back what's mine.
Those dark objects were made by New Orleans witches.
Cami, you got to see the mess you're in.
You jacked the one weapon that can kill the most powerful vampires in the world.
You got a target on your back.
- Klaus wouldn't hurt me.
I'm going to take your silence as a resounding agreement with my very reasonable plan.
- Now all I have to do is invite Klaus.
- Cami, are you sure you want to do this?
What happened to her?
This is what befalls anyone who bargains with Elijah Mikaelson.
Ariane discovered the weapon that could kill an Original.
She was nice to me.
Then perhaps you won't mind spending a little more time together.
You and the others will channel her, search her mind and find the weapon.
It's a little disrespectful to the dead, don't you think?
I know better than you how dangerous Elijah can be.
And yet, as he is my sire, my life and the lives of the Strix are tied to his.
So that's how it is.
You recruit a witch from my city and you don't even tell me.
I'm not in the habit of explaining my decisions to subordinates.
She's just a kid.
You are in no position to make demands.
If the prophecy is true, the Mikaelsons will fall within the year and us along with them.
I have a plan that will keep us alive.
Perhaps you should focus on proving yourself essential to my plan.
As I send you off to join your ancestors, just know this is her fault.
Why don't you take down this barrier?
I'll show you precisely what my style entails.
Seriously?
Yes, a rather effective tactic.
One I usually reserve for enemies, and here I thought we were intimates.
We are.
But relationships are built on trust and equality, and we don't have either if you're confiscating my stuff.
And so your response is to steal what's mine in an attempt to bend my will to your own.
I just want back what you took.
What, that's, like, a third of them?
Okay, listen, I'm gonna leave you two lovebirds alone, but, uh, y'all want my advice, y'all best to finish this up before someone finds out what she took.
Okay, so what's the plan?
Cami's out there with the white oak and I'm not gonna lose one more person that I care about.
Why don't you just kill her?
She and I have history.
You two had a thing?
Aya was a towering intellect with an insatiable curiosity.
Passionate, fearless and something of an outcast.
Long ago, I invited her... to join a rather elite company.
She was one of the first Strix.
We cared for one another deeply.
Together we created a fellowship unburdened by the limitations of man.
It was the pursuit of a glorious new world.
And then father...
Come with me.
Aya did not.
And in time, beneath his corrupted guidance, they made the Strix what they are today... a hive of depraved and ignorant savages.
And she's never forgiven me.
I'm not entirely certain I've ever forgiven myself.
We're getting nowhere.
And we won't stop until we get what we need.
When I was a little girl I remember being told that a witch who wasn't consecrated would never know peace.
The ancestors may hate me, but at the end of the day, witches take care of their own.
... Trinket I made when we were children.
You found it, which means you've come to kill me.
I think you need to calm down, count to ten, focus on your breathing.
Is this amusing to you?
Endangering my family?
Am I laughing?
I want to put this all behind us.
You of all people know what I am capable of, and yet you seem determined to incur my wrath.
I'm gonna ask you one last time...
My answer is, happily, as soon as you stop screwing around and give me back what's mine.
You will grow arrogant under the false belief you have power and ultimately you will end up dead.
Klaus, you're afraid something will happen to me?
Guess what, something already did.
Your ex hates me so much, she murdered me.
She's gonna have to pay for that.
Fine.
I'll retrieve your toys.
Keep this bloody barrier up till I return.
We can only assume a weapon is in play and that all our lives are at risk.
We will not rest until that weapon is under our control.
Hello, everyone.
Wonderful to see you all.
Aya, don't we look so very comfortable indeed leading Tristan's little circus.
Sadly, one does not simply ascend to the position of leader.
Kind of has to be by my consent.
You see, I am the maker, the creator, the founding father.
Do I hear any objections?
So ladies and gentlemen, the offer I extend to you is simple enough.
You follow me, I shall return you all to greatness.
Aya, how long has it been... eight, 900 years since you saw this?
If you were determined to stake this absurd claim as founder, then I invoke the right of Ludum Regale.
I'm sorry, does someone want to please explain what the hell that is?
You cannot invoke one element of the charter and disregard the rest.
If our leadership is in doubt and politics proves divisive, a contest of strength and cunning shall determine the line of succession.
So, I challenge you to a duel.
Whomever holds the charter at the stroke of midnight shall be the new leader of the Strix.
You would choose strength over cunning?
Do you accept?
Our daughter has been upset.
She's still dealing with the fact that Jack is gone, and the only thing that calms her is her favorite toy, which Cami stole to get back at you.
So, if you wake her up with all this slamming around, so help me, Cami will be the least of your problems.
I know that you're angry at Cami, Klaus, but you know as well as I do that she's not in her right mind.
Anything you care to share with the group?
Oh, we're really gonna do this.
I could order my brethren to fight on my behalf.
Such is their loyalty.
Come get it.
Klaus should be back by now.
He's got a lot of witch weapons to pack up, not to mention all the pride he's gonna have to swallow.
But you got to admit, you poked a real irritable bear.
Things are gonna be different between you two.
I know Klaus better than anyone outside of his family.
- Okay, well, here's the thing.
That girl is dead.
If I knew something, I'd tell you.
We're supposed to be sisters now, right?
I don't know about that.
Is that what this is?
Pick on the new girl 'cause she knows a few vampires?
She already has.
She gave me the spell to help the person that I care about more than anything.
All I need now is power, and I'll do whatever I have to to get it.
I was just a kid when I became a sister.
My family was poor, my mother was sick.
All I wanted was to help them.
See, Davina, real magic, like we use here... it would change you.
My guess is, it'll be right after you've saved that person you care about.
That's when you'll lose everything.
All I care about is leaving this damn coven.
But first you're gonna tell me what you know.
You quite done?
You'd have me submit?
Once again, I prove I have a mind of my own.
Let's not make this more unpleasant than it needs to be.
After all this time, how could you think that we would follow you?
All of you swore loyalty to a serpent who seized control of this fellowship, all in the name of furthering his tyranny.
Seize control... is that how you rewrite history?
You ran like a coward, leaving Strix to be slaughtered by your mad father.
I had no choice.
We all have a choice!
And that day I watched as my fellow Strix were slaughtered by the dozens.
I returned.
The moment I knew that my family was safe, I returned... to the horror... the wreckage, the corpses, the ruin.
Tristan saved us!
He earned our loyalty.
You're as cursed as them.
This is Elijah Mikaelson, traitor to our cause!
You know I would rather die than accept you as leader.
If that's your ultimatum... then I accept.
I thought you two were gonna talk each other to death.
If someone's playing games, just know the contest ends when I claim...
Camille!
Still, I can't imagine that this turn of events will improve your odds.
The game's not over.
When the Strix find Marcel, they'll take back the charter and hand-deliver it to me.
Interesting.
Of course, Marcel is very popular with the locals.
I wouldn't be too concerned.
Camille!
She can't hear you.
As a matter of fact, pretty soon now, she'll be dead.
I hope you two parted on good terms.
Show yourself.
You're one of the coven affiliated with the Strix.
My sisters and I have come for the one thing that can kill you.
Well, perhaps I'll find your sisters and feed them what remains of your insides.
I have a better idea.
Where have you been?
We're not alone.
How is that even possible?
What happened to the boundary spell?
This here is hallowed ground, home to the nine covens of New Orleans.
Okay, I'm gonna give you one guess what they're here for.
Who the hell are you?
Does it really matter?
You know what I've come for.
Hand it over.
I'm not going to ask twice.
You have a high tolerance for pain.
Let's see how high.
No.
Well, this little escapade has been very cute indeed, Marcel.
I got about three minutes until I'm the new Grand Poobah.
Until then, good luck trying to find me.
Look outside.
It's not difficult to track your enemies when your sister's a witch.
Well, in that case, good luck getting in without an invitation.
If you think I'm above burning this place to the ground, you are gravely mistaken.
Well, that's not very civilized, is it?
Elijah?
Please come in.
You realize this is your doing.
Your apologies won't bring back what's been lost.
Then shut up and let vincent track down that witch!
Where do you think you're going?
I want to find her just as much as you do, but I cannot concentrate, not with this pointless bickering.
Well, then, by all means, please, go, attend to your task.
You, however, are not going to leave my sight!
Ridiculous.
I had a little time to read your charter.
The ludum regale was never meant to be just a fistfight.
Aspiring leaders face off in a contest that requires cunning.
Why?
Because you want a leader with more brains than brawn.
Reason I beat you all is because I know every nook and cranny in the Quarter.
Underground tunnels, secret passageways between properties.
Hey, you kill me, You are in violation of your own damn charter.
Nobody's gonna follow your rules if you can't follow them yourself.
That's how I drove them out of New Orleans in the first place.
Rebuilt this city in my image under my rules.
Offered alliances to all of my friends and got rid of everybody else.
This is my city because I took it.
That is what a leader does!
If this prophecy that you're all afraid of is gonna happen, it's gonna happen here, on my streets.
And if we're gonna stop it from killing us all, who's a better leader than me?
This is absurd.
Marcel has won.
To the new leader of the Strix...
Marcel Gerard.
What were you thinking?
I would have been.
Thank God I had my dark objects.
If you had just given me what I asked for...
Do not blame me.
It's the same story with you, Klaus.
For a thousand years you-you control, you manipulate, you do whatever you need to do to get your way.
- Answer your bloody phone, would you?
One of the Strix witches knows where you are and she knows that you have the white oak.
You're a little late, kiddo.
She already took it, which means, I guess, the Strix have it now.
You know, I'm so glad that I can rely on you.
You've more than earned your reward.
And now you will help me.
You had to punch your hand through my chest.
Oh, for the love...
How are you here?
You consecrated me.
Can you help him?
I have killed many, many people for far less than what you've done.
I may not yet know who I am or what I am, but I do know I will never live in fear of anyone again.
You could have trusted me.
Klaus...
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
You've no idea where to begin, do you?
Well, give or take an intermission or two.
First thing I'd like to do is make sure I know who's on my side.
As leader, how would you navigate that threat?
And by the look in your eyes, it looks like you have some advice to give.
So... spill it.
There is a reason I recruited Davina Claire.
So what do you say?
Will you lead the Strix to freedom?
I trust Freya had no luck finding that witch.
Aurora's involvement changes everything.
I always did loathe irony.
I finished the last one.
Fabulous.
Not an animal at all, darling.
A monster.
An entire family of them.
In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child.
I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power.
In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.
I let you go, you'll deliver the Waverider.
Boys, ship's all yours.
You're a liability to the team.
Only one of us is walking out of here alive.
Tommy, promise me you won't go too fast.
What's that?
I think that's a comet or something.
It's a meteorite, in point of fact.
I was drawn to it as well.
Your presence out here was unexpected.
Or perhaps that's just another word for... destiny.
Yes, as I mentioned before, the effect of time travel on the human body increases with the length of each jaunt.
So where are we?
Harmony Falls, Oregon.
What the hell is Savage doing in Pleasantville?
Murder, apparently.
Reports are vague, but it seems like the killer is an expert with knives.
That sounds like Savage's MO.
Yeah, well, clearly we have to assume that Savage has a larger, more nefarious plan.
Savage is pretty good at hiding, even in a small town, so how do you plan to find him?
By investigating these murders.
Now, there has to be a common link between the victims, starting with the first.
A piano teacher was found slain in her home, which is now on the market.
There's a small room above the garage, suitable for live-in help.
You know, I have a lovely Tudor style in another town.
It's a very impressive facility.
I did my doctoral thesis on socio-pathology in relationship to serial murder, actually.
Well, that'll certainly come in handy around here.
Of course, I could never consider accepting a position here without my faithful nurse/assistant.
Yes, well, she looks like she'll fit right in.
Meanwhile, Jefferson is the perfect age to discern the facts behind the disappearance of three teenagers who went missing a week before these murders began.
We are here to investigate the serial murders which have plagued this sleepy old town of yours.
Or we can come back with a court order and a really nasty disposition.
Anything for our friends at the bureau.
Nice work, partner.
You're not my partner.
There's only one person I ever trusted on this job, and we all know how that turned out.
Seeing white picket fences and perfect family houses, it's enough to make one nostalgic.
Dude, even if this town wasn't full of small-minded idiots, it'd still be creepy as hell.
I used to watch all these old horror movies with my mom, and they all started off in places like this.
See, first it's all perfect, and then, boom, some alien monster beast thing starts killing kids on Lovers' Lane.
What is it?
Perhaps she can illuminate us as to their whereabouts.
Hey, Jax, why don't you just go do that?
Come along, Nurse.
Hey, you mind if I sit?
Well, now that we're done moving in, care to dance?
So yesterday we kissed, and now today we're married.
Okay, I know it seems like we're moving fast, but this is all pretend.
Soon as we get a divorce, we'll figure us out.
In the meantime, doesn't mean we can't have fun with it.
I'd like to think that in a town with multiple murders and missing teenagers, the local insane asylum would be fertile ground for clues.
Let's start by reviewing the files of every inmate with a history of violence.
If you wouldn't mind getting me those files, Nurse?
Literally for days.
Is that a new perfume I smell?
I'm very busy right now.
Well, maybe next time, he'll take no for an answer.
I'm... not really looking for a husband.
The files you asked for, Doctor.
Excellent, Nurse.
I could also go for a cup of coffee.
Oh, that's Hall H, the restricted ward.
Thank you so much, Miss...
Mrs. Knox.
Gail Knox, and this is my husband, Curtis.
Lovely to meet you.
I'm sorry, have... have we met before?
I-I doubt it.
I... we just moved in from way out of town.
Well, another reason why we dropped by was to let you know that we are having a soiree tonight.
It's that kind of neighborhood.
Savage doesn't think I recognize him, which means he won't try to kill me.
He can't steal my powers before I've found them.
Don't forget, we also have to figure out why he's killing the townsfolk.
Are you really eating that?
Yes, well, Mr. Snart and I have been analyzing these forensic files.
Hmm, something you both have in common.
Are we just gonna pretend like none of this happened?
That Mick Rory wasn't a part of our team?
Right now, we need to stay focused on the mission.
Look, Savage is going to be busy with this little cocktail party.
If you're looking for booze, you're in the wrong office.
Then I suggest you find a waitress.
Well, I-I just assumed...
You assumed wrong.
So why don't you go ahead and get your own champagne?
Wow, I guess this whole interracial marriage thing really is a novelty.
Okay, we need to split up.
You check the back rooms, and I'll see what I can find up here.
Uh, you sure that's a good idea?
Leaving you up here by yourself with Savage?
I'm pretty sure he's not gonna kill me next to the canapés, Ray.
Me, I've never left Harmony Falls.
Wow, you do not hold back.
Well, it is around here.
Well, good thing I'm not from around here.
Uh, Nurse Lance, may I have a word with you, please?
Get to Hall H!
Your husband must be a fool to leave a woman such as yourself alone at a party.
Do you believe in fate?
Enjoy the party.
I've allowed you and your cohorts the occasional freedom to run free and to feed your thirst, and then... then you do something like this.
Oh, it's a room in a basement where a dude goes to be alone or watch football.
In Savage's case, it's kill people.
I got a date tonight with Tommy Fuller's cheerleader girlfriend.
Turns out Betty's boyfriend was one of the missing high school kids.
I think she knows more than she's letting on.
Mm, she's also a white girl in a very, uh, unenlightened community.
So please, be careful when you're out in public with her.
How's it going over there?
You need to get out of there!
Don't you ever get freaked out?
I mean, being in an insane asylum by yourself in the middle of the night?
Freaked out?
Actually, there is one place in the hospital that scares me.
Dr. Knox's restricted wing.
Do you know what he's doing to the patients down there?
What do you like to think about?
Girls from 1958?
Those guys back at the soda shop, they mentioned something about your boyfriend going AWOL?
It's kind of a long story.
Well, I got all the time in the world.
We were drag racing down on Route 7 with Davis and Billy when Tommy's car went into a ditch.
Hey, get the hell off me, man!
Who's Gideon?
Uh, a doctor, of sorts.
You need to pull over, Jax.
What were you doing with this girl on Lovers' Lane, boy?
There are kids back there that could really use your help, and she needs medical attention right now.
Gideon traced Jax's last biosignature to this location.
Well, it seems you had good reason to be concerned for Mr. Jackson's safety.
Yeah, sucks being right all the time.
Where is Jefferson?
There was no sign of him in the car.
These wounds don't appear consistent with a knife.
Captain, analysis of Miss Seavers' blood reveals traces of silicate minerals.
Miss Seavers, do you recall Tommy coming into contact with a meteor of some kind?
The car crash... it was... it was glowing.
She's talking about an Nth Metal meteorite.
Say something that makes sense.
It seems Mr. Fuller has come into contact with a meteorite with mutagenic properties.
Try again.
Apparently, Miss Seavers' boyfriend has been exposed to the same type of meteor that Kendra came into contact with.
And I'm guessing it's not curable.
Okay, so if Savage isn't the one doing the killing, what is he doing in town?
Then he'll kill you.
Yes, and the team seems comfortable with me doing this, so that makes it about you and me.
- Any updates?
- We're making progress.
Another opportunity for you to see Nurse Carlisle.
Yeah, and apologize.
That's the thing that sucks about feelings is, you realize how much you can hurt someone or... get hurt.
This young man and I have a lot to discuss.
Well, I'll take racist over crazy any day.
Oh, I would hardly describe what I'm doing here as... as "crazy."
Therapy is nothing more than a process of self-discovery.
You're about to experience an extraterrestrial power.
But sadly, the effect of this meteorite turned out quite different.
But no less advantageous.
Doc, you have a visitor.
What a pleasant surprise.
Is it a surprise... or fate?
We didn't get to finish our discussion the other night.
What of your square-jawed husband, Raymond?
Make yourself comfortable.
Nurse?
Nurse, I keep hearing voices in my head.
My wife with another man, and it's driving me crazy.
Well, maybe you should learn to trust your wife a little bit more.
And don't hesitate to give him a sedative if he doesn't calm down.
Right away, Nurse.
I'm sure the kid is fine.
I've grown so accustomed to our partnership, to suddenly be without him is disquieting.
I know the feeling.
I'm afraid you'll think me forward.
Oh, but you are forward.
Coming here in that dress?
Perhaps you should learn to embrace your desires so the two of us can finally be together.
Did you lose something?
You must think me stupid not to suspect that your powers had emerged.
I'm afraid both of you boys have some explaining to do down at the station.
I hope you're better at lying in your next life.
Oh, boy.
Just when you think you've seen everything.
Guess those missing kids are no longer missing.
I set out to build an army as powerful as you.
Pity they didn't turn out nearly as beautiful.
Perhaps it will turn out better in our next life, my love.
Are you okay?
It's time to go.
Gideon was able to help me devise a gene therapy that will hopefully restore Jefferson and those at the asylum to their former selves.
If genome bonding occurs, we should know right away.
Another minute, and things might have gone down very differently.
Despite your bravado, Mr. Snart, the actions that I witnessed last night were nothing short of heroic.
It's working.
And you?
Not sure if I'm ever gonna get fully back to normal.
Thank you... for rescuing me.
Well, you rescued me first, so now we're even.
I get it.
Should've known better than to fall for a ninja.
I wish you didn't have to go.
Maybe we'll catch up down the road somewhere.
And you will end Savage someday.
I guess the last thing a 4,000-year-old demigoddess needs is an overprotective husband.
Partner.
Grey told me about what happened back at the asylum.
You had the chance to kill me, and you didn't.
Agreed... we're still waiting on Sara and the two lovebirds to get back.
Seems they've taken quite a shine to 1958.
What on earth?
Clearly, he's received some new toys from his Time Master friends since our last encounter.
Gideon, seal the bulkheads from here until...
If we merge on the Waverider, we could destroy the entire ship!
Um, are you not paying attention to what Chronos is doing?
This Cup is the one chance I have at getting my mom back.
- What's happening?
- Looks like someone's trying to break in.
Oh, my God, Simon!
The Clave has ordered me to take temporary control of this Institute.
- That's just it.
He won't return alive or breathing.
I've done everything for my parents...
Maybe you should start living for yourself.
- What do you want?
- I want my property back.
Lydia Branwell... will you marry me, Alec Lightwood?
I'm nothing more than a monster.
What did I do?
I can see my reflection, does that mean I'm not... not... one of you?
This can't be happening.
I'm the monster.
Look, you gotta get this under control.
You are what you are now.
We'll get you back to the Hotel DuMort.
You said you'd look after him.
It means he's where everybody goes when this happens.
If it helps, he doesn't even remember it was you.
Those first minutes... a complete blank.
But I have to tell him the truth.
Once you rein him in, he'll be walking, talking proof to the Clave that Camille broke the Accords.
Give me a call when he turns up.
He'll need my help.
I think we've had just about enough of your help.
What are you doing?
Don't squirm.
No talking... just healing.
There's been an attack at the Institute.
Jace, it went after Hodge and Alec.
Valentine attacked my home.
Clary, you're right, okay?
Don't get used to it.
Look, maybe Luke can help you find Simon.
Werewolves are really great trackers.
Excellent talk.
Are the wards solid now?
Even my magic has limits.
Extra time is priceless.
No... say that after you get my bill.
A Forsaken wound often needs a little warlock TLC.
It's okay.
I'm fine.
And I should find this Lydia person.
Payment upfront is just smart business.
Meliorn?
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm not here to talk about us.
I believe that's your Clave envoy.
Isabelle, please step aside.
Meliorn, the Clave has ordered that you be placed under arrest.
- Have you lost your mind?
And you told him nothing in return?
Valentine has been murdering Downworlders and draining their bodies for months.
He probably killed those Seelie scouts and used their blood...
Simon is gonna hate me.
Luke, I did a terrible thing.
It can't be undone.
I found my way back, your mother helped me.
She calls Meliorn in and arrests him, then acts like it's all out of her hands.
I'm fine, Izzy.
It was the Clave that gave the order, not Lydia.
Well, maybe they aren't.
The Institute was under their control when the Forsaken got in.
What are you talking about?
That's because they made a deal with the Clave prior to the Uprising.
In exchange for their cooperation, they were pardoned.
You're questioning their loyalty?
Valentine is back.
The Circle is rising.
I know what kind of people they are.
Are you sure?
They're hypocrites.
Tell us what?
Lydia and I are engaged.
You're not serious.
Not sure what to say.
How about, "None of this matters"?
We have to stop Valentine.
Simon, is that you?
Oh, thank God.
Mom.
You can't worry me like that.
Clary said you were okay, but I just kept picturing you dead in a ditch somewhere.
I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you.
Please, just call me next time and let me know.
Doesn't he look so pale to you?
Mom... there's something I need to...
You won't believe this, but my identity was stolen.
Bank account hacked.
Apparently, I am not Clary Fray.
Clary, I don't think he's well enough to go...
Simon, we have always been here for each other.
I don't know.
Are you sure, baby?
You know how much of a hypochondriac I can be.
You know how much he means to me.
Okay, we should really go.
I'll see you later, Mom.
I'm holding you to that.
And when you come home, you and I are gonna have a serious discussion about what's going on with you.
I need a word with you, now.
Were you planning on telling us about your engagement before we left for Idris?
I'm marrying Lydia, and now you know.
I think you misunderstood your mother's suggestion that you marry.
We wanted someone who would help this family, not destroy it.
You know?
What did you think, I'd never find out?
All these years, you never said anything.
We couldn't.
Is that the best you can do?
You drilled into me that I was never good enough.
It wasn't that.
We wanted you to be better than we were.
You wanted to sweep history under the rug.
You wanted us to save you, restore the Lightwood name.
Alec, you're making a mistake.
No, I'm gonna fix what you broke.
And I'm gonna do it on my terms.
I feel sick.
Don't worry, we'll get you what you need.
I need this to stop.
What if I do that to you?
Simon, it was my choice.
You died.
I could stake your heart or I could... bury you, and you could come back.
Clary, why?
Because I love you, Simon.
You call that love?
You brought me back to this?
This nothing... where I feed, and I have to hide from the sun, and I can't bear to be by the people that I love?
Simon, please understand...
Just stay away from me.
Yeah, well, enjoy Portaling back to Idris with Mom and Dad.
Meliorn is here because of me.
Alec's right.
There's nothing we can do to stop this interrogation.
You're on Alec's side now?
We swore to protect each other, of course he's on my side.
We have got to find Valentine.
Let's let this play out, Izzy.
Meliorn might have some important information.
Forensics don't lie.
Tell me what you know about the blood in the Forsaken.
Have you considered that the blood in the Forsaken came from our dead scouts?
Scouts sent to help you hunt for Valentine.
Why do you think we would side with a murderer?
Seelies always play both sides.
You should talk to your own people about playing sides.
Excuse me?
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Still think we should let this play out?
I'm pretty sure that's not the cup you're looking for.
Alec, call this off now.
What is going on with you?
Look, Jace, we have to turn over the Cup.
Alec, she's risked everything to find it.
And we've risked everything for her.
Just drink.
You can do it, Simon.
It's a Blocking rune.
It prevents anyone from finding you using Shadowhunter tracking.
You'll see, it'll get better.
Clary, the Clave heard you had the Cup.
I'll find you.
They'll look there first.
Simon, we're going to see the one person who can help us both.
Have you lost your mind?
A Shadowhunter and a werewolf?
You do know this isn't a hotel?
Technically, it is.
Even starvation can't shut you up.
You should put a muzzle on that mutt.
The fledgling can stay.
Look, there isn't any place else.
What good will he be if he dies of starvation?
Fine, but the stray waits outside.
They'll be under my protection.
Where are you taking him?
To a holding cell.
The Clave made the order.
That could be a death sentence to a Downworlder.
Seelies often skirt the truth.
If he has information on another terrorist attack, it is our responsibility to get it.
Let me talk to him.
That wasn't exactly helpful in the past.
But he may not know anything.
Alec, this is going too far.
We don't have a choice.
And neither do we.
Without his knowledge.
Magnus, ever since Alec found out our parents were in the Circle, he's been messed up.
He can't see the big picture.
If the Clave is willing to subject Meliorn to the Silent Brothers, if they're willing to go this far... what do you think will happen if they get the Cup?
This affects everyone.
Gold, rubies... definitely diamonds.
And Alec can never know.
That's a given.
So this is your idea of protection?
It keeps you away from my people, and my people away from you.
Give a shout when you're hungry.
Of course, you do have a pretty decent snack right here, no?
Oh, silly me.
I forgot... you two are such great friends.
Or has that changed?
Clary... you do not understand how this is.
I can hear your heartbeat.
I can smell the blood in your veins.
And I want it.
Maybe what I did was wrong and selfish, but... my heart was breaking.
Simon, when it comes to you, I am still just Clary Fray.
And you are still my best friend.
It's all about presentation and quality produce.
You see, us vampires look after one another.
We take care of our family.
Simon already has a family.
Had a family.
That's all gonna change now.
You're a Shadowhunter... he's a vamp.
You two will never be equals.
You'll have to learn that for yourself.
Not bad for a day's work.
I thought I'd see how you were doing.
I meant to thank you for your advice.
The whole... "follow your heart" thing.
Oh, well, what can I say?
I have a deep understanding of the human psyche.
At least, that's what Freud always said.
I mean, we should at least go to dinner first...
No, Magnus, family is everything to me.
Yeah, I am.
That's why I proposed to Lydia.
That's... interesting.
It makes sense.
It's a solid partnership.
For both of us.
"Solid partnership."
That's hot!
Congratulations.
Marriage is a wonderful institution.
Not that I would know.
Goodbye, Alexander.
You might wanna pick up the pace.
You do not wanna be on my bad side right now.
Are you gonna be okay?
The whole world is turning upside down.
Simon turned into a vampire.
They just put a bunch of unrelated facts together, and came up with a big lie.
I wish that made me feel better.
Where do you think you're going?
She could be in serious danger.
Well, in that case, I'd make a timely exit before anyone of importance notices you're gone.
We won't forget this.
Do you think I'd be sending Meliorn to the Silent Brothers if I thought there was another way?
You heard about my fiance... how he died.
Yeah, it was a demon attack in Rio.
They never released the details.
We'd gotten intel about a demon threat at Carnival.
The demons were reportedly at this club in the favela.
But we had no idea how many there were.
We got word of a warlock on their payroll, so... we brought him in.
My team wanted to make him talk.
You made a judgment call.
It was the wrong call.
We went in blind.
And there had to have been 100 demons.
If only I just had the guts to do what needed to be done.
I can't make that mistake again.
How are you feeling now?
I'm drinking blood, Clary.
I know, Simon, but...
I never wanted any part of any of this.
At least you're a superior being.
I'm a Downworlder.
Well, that's good.
Simon, what if I brought you back because I wanted us both to be different?
I mean, suddenly I was this new person, and... you were still living in our old world.
Look, I understand if you hate me now.
Hate you?
Never.
What's gonna happen to us?
Luke and Raphael can't stand each other.
Every Downworlder seems to despise Shadowhunters.
Can't you see the divide?
Never.
It appears the cavalry has arrived.
You'll wanna use the back stairs.
Can we please focus on the matter at hand?
- They think Meliorn has more information on Valentine and the attack than he's saying.
We get him from the guards, in and out, no one gets hurt.
You want us to go up against the Silent Brothers, and an elite Shadowhunter guard unit?
- Without any backup?
If they're doing this to Seelies, no Downworlder is safe.
But we can't go in alone, not if we don't want to be detected.
My pack will track the unit, create a distraction.
As much as I hate to agree with Simon, vamps aren't exactly team players.
Let me talk to Raphael.
I think I can persuade him.
We're offering an alliance with the Seelies.
And the werewolves.
Why should we believe you?
- Look... you were just following Camille's orders.
She violated the Accords.
You are a different kind of leader.
We are a new generation of Shadowhunters.
We believe everyone can be equal.
What do you say?
This decision requires a consensus.
I vote yes.
Well, well, well, baby's first words.
Don't make me regret them.
If our newest member pledges his loyalty to his new leader and joins our clan... we'll all stand beside you.
Whatever it takes to protect the Downworld.
It's my world now.
Then we're in.
This does not look like the City of Bones.
This is the Downworlders entrance.
I hope I have better luck here than I did last time.
I'm just saying.
Everyone knows what to do?
Text when you're in position.
Stay.
It's time we put aside our differences, and work together!
Tonight we're all Downworlders.
I guess I should expect people to hate me for who I am now.
Let's do this.
We're risking everything, aren't we?
Going against the Clave, against the other Shadowhunters...
Valentine's trying to destroy the world, Clary.
We're trying to protect it.
Did Alec give you these?
Thank you.
So what are we thinking?
A little encanto action?
Just watch and learn from the master.
Remember... no one gets hurt.
Come here.
Damn it.
Just say the word, and we'll call the whole thing off.
No, there's no turning back now.
So whatever happens, follow my lead.
This could be a trap.
I'll take Meliorn inside.
Just stay here.
Nobody gets through.
I did what needed to be done.
Alec, the Clave has gone too far.
You couldn't possibly understand...
I'm really sorry.
Clary, Meliorn, go, now.
You always broke the rules, but never the law, not until she showed up.
You've had it out for Clary from the start.
And now you're getting married, Alec?
I don't wanna be alive if we're on different sides, Alec.
Come with me.
We'll fight Valentine the right way... together.
If we do that... we'll be considered traitors like Mom and Dad.
I'm begging you, my parabatai... my brother.
Clary, we have to go.
Meliorn is a wanted man, we have to get him back to the Seelie court where he's protected.
I wish you could come with us.
We'll see each other soon.
Simon, listen, I...
Maybe that's supposed to mean something, but you're still you.
Sort of.
Let's work up to hugging... because I haven't had dinner yet.
I underestimated you.
Is that a thank you?
I hate to break up this reunion, Izzy, but we have to go.
You're in good hands.
I need to get back to the Institute, see what hell has broken loose.
Try and talk some sense into Alec.
Take care of him.
Isabelle told me it was your idea to rally the Downworlders.
That you spearheaded my rescue.
Don't give me too much credit.
You're a Shadowhunter now.
I've been surprised by more than one Shadowhunter tonight.
You risked everything to unite us.
Which is why I'm offering you a gift... for your sacrifice.
In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child.
I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power.
In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...
The flashes I've been having... they're of Carter.
2166.
We have, quite literally, run out of time.
I don't believe there are any safe places, Captain.
- Why's London shooting at us?
Maybe picking up here wasn't the brightest idea.
Captain, I've managed to slip beneath their artillery fire.
Set us down on the outskirts of the city, Gideon, near the encampment of the remaining resistance forces.
We really don't have the time, Martin.
There's no way we can grab him here.
Not with an army standing between us.
Onward to victory!
Onward to immortality!
Savage's lady friend just made us.
Have faith, Mr. Snart.
Gideon, push in on the woman.
That bracelet she's wearing... can you get a clearer image?
Oh, my God.
If we don't move real soon, we could get ourselves killed.
Sara, the woman you're fighting... you need to take her bracelet.
Are you seriously jewelry shopping right now?
We're outnumbered.
Mr. Jackson, now would be a good time to pick us up.
What exactly do you think you were doing back there?
Distracting Savage's pals, which worked, by the way.
Yes, well, I could've been killed.
That's great.
And that's sweet, but there's still one small problem.
It's a bracelet; how are you supposed to kill Savage with it?
A question we will answer the moment we have obtained it.
We need our resident kleptomaniacs to steal that bracelet.
Captain, I've detected movement 300 meters southwest of our position and closing.
I believe they are all that remains of the resistance forces.
It wasn't rhetorical.
Thank you, gentlemen, for accompanying me on this excursion.
What if, instead of encountering these resistance fighters, we meet up with more of Savage's forces?
My wife and son live in Whitechapel.
The same fate will befall you if you don't accept our help.
How do we know you're not with Savage?
Because if we were, you'd be dead right now.
Look, feel free to shoot us, but from the looks of it, you could use all the allies you can get.
You think your wife and son are among them?
Uh, I would've brought more, but...
We'll be back.
So what did you mean back there, about your family?
I'd rather not discuss it.
Yeah, I picked up on that.
I also picked up on the fact that we're in London just a few days before Savage tries to kill your wife and son, and you're not trying to get them to safety.
After my first attempt on Savage in Ancient Egypt, my very next stop was here in 2166.
I found Miranda and Jonas exactly where I'd left them, and we... we raced towards the Waverider, but we had a run-in with Savage's shocktroopers.
Miranda and Jonas were cut down.
So I jumped even further back, and the outcome was exactly the same.
Funny feeling knowing that the universe itself doesn't want you to save your family.
There's no record of you anywhere, and you and your friends disappeared 150 years ago.
No one gets close to Savage, especially not now.
Some idiots made an attempt on his life earlier tonight.
He's gone to ground in the citadel's bunker and he's holed up good and tight.
We need air support.
Where's Delta Camp?
Establish a perimeter!
Once it's secure, we'll search for survivors.
Last week, Savage's forces laid waste to Tokyo.
London is the last patch of free ground on the planet.
Savage's armies have cut down the most formidable militaries in the world.
What do you men think you can do against an evil like this?
There were no survivors from the attack.
No, whatever weapon Savage used against the rebels was quite effective.
Maybe Professor Stein and I should survey the wreckage, analyze some soil samples, determine what kind of weaponry Savage is using.
Do we have a plan for stealing this bracelet?
We're on it.
Please don't tell me the plan is to walk into Savage's citadel and steal it off her wrist.
All right, I won't tell you that.
All right, well, we still have the issue of how to turn a piece of jewelry into a lethal weapon.
Perhaps there is reference to the bracelet in Professor Boardman's diary.
Savage has devastating weapon at his command, and here now, at the eleventh hour, we could sorely use a weapon of our own.
This is such a waste of time.
I've already looked through every single page of Aldus' notebooks.
If he had written something specific about the bracelet and killing Savage, I would have known it already.
Here it is.
You ever think about him?
Carter?
Not in this lifetime, anyway.
- I'll give you one guess.
- Our anniversary?
Look, I'm sorry, but in my defense, there's quite a few of them to remember.
I think it's time you learn how to use it.
But it's your weapon.
Savage has murdered us countless times, and we aren't always lucky enough to die together.
This is awfully depressing talk for our anniversary, don't you think?
Kendra, this is important.
I need to know that if I go first, you have everything you need to face him.
I don't want to think about facing Savage... or life... without you.
Who's to say I'll ever be strong enough to kill Savage by myself?
What is it?
I think I know what we can use to kill Savage.
Savage has warned you all about the radicals who oppose us.
They will not show you the mercy I just did.
Dismissed.
I said you're dismissed.
Oh, we thought you said "missed."
Whoever you are, you're certainly persistent.
What now, Mr. Snart?
How do you know my name?
There I was, thinking we could go a whole week without kidnapping anyone.
I think you'll find it would have been better to simply kill me.
I agree.
I know who all of you are.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Gareeb.
I see Savage has been rather chatty with his lieutenants.
If you think I am merely Savage's soldier, you're more idiotic than he claimed.
Vandal Savage has a daughter?
And this lid is gonna be very upset when he finds out that we took his pot.
It's not like we're on Savage's Christmas card list.
We need to weaponize that thing before Savage knows that it and his daughter are missing.
We also need to figure out what we're going to do with our new guest.
She's seen us and the ship.
If she runs back to Savage, we're giving him a huge advantage.
I'd rather maintain my life, Professor.
If she is Savage's daughter, then she would know the details of his defenses.
Yes, well, how exactly are we going to get those details out of her?
I'm on it.
I'm the daughter of Vandal Savage, the immortal ruler of the world.
Do you think he hasn't prepared me for this?
Do you think I haven't already been taught to endure the most extreme suffering?
You know, your father sounds a lot like mine.
He unleashed the Armageddon Virus in order to conquer the globe.
It tore through the world like a fire.
Millions died, including my mother.
No one dared to stand up to Degaton, except for my father.
He may not be a kind man, but he is the only one capable of putting this world back together.
So you can torture me if you like.
My suffering's a small price to pay.
Who said anything about torture?
What's your point?
You sure you can look Savage in the eye and kill him?
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like the last guy who swung that thing.
Savage's superweapon isn't an explosive.
The exact conclusion I've just come to after examining soil samples from the attack site.
How did you determine it?
Gideon... she found a defunct spy satellite.
And here is the camp, destroyed.
What am I supposed to be seeing?
They're footprints.
Sir, we've located the rebels responsible for your daughter's abduction.
The Leviathan is two clicks from their encampment.
He's coming for me.
Yeah, you and a bunch of innocent refugees.
If they were innocent, they wouldn't have rebelled against my father.
Whatever it is, it's getting closer.
Well, we're a little short on weapons.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Saving a township, by the looks of it.
Since when did my vessel become a life raft?
Since I decided we can't leave these people here to be slaughtered.
Gideon, power the engines and get us into the air the moment the last refugee is aboard.
And get the weapons system online.
What's happening?
It would seem Savage has come back for his baby girl.
Gideon, external floodlights to maximum.
- That's...
- Incredible.
Hold on to something!
Now might be a good time to start praying.
- Gideon, what's our status?
- I'm gonna go with "lousy."
What happened?
I estimate the robot should reach our location within the hour.
Our propulsion engine was severely damaged in the crash and is no longer functioning.
So where does that leave us?
All right, our only option is to take the Jumpship and try and outrun it.
I've administered a mild sedative.
He should be comfortable.
Which is more than can be said for the rest of us.
He's just doing what he must to save his daughter.
What a charming euphemism for interrogation.
"My dad may not be perfect, but deep down, he's not a bad guy."
You don't know my father at all if you think his daughter could be so easily manipulated.
Just trying to show you the truth.
The truth is, my father was trying to save me.
From what, untrained civilians with barely any weapons?
Your father sent a 200-foot robot to level a bunch of tents.
The people in that camp were rebels, dangerous radicals.
Look, took me a long time to accept my old man was a monster.
I'm betting you're smarter than I am.
At last, something we agree on.
Oh, Per Degaton didn't release the Armageddon Virus.
That was your father.
Your father, however...
What makes you think I'd believe anything you tell me?
Because seeing is believing.
The world's population is unsustainable at current levels.
The herd must be thinned.
This isn't true.
You're a liar.
And you know it... deep down.
How are repairs coming?
Not in 30 minutes, which is about as much time as we have.
We brought all those people on board, and all we've bought them is an extra few minutes to live in fear.
Well, I guess the question is, what do we do with those minutes?
The ship is crippled!
Everyone aboard is as dead as my...
And my new bestie and I can get us in.
And I think I've got a way to stop the giant robot that's coming to kill us.
Now, you may not believe in fate, Raymond, but I certainly do.
And perhaps it was fate that compelled me to bring you seven together so we can change this future once and for all.
I can't believe this is our life.
Well, take him out, and it won't be.
You can do this.
- Ray, if anything...
Sounds like it's getting closer.
It's not that nutso when you consider the theoretical possibility that siphoning power from the auxiliary time drive should provide enough power to reverse the polarity of the dwarf star matrix.
Sorry, Ray, I'm falling asleep back here, man.
You know, if this doesn't work...
I'll turn every cell in my body inside out?
I was gonna go with "die," but yeah.
You know, we could've escaped on the Jumpship, but we're doing this to save everybody that we brought on the Waverider.
The Leviathan is encountering resistance.
Impossible.
Dr. Palmer.
Clever.
I've been so worried.
How did you...
I am your daughter.
These are the time travelers I warned you of.
Father?
Like you fooled me?
Let me go.
Call them.
Call the ones that you no doubt helped gain access to my bunker.
No need to trouble yourself, Miss Savage.
We're already here.
Oh, I admire your command of irony, Gareeb...
Using my own child against me.
Sorry to say it didn't take much.
None at all, you ass.
Do not speak as if you know anything about ruling a people.
Do you really want to align your fate with these... pretenders?
They're nothing but grains of sand in the desert of time.
You are a monster.
Actually, they're compressed light beams.
Well, whatever they're called, just hit him with them.
You do realize that she can do me no harm?
Sure, you did.
He doesn't even remember who he was... and he never will.
What?
But do so knowing that I am the only one holding the key to his mind.
You got to choose to get up and fight.
You got to choose to live.
Finish him!
Destroy me, and you doom him.
If I kill Savage, his mind will be lost.
And if you don't, I will lose my wife and son.
Well, my love, what's it gonna be, huh?
Because she's an asset to the cause.
My father may be incapacitated, but his forces are still strong.
I know their tactics, their weaknesses.
Why the change of heart?
Ask him.
Is everything okay?
Ray, we need to talk.
Every one of them is alive and well.
But for how long?
Apparently, time wants to happen.
Oh, I think you'll find that time... for once... is on our side.
Well, you seem quite happy for a man behind bars.
Why shouldn't I be happy?
It seems that you once again have failed to kill me.
Providence has allowed me to place Chay-Ara in an impossible situation:
a choice between her own soul mate, Carter... and yours.
I see.
So you still think there's hope, then... for your family.
Time will tell, Captain.
Time will tell.
This season on "Legends of Tomorrow"...
I've assembled you all because I need your help.
The future of the world is in peril because of Vandal Savage.
You've turned your back on the very institution you were meant to serve.
Shut it down!
There are no strings on me.
What are we doing back here?
Savage has a timeship, courtesy of the Time Masters.
The timeline is unclear, due to our destruction of the Oculus, meaning Savage is lost to history.
Which is why I brought you all home.
- Mission's not over, man.
Great, so what you're saying is for the last five months, my mom probably thinks that I'm dead.
In truth, I never left it.
I'm sorry for all that I've asked of you, and that it all came to nothing.
I never liked that guy.
- I just got back.
I-I thought we should talk.
Well you didn't waste any time getting back to your old habits.
Did you ever think that maybe you weren't meant to do this anymore?
What are you doing with your hand?
Maybe he wanted us to, you know, be partners.
While doing what?
What was H.G. Wells' childhood nickname?
You've gotten every answer correct tonight.
Since when did you become such a history buff?
I guess I developed a passion for it recently.
During your sabbatical?
That's what I've been trying to tell Mick.
Boring.
When do we get in contact with Hunter?
Ms. Lance, are you all right?
How do we get the Waverider back here?
No, but we have received a transmission from 2016 Star City.
Can you reach the Waverider or not?
We're working on it.
Actually, guys, I think it just worked.
I thought I made my intentions perfectly clear.
Yeah, just curious how much headway you've had tracking Savage without all of us.
No, worse.
I'm sorry, my love, but this game is not over yet.
You knew that Laurel was going to die, and now you're going to take me back, and I'm going to save my sister.
- I'm afraid that that...
- You should be afraid.
I can't allow you...
Look, Sara, I'm sure there's a valid reason why Rip didn't...
Stay out of this!
What the hell, Rip?
Mr. Rory, take Ms. Lance to sleep it off.
Oh, well that narrows it down a lot.
Sorry.
- Did you?
- Dude, it's just a helmet.
Temporal changes can, on occasion, reverberate through the timeline, physically moving an object from one place to another.
Why then?
Because that's where Kendra is.
Oh, he might be a little disoriented, after the way he came out of stasis.
- I know you.
- Oh, you remember her?
I'm going to kill you.
You've had 4,000 years to do so, with no success.
They sent three meteorites containing technology beyond human understanding.
I will be a god.
Please try very hard not to kill me.
And you know that I would do this for you, Sara, but I just can't.
When we left, when I recruited you, we... we... we altered the timeline.
I'm so sorry.
You are one of the strongest people I have ever met, Sara.
Captain, we are prepared to make the time jump to 1944.
We're on our way, Gideon.
Gideon has detected a temporal signature consistent with a timeship.
Is he still nuts?
No, he's okay.
What the hell was that?
Okay, let's get out of here.
Kendra's down.
- So this is a spaceship?
- It's a timeship, but yes, it does also travel through space.
You... you've seen it before, Mr. Hall.
Perhaps we can start with what Savage was doing in 1944.
- Thanagarian...
- The Thanagarians were race of extraterrestrials.
He also said that this technology was actually three meteors.
It's a similar process by which our uniform materializes when we merge, but at the moment, we need to focus on figuring out what Savage is planning.
Come on, just the once.
Is that Raymond and Kendra's lucky vase?
I don't know, I just found this junk lying around.
You need to focus, Jefferson.
Why do you always say it like I'm not focusing?
Just do what you did before.
What?
I-I think I know what Savage is planning to do.
How can you destroy the world three times in three different times?
You can't, it would create a temporal paradox.
This is the craziest bad guy plan in the history of bad guy plans.
I don't think that sanity is a yardstick by which Vandal Savage can be measured.
Okay, so which time periods are we talking here?
You said Savage was in possession of one of these meteorites in 1958.
That was a year of a rare alignment, with the Earth and Thanagar.
Evidently he got hold of a second meteorite in 1944.
Which would be useless to him in a year where Earth and Thanagar weren't in alignment.
Now, if my math is correct, and trust me, it is, the next two years that Earth and Thanagar are in sync are 1975 and 2021.
But Savage still has to do this in three different time periods.
That's the beauty of immortality, Jefferson: he can.
He can literally be in three places at once.
You're out here tonight, because you have felt an immanent presence of... something.
Change the course of the entire world.
One in 1958, one in 1975, and one in 2021.
Open it.
Did you know that this is one of the original meteorites which fell upon the Middle Kingdom?
Drawn from the ground after a millennia, straight into Nazi hands.
The object that has bound the two of us together for 4,000 years has the power to take us back to where it all began.
Patience, Mr. Hall.
All our teams need to act simultaneously.
I think that's a comet or something.
It's a meteorite, in point of fact.
I was drawn to it as well.
Um, we got a nuclear bomb, here.
Professor, Jax, we need you.
Oh, man, I forgot how much of a badass I was.
Look.
What do you mean you don't have the money?
- You expect me to just hand the meteor over for free?
Now.
Glad we're past the point of worrying about the timeline.
Time Master's never late.
Guess you haven't heard the news.
Come on, Gray!
We did it, man.
Gideon, take us back to Rip.
Damn it!
I'm on it.
On what?
I guess this is good-bye.
It's been a pleasure, Captain.
Likewise, Dr. Palmer.
But you brought us all into this, man.
Which is why I'm doing this alone, Mr. Jackson.
I'll have no one else die for my choices.
This isn't going to bring Snart back.
I don't want to lose another friend.
I appreciate that, Mr. Rory.
I must say, it's been an honor to serve as your cap...
Daddy?
I'm still here, Captain.
I know you are, Gideon.
May I share something with you?
Me neither.
Transfer all available power to the time drive.
Get ready to eject the meteor, and pray that we have enough power for one last jump.
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Will somebody please tell me what just happened?
Well, I angled the ship to eject the meteorite before impact, and then, uh... time jumped away.
How does that work?
Someone needs to be responsible for protecting the timeline.
I should stay and help you with Darhk.
And get justice for Laurel.
Uh, listen, I-I can't pretend to understand this time travel thing, but it sounds important.
And now I'm going to do this for her.
Well, she'd be proud of you.
How do you know?
Now about this new sabbatical.
I decided to decline the invitation.
Yeah, you could kind of call it that.
Listen, Gray, you're meant for more than sitting around answering trivia questions about history.
You really want me to do this?
I could never forgive myself if I kept you from it, my husband the superhero.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I just wanted to talk.
You and I, we've done a lot of thieving, a lot of cool stuff, a lot of fun.
This wasn't a good idea.
You got that?
Yeah, I got it.
See you around.
You okay?
Fine.
If it's any consolation, I can always bring you back to this particular time and place.
A full compliment.
To be honest, I had my doubts that all of you would be willing to throw in with me for a second go.
- Well, actually...
- We're not coming with you.
With Savage gone, we want to start fresh, see what happens.
I give it three months, tops.
Be safe.
See you guys around.
Every time they do that, I get hungry for chicken.
So, shall we?
Another Waverider?
Whatever it is, it's not slowing down.
Get down!
What the hell's going on?
To be honest, Mr. Jackson, I have absolutely no idea.
Is this 2016?
Is this May, 2016?
You're exactly where you said you'd be.
Do not get on that ship.
Says who?
Says you, Mr. Rory.
Previously on "Quantico"...
If you ever want to sit and talk.
Now's not a good time.
I'll expect your resignation in the morning.
Someday, everyone else will, too.
It's your job to stay out of my way, down in Operations.
You weren't the terrorist before, but now you're going to be.
Do not open it until I give you further instructions.
We've been trying to decode this terrorist's voice all night, and we still have nothing.
But we don't have time, Simon.
Whoever they are, they have all the security details of the candidates for next week's elections.
Because I'm here.
- Okay, so how do we derail their plan without them knowing?
I'll figure it out.
And I'll try to figure out who the voice behind our terrorist is.
First one of us that doesn't end up in jail or dead wins.
No more gallows humor, please.
I wasn't joking.
You're not dressed yet?
We have Defensive Tactics in five.
Well, you're not out yet, are you?
Nothing's official till Liam clears it with Miranda.
Ah, the old sock debacle.
Shelby, are we doing this or what?
You didn't come by after you got home last night.
How am I supposed to learn anything if you keep making it this easy?
Starting without me this morning.
You're a hard man to reach.
Well, that Verizon "you call a handler who leaves a message at a dead drop and I have to wait two hours before I can duck out and call back" plan... that's a real bitch.
It's nice to laugh.
Ah, I can hear it in your voice.
Sure seems like it these days.
I'm always here for you.
Wouldn't blow my cover if I had a drink with an old friend tonight.
I'd like us all to welcome Senator Claire Haas.
I asked Ms. Haas to be our enrichment speaker this morning because... we are going to discuss one of her cases.
Does anyone remember what happened on that day?
How about you, Perales?
And an hour after the game ended, five Giants fans got into a fight with four Patriots fans in the parking lot of a New Haven club.
And if I told you that the white male who was charged with stabbing and killing the black male had once belonged to a militia group?
What if I told you that he had married a black woman and had three beautiful children with her?
Confusing, isn't it?
It's the FBI's job to investigate and prosecute violent hate crimes.
But determining which violent offenses were motivated by bias is one of the toughest jobs the FBI has to do.
So, you are going to look at cases that were presented to the FBI for investigation.
And using the evidence on-hand, you will decide if this is a hate crime or merely violent offenses, all right?
You could have told me that you were coming to speak at enrichment.
Well, actually, I'm here to spy on you.
Lunch together when my tour is done?
You look like you're trying to do long division in your head.
Well, I guess I was just a little naive to think that Caleb and I still had a chance.
But he's not talking to me.
Settle something.
Caleb... into Shelby or not?
Her ever-changing emotional state directly affects my ability to get a good night's sleep.
So, what's the deal with Caleb?
What are you talking about?
He has an alter ego named Mark Raymond who wears different clothes, uses a different computer, and last night, one of them started sleeping with an envelope that he got from a woman at a diner.
Hey, sorry to interrupt your little moment here, but back in the pros, if they cut you, they did it fast.
Yeah, well, this ain't the pros.
Hi, Nimah.
I don't have time to talk right now.
Did you willingly send her to a potential terrorist cell knowing she hasn't finished her training, knowing the kind of person that she is?
Someone has to.
Raina, where are you?
Miranda, I'm at the cell house.
Everyone is gone, and they took the guns.
Do not open it until I give you further instructions.
Aren't you five floors above your pay grade, Parrish, or did you just come up to use our FedEx account?
I was actually looking for Ryan.
Well, if it's FBI business, you can talk to me.
If it's personal, you can do that on your own time, or you know, not at all, 'cause we have a pretty busy day up here.
The JTTF is giving the candidates their counterterrorism briefing for the campaign's final days, and you twisting the knife further into my ex-husband... it's not on the itinerary.
It's time to to open your package.
Now?
In the Senator's purse is an identical bottle.
You'll need to swap it out with the one you're holding.
What is it?
Why do you think I'd get anywhere close to her, anyway?
What are you gonna do to her?
Look, something has to tie into the plot that we're not seeing.
Raina, I need you to go to my house, bring Charlie here where he's safe.
So, you wanted my official resignation.
She did it on her own.
I only found out about it later.
Don't you get self-righteous with me.
Crossing the line with a trainee is not the same as putting one in danger.
I'm trying to stop whatever's happening.
Watch my classes until I figure out where the cell is headed.
Nimah, I'm talking to you.
Sorry, what was that?
If the victim says that he's not gay, then how could it be discrimination?
It's important to get to the core truth of a person.
He attacked a born-again Christian neighbor over a noise complaint.
Now, how do we prove his true motive was intolerance?
Probably because the FBI knew the guy's brother worked for a Congressman.
These are the FBI's own statistics on hate crimes.
She's a genius at mind jobs.
Well, think of how much it'll piss her off if we do this without her.
Who the FBI to decide what qualifies as a hate crime?
Why should they be the country's moral compass?
Liam kicking me out is proof the FBI is corrupt.
Oh, look who strolled back in.
Okay, if by "explain," you mean lie again, then no, I'm not gonna do that.
Instead, I'm gonna figure out what you're up to and how it connects to the senator.
'Cause right now, you're a little too close and a little too crazy for my comfort and the Secret Service's.
Please tell me you caught a break in this decryption process.
Just a few more hours.
You any closer to swapping out the Senator's pills?
Hannah's blocking me.
If you can't get to Claire, can you get her to come to you?
Time!
Those of you who answer correctly will be moving on to the next phase... building a bias profile against someone very important...
IDs, please.
Delivering a package.
Have you heard from Raina?
She's not responding to me.
She's on her way here now with Charlie.
You can wait for her here with me if you'd like.
I'm gonna need you to open up the back, too.
I think we need to talk about Caleb.
Caleb stole your money and met with a woman who gave him this.
I think they're related, but I don't know how.
Maybe you do.
Where did you get this?
Caleb had it.
What did you do?
I did what you were too much of a child to do.
I told her the truth.
IDs now, buddy.
We're on lock-down, ma'am... full crash.
There's been an incident at the guard station.
I need to let my First Responders Team know exactly what they're up against.
You sent Shelby out there.
You're the one who created the situation in the first place.
I'm sorry.
Which is why you're gonna distract him while I slip out.
Be careful, Caleb.
HRT is flooding the campus as we speak.
Whoever these radicals are, they don't stand a chance.
They're terrorists, okay?
I don't condone attacking anyone, but we can't just dismiss why they're doing it.
Who knows what the FBI might have done to create cause?
You see, Perales, this is exactly why you don't belong here.
Says the teacher who sleeps with his students.
Petty in a crisis.
That is a good look on you.
I know Charlie's involved.
I missed the signs.
I should have told my mom, you, the feds, anyone.
The cell you infiltrated... they didn't really kidnap me.
The whole thing was staged.
But... but they stabbed your mother.
I didn't know they were gonna do that.
They told me later that they had to to make it look real.
They said she was gonna be okay, and she was.
The more they talked about this attack, the more I knew what I was doing was wrong.
But when I started questioning them, they tried to kill me and I got away.
They never cared about me.
Thank God you're okay.
I'm not okay, Caleb.
My parents are alive.
Look, I-I know.
I'm so sorry.
Get down, get down.
It's HRT.
HRT took out the remaining shooters, however, uh, CCTV confirms that the front passenger of the van fled after they took out the guard gate.
Coming out there after me, you showed more instinct in an instant than most agents show in a lifetime.
I owe my life to you.
And I hope you saw today what a difference someone like you can make.
See you in class.
Where you going?
It's better you don't know.
No matter what happens, you and Charlie are family to me.
Charlie may have helped plan the attack today.
I'd like to acknowledge the brave men and women who defended our campus today.
That includes one of o ur own... trainee Perales.
Remember why you're here, because though the horrible reality exists that there will be another mass shooting, soon all of you will be able to do something about it.
Hey, are you okay?
I don't know.
There's no chapter in the grief handbook about finding out your parents faked their death for 15 years.
I need to handle some e-mails before I get mobbed by supporters.
I'm waiting for her right now.
Yeah, I told you she'd be desperate to know where her son is.
Caleb's been missing for months.
Question now is... how are you gonna replace the pills in her bag?
I'm gonna hope that the possibility of talking to Caleb is more important than keeping track of her purse.
Okay, she's here.
Give me the room.
Senator Haas.
Where is my son, Agent Parrish?
Why don't I let him tell you himself?
Just ask for him.
He and some other fellows had this rotating poker game.
A nervous knee, a finger twitch.
Handler didn't blink... just like you.
It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.
Only I do.
If you knew I was lying, then why come see me?
And I was right.
Taking a life isn't easy.
You know, you were right.
The FBI may have its problems, but I don't have to be one of them.
We talked this morning about meeting up if he could get away from his undercover detail.
I'm sure he just wants to know if I'm okay.
I'm sure that's all it is.
I have no idea what that is.
Raina, thank you.
Your sister's waiting for you outside.
- How could you do this?
You're not going anywhere.
What's in the bottle, Agent Parrish?
There's still a terrorist out there, Hannah, who's been forcing me to carry out a plot that seems to be targeting the Senator.
They're threatening that they're gonna kill all my friends if I don't follow through.
They've already killed Natalie Vasquez.
Hand me the bottle.
Just do it... and your sidearm, as well.
And go home, and don't leave town, and the next time you see me, it'll be with other agents by my side to haul your ass into prison.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
I didn't give you a chance to talk or hear me out.
I guess then we'll have to make them count, huh?
We'll say everything that we need to say to each other in the next 10 minutes, and then never see each other again.
Well, how many more different ways do I need to say that I'm in love with you?
I did it for you, for us.
If we get back together, then how does it work?
And you keep me off my game, too.
People were shooting at me with real guns today, and... and all I could think about was you.
I'm brand-new, Ryan.
And I can't lose everything that I've ever wanted because of... because of some guy, no matter who that guy is.
We still have eight minutes.
Thanks for the beer.
You were working for my parents, lying to me for 13 years.
13 years.
Took money from you to give to them for a small cut.
And the more I got to know you, the worse I felt.
So you conned me out of another $5 million?
She did ask me to give the money back to you.
I just wanted to look you in the eye and tell you that myself.
Two right there and one over there.
What do you know about my faith?
Everything!
And I know the Qur'an does not teach you to hate.
Hate is what this country feels for true believers like me.
I pray you find peace.
You're right.
Killing Raina out of vengeance?
The Front taught me to be smarter than that.
We wanted to strike a blow to the FBI and we failed today.
Killing you will have to be enough.
Take it.
I said take it!
Prove you're a true believer... or die with her, man.
It don't even matter now.
The cops outside... they're gonna arrest me.
Give me a sit report.
Son, please.
They will shoot you on sight after shots fired in a hostage situation.
I can't go back!
Charlie, get down.
Charlie, get down!
Target locked.
Charlie, get down!
Is Shelby okay?
Can you be after finding something like that out?
If I hadn't told Iris what I did, none of this would have ever happened.
Yeah, well, maybe it was time that she found out.
Maybe it's time you tell me who Mark Raymond is.
What do you want to know?
Is Charlie still in surgery?
Today I prayed... for you.
Time's up.
Why would I do that?
You did exactly what I asked.
You're proving more useful than I imagined.
What must I do to enact this curse?
Hook, I will find you.
I will always find you.
He's growing up.
I bet.
Is this the Underworld?
I was on my way to the Underworld.
Don't go, Emma.
Once you get there, it is not an easy place to get out of.
You couldn't have.
Does that mean... that Hook is there?
Then help me.
Where are you?
Someplace.
Someplace where I'm happy.
I only came here because I care about you, Emma.
I figured.
- Yeah, you passed out.
Yeah. I'm fine.
How is this possible?
How does the Underworld look like Storybrooke?
Your questions are pointless.
All that matters is, all these people in this Underworld are dead and trapped because they have unfinished business.
- Cruella.
Agreed.
The sooner we get out of here, the better.
Happy birthday, my Queen.
And if someone doesn't start talking...
Then tell me.
I want something in return.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You're lucky it's my birthday and I'm feeling benevolent.
Is this really the way you want to spend today?
She ripped out his heart so you would become the merciless queen that she always wanted.
Thank you for bringing me this information.
Uh... there's no sign of him at the park or the town hall.
What if he has no unfinished business?
He died a Dark One, Miss Swan.
If you want things done, let me do them my way.
No luck yet, Mom?
Not yet.
He's in a better place, I promise.
It's uncanny.
Well, when I conjured Storybrooke, it was with the Dark Curse.
I hate her pasty complexion... her insufferable sincerity... and her puny army of sweaty little child-beasts.
I believe they're dwarfs.
I just want this birthday to be over.
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, we must do something about my daughter.
How can I be of service?
If you care for my daughter at all, you will do what I ask.
As you wish.
Cora, are aware of what day it is?
Let me guess... she's wasting it tormenting herself over Snow White.
You have to talk to her.
This was a terrible idea.
Where do you think you're going?
To talk to Snow White.
Goodbye, Cora.
I don't need your help.
Yes.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'll always worry about you.
I want you to be happy.
Then help me find Hook and get out of here.
It's too dangerous.
You need to leave... now.
I promised my friends I would help.
They're what's holding you back.
Sweetheart, you must do what's best for you.
I am.
No, you're not.
And if you won't, I'll see to it that you do.
It wasn't easy, but I've arranged for a boat to take you home.
It departs in one hour.
Take Henry, take your thief, and go before it's too late.
That I would have been enough.
You would have been.
It just took me too long to realize it.
What would happened if I stayed?
Sometimes a mother has to do what's best for her child, even if it's reprehensible.
"Killed" is, um, a relative term down here.
This Underworld... most can only leave it in two ways... to a better place or a worse one.
But you, my sweet daughter, have another option.
Someone will suffer.
Who?
I'll only be gone for a day.
Just long enough to retrieve Hook.
I always do.
Looking for something?
Peter Pan.
I certainly wasn't looking for you.
Aren't you glad to see your dear old father?
Be careful with your threats.
Maybe it's time to put the past behind us.
This is what you're looking for, right?
How generous.
How many strings are attached?
No strings.
Never gonna happen.
I sent you here for a reason.
I miss the world above the tastes, the smells.
Not unless I trade places with a living soul.
And those people you came down with... they are not your friends.
And they are living... for now.
A gesture of goodwill... from a father to his son.
She'll really do that?
She'll throw your father, her husband, into the fire?
Of course she will.
She thinks she's giving me my best chance.
I can't let my father suffer because of me.
The only way I've been able to deal with that is by imaging he went to a better place, but... he didn't.
Absolutely not.
We're not leaving until we find Hook together.
It's dangerous here.
Which is why we're not leaving you alone.
This is the way to find your deceased pirate.
The Ale of Seonaidh from the land of DunBroch.
Pour this over Hook's grave, and we can stop guessing where he is and simply ask him.
You're saying Hook has a grave here in the Underworld?
Everyone down here has a grave.
You'll find the cemetery right where you remember it.
No way.
You're coming with us.
You can do this part on your own.
There's a boat that's leaving soon.
If there's even a chance that will work, we have to risk it.
I got your message.
I'm here because I care about my daughter.
And if the war continues, it will destroy the kingdom, but more importantly, her soul.
Why, because of you, Henry dear.
You played with magic you didn't understand.
And I never let a good mistake go to waste.
Now... forget this ever happened and go enjoy your last few hours.
You okay?
I just hope he is.
It's not holding.
Talk to us.
Talk to me.
Will we?
Did you not just see that?
If she can arrange a way out, so can we... after we find Hook.
We are not giving up on you.
That you were amusing, Jester.
Did you do something?
Oh, I lost track of him hours ago when I had him wrap... this.
Happy birthday, darling.
I don't want anything from you.
Oh, you'll want this.
I did what no one else could do, Regina.
You don't believe me.
Let me show you.
How could you say that?
She'd be dead right now, and all this would be over.
Don't you want me to be happy?
Of course, but not like this.
If you crush her heart, you could be dark forever, Regina.
You'll be just like her... your mother.
That's what she wants.
You betrayed me, Daddy.
This box is as empty as your pursuit.
Is it?
I love you no matter what.
That's what fathers do.
I'm not sure they do.
I think you're very special.
I don't understand how you can be so good.
I don't even know which one is keeping me in this place.
Well, it doesn't matter.
No, Regina.
That's I came to tell you.
You've got a job to do... helping Snow White, your friends.
You finally put vengeance aside to be a hero.
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
But Mother's going to send you someplace worse.
I-I-I can't cause you pain again.
That's the best thing anyone can do.
Let your old man see you doing the right thing.
Then I truly will not have died in vain.
Where's your father run off to?
I still owe him a thank you for spoiling your birthday surprise.
I've already dealt with him.
Because it only took me a day.
And it only took you an hour to lose it.
When I get my revenge, it will be my victory.
You won't be around to steal it away.
There's someone who'd be happy to lend a hand.
Hello again, Cora.
It's done.
Better alone than with you.
You think you're better alone?
You should be on that boat.
I can't turn my back on those I love.
I know that seems like the right choice, but life doesn't work that way.
That's not possible.
Henry, stand back.
I'm so sorry.
What's happening?
Every soul in this town has unfinished business.
And chances are, for a lot of them, we're that business.
What you want doesn't matter.
Our agreement was to find your pirate and get the hell out of here.
You referring to the mythological bird or the muscle car?
The music?
Yes.
But I've never been very fond of the violin.
Did you hear that little tick up there?
It was the sound of your incompetence.
Why do you want my daughter gone?
You see, each clock tick means a soul has left my domain.
Do I look like I like to lose anything?
Yes, because you thought you could get her to do what I wanted, which you couldn't.
I'm surprised you care so much about Regina... especially after what you did to your other daughter.
How do you know about Zelena?
Oh, I know about everything.
Including why you gave her up.
All so you could claw your way out of a miserable peasant life.
That's what they do at mills, isn't it?
Something to think about for eternity.
Bye.
- Money... you came back to me because you need money.
I love you, Bethany.
But I had to run, and if you were smart, you would do the same.
Thanks for meeting me up here.
What is this place?
The woman upstairs is a retired record producer.
Real hard to get tickets.
Music was important to me, so... it became important to you.
You said you wanted me to open up more, tell you about our past.
What?
Then I need to meet the others.
If we're all part of this organization, there are more of us.
For you.
What will it do?
Copy some files we need.
I don't know about this.
I promise we'll get back there.
I should go.
Uno Attack?
Sounds intense.
Must be killing you not to be the best at something.
Don't you worry.
I'm gonna knock that kid off his throne tonight.
I'm subbing in for my dad.
How is he?
He's not great, really.
He's fighting a good fight, though.
Always has been.
Sounds a little like someone I know.
You're welcome to join tonight.
Oh, yeah, a young patient came in this morning.
She was found wandering the streets of Chelsea, covered in blood.
There's been no missing person's reports yet.
There doesn't seem to be anything medically wrong with her, but she's not speaking.
What's your name?
Do you know where your family is?
What's the extent of her injuries?
She had some pretty deep cuts, possibly from metal or glass.
We've given her a tetanus shot as a precaution.
This sketch is an exact match with one of Jane's tattoos.
It's the crest for the Ahmadi family of Syria.
The Ahmadis run a highly secretive, highly organized terrorist organization.
They're responsible for deadly attacks in Syria, Yemen, and Egypt.
He's number five on the FBI's most wanted list.
The SEALS staged a raid on an Ahmadi family compound six months ago.
How could the little girl have seen this family crest before?
She must have had some kind of interaction with the Ahmadis or at least been exposed to that symbol.
What about the notebook?
Her drawings are extraordinarily detailed.
If she's sketching the crest, perhaps there's other valuable intel in there.
Well, I explained to Patterson earlier that the girl has a very severe form of autism.
So taking away the one familiar object she has would be harmful at this stage.
I will get the notebook, but it needs to be on her terms.
We need to find out where she's from... more importantly, how she's connected to the Ahmadis.
This girl could be the key to stopping an imminent terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
Can you tell me, do you have any brothers or sisters?
What about your mom and dad?
This is Russell Franklin, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs.
They confirm the little girl is Tarek Ahmadi's daughter.
If that's the case, her name is Maya.
Ahmadi only has one daughter her age.
- Where's her mother?
Just the maternal grandmother we're trying to locate in Syria.
Nermin and Maya must have slipped through our borders with them.
They wouldn't take that risk unless an attack was coming.
We need to find out where Maya was before she was discovered.
It could be where the clan was hiding.
Finding that might be the only way to stop this attack before it happens.
Doc, can you think of any way to break through to her?
Well, I haven't had much luck with traditional methods of therapy.
Some of these look like the pictures you draw.
I didn't know where I was or how I got here.
All I wanted was to go home.
I want you to know that you can trust us.
This is my sketchbook.
I draw when I'm scared and when I'm happy, too.
It helps me think.
I promise you'll be safe now.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
But we... we need to take a look at your sketchbook.
Would you let us borrow it?
Just for a little while.
Thank you.
My team's been analyzing Maya's sketches.
She obviously has a photographic memory.
All right, so what did you find?
We think her pictures must contain clues to where she's been.
We've been trying to identify any markers or hidden messages.
The portraits in the sketchbook were so detailed, we were able to run them through facial rec.
He wrote a "Vanity Fair" article last year on Cabrera, the leader of Venezuela's Costeno cartel.
I remember, he was brought in for questioning after having several meetings with Cabrera on U.S. soil.
Some fun facts... he's a former amateur boxer and a self-proclaimed adrenaline junkie.
If Maya sketched his face, she must have met him or at least seen him.
He could have helped the little girl and other Ahmadi family members come stateside, too.
Bring him in.
I'm really sorry, but I can't discuss the Ahmadi family without compromising my sources.
Amazing fatteh.
All right, just to be clear, you will spend the rest of your life in prison if we find out you've been withholding information that could prevent a terror attack.
We have a little girl in custody.
Do you have any idea who she is?
There's a big Thai community in Hell's Kitchen now.
It's on 47th and 9th.
It could be any one of these buildings.
All right, well, let's start asking around.
Broken glass... from that window.
And the barbed wire up there.
Maya had cuts all over her arms and legs.
This could be where the Ahmadi cell is camped out.
In here!
She matches a surveillance photo the State Department has on file.
I just hope Maya didn't see anything before she escaped.
I talked to the landlord.
Nermin and Maya arrived yesterday.
I just talked to the M.E. She died from blood loss and it didn't happen quickly.
Nermin must have information about the Ahmadis' attack plan.
If Nermin knew the plan, Maya could have, too.
How do you know Nermin Ahmadi?
It's getting repetitive at this point, but I will... say it again.
I can't reveal my sources.
So, again, how do you know Nermin and why was she here?
Did you help her get into the country?
We believe the Ahmadis are here to plan a domestic attack.
There is a little girl sitting in a room all alone, no idea that her mother has just been tortured to death.
This isn't about a news piece.
This is about an innocent child.
Maya has no one in the world.
If you want to make this right, start talking now.
I met Nermin... in Syria six months ago.
She'd been shunned by the family because of Maya's disability.
When did she arrive?
Do you know anything about an attack on U.S. soil?
If they killed Nermin because she was talking to you, you do realize you're the next target.
They want to know everything that she told you.
Let's draw them out.
The prints found in Nermin's apartment match one of the Ahmadi soldiers you took down.
You got Nermin's killer.
We'll get her stateside as soon as we can.
Maya could still be in danger.
If the Ahmadis think she helped stop an attack, someone will eventually make a play for her.
If they found her once, they can find her again.
In a serene, friendly environment, she might open up.
Shipping her off to some safe house is going to be so jarring for her.
Maya isn't just a little girl.
She's the daughter of one of the most dangerous terrorists in the world.
Dr. Borden's been making progress with her.
I'll go.
She'll have full FBI protection.
This girl could hold the key to taking down one of the most dangerous terror groups if she's with people she trusts.
Until then, she's in your custody.
I haven't been out here since I was a kid.
My dad used to take us camping on the Pennsylvania border.
My dad got us these cheap rubber rain boots.
Yours... pink, purple, flowers all over them.
You loved those damn things so much, you wouldn't take 'em off even when you went to bed.
I know he had his flaws, but... it seems like your dad did try... until everything happened.
Used to be my hero.
I wanted to be just like him.
Have a big yard.
What we do?
I don't think I could be the kind of dad I'd like to be.
I think you'd make a great dad.
For what it's worth.
Thank you.
I'm more of a One Direction man myself.
So... this hall wraps around to the restroom and the two back bedrooms.
And the heating should kick in soon, so just make yourselves at home.
Does the fireplace work?
I guess we're going on the tour.
Sorry about all the construction mess.
It really is a never-ending process.
I fix the plumbing and then the heating goes out.
I repair the roof and then the oven breaks.
In the beginning, it was like a real-life version of the Oregon Trail with only slightly less dysentery.
Tasha, you got a sec?
Yeah, what's up?
I wasn't snooping, but I noticed you were looking through Tom Carter's files.
What are you digging around for?
I'm not digging around for anything.
You need to drop it.
What are you talking about?
Trust me, no good can come from it.
You looked into Tom Carter, too, didn't you?
"It's complicated."
There you are.
Come on, Maya.
That's impossible.
Maya, do you like bananas?
That's a definite no.
Okay, considering that we've touched upon every food group known to man... except the most essential.
Chocolate.
Makes sense.
Chocolate is universally adored.
Well, maybe we need to try cooking some more Middle Eastern foods.
You know, things that she's familiar with.
About half an hour down the road.
Let's go.
Tell Rasha her granddaughter is safe.
She says, "Thank God."
What about her daughter?
Unfortunately, her daughter was killed.
We are so sorry to give her this bad news.
She says she was killed because of her drawings.
I think there was a misunderstanding.
Can you try to explain to her that it was Nermin that was killed and Maya's safe?
She says that she understands, but she was killed because of her drawings.
Her drawings... they can identify all the Ahmadis.
Which means we can finally put a face to the names and take some of them down.
Maya's still a target.
Hey, how's Allie?
What happened?
She was reading into things.
We both kept falling back into bad habits.
You have an incoming call.
Maya is the target.
Mayfair wants us to put Maya in a safe house right away.
We'll bring her back.
We tried calling Borden's cabin, but the landline is down and neither of their cells have service.
We're heading back there now.
She looks happy.
I don't think we're gonna be winning parenting awards.
Well, then we might as well go for broke.
Does the One Direction concert documentary count?
It's dead.
The main junction box is a mile down the road.
- No, I don't have anything that could qualify as a weapon.
Uh, I have my sidearm and a spare clip, and this is all looking promising.
Let's move Maya away from the main room.
Maya, I need you to stay here for just a few minutes, okay?
Maya, you did a really good job.
So we're gonna go now, okay?
We got to go out the back now!
Damn it!
It's a distraction.
Cover me.
Look, Maya, it's okay.
We need to get you away from the house.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Hey, you all right?
She's safe, for now.
You take her away from every face she knows and she'll shut down.
Or at least let me come with you.
Maya only draws things that she's seen before.
You never crossed paths with her when she was in FBI custody, so she must have seen you somewhere before.
Answer me.
It's not what you think.
All fingers point to Franklin.
Franklin had assembled his own team to capture Maya and keep his secret safe.
I'm already working with our friends at the CIA to spread false intel.
Sorry I blew up your house.
It's all right.
Now I've got an excuse to start from scratch.
I'm pretty good at painting walls... once you've got walls, that is.
_
We both know that there's something's not right about Carter's disappearance, and I think Mayfair knows something she's not telling us.
Why would you think that?
Too many coincidences... weird connections between her and stuff that's gone down.
Mayfair is the one person who always has our backs.
I don't know where you're getting your information from.
If you refuse to cooperate, they'll kill Agent Weller.
Oh, I was looking for you too.
I was hoping that I could take you up on game night.
Uh, I'll meet you in the lobby?
Nice necklace, by the way.
I'll go get some.
Bethany, I know what you're doing.
I mean, maybe meeting up in my room wasn't the best call.
You're clearly gonna win again.
It's not fair.
Bye.
Stop looking into Tom Carter's disappearance or you're next.
Previously on iZombie...
I need this.
This is my one thing.
Vaughn, the guy who owns the company thinks he walks on water, that he can charm anyone.
So, I'm trying to figure out a way to use that.
Old high school buddy of mine was a drug dealer.
Last thing that he saw was the Jensen water tower.
So we have two bodies packed full of tainted Utopium buried in a shallow grave.
So, we start digging.
It's a needle in a haystack, man.
If the cured rat regressed to zombie form, it's more than likely that our cured humans will as well.
Hey, I just got your message.
I came as soon as I could.
- Out thinking.
He wouldn't tell me, either.
I thought you should both hear this at the same time.
Oh, no, are you and Mom getting divorced?
Last night, our cured rat, New Hope, reverted to her previous state as a zombie.
Which means the cure is only temporary.
In rats, temporary.
Likely, humans too, I'm afraid.
It appears a latent form of the virus was lurking in New Hope, and somehow re-activated.
There's no reason to think it won't do the same in you.
How long do I have?
It could be a day, six months, a year.
I should know more after I run some tests.
Room temperature zombie sex?
In the stomach of a dead drug dealer with a prosthetic leg.
Well, the good news is, we've managed to narrow the location of his unmarked grave to a single 100-acre field.
You really need to work on the whole "Good news" concept.
How long have I got?
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.
This isn't the sort of visit from old Saint Nick I had in mind.
Beard color, white as snow.
David Biel, a resident of the Yesler Mission Men's Shelter.
Lately, he's been raising them money at Third and Cherry dressed like this, ringing a bell.
Dead Santa, the night before Christmas?
My high school coach thought digging holes and filling them built character.
He'd be so proud.
Add it to the, "Not Utopium" pile.
At this rate, we'll have dug up the entire field by Easter.
Rest, ye merry gentlemen.
I brought the traditional Peking Duck.
I love how giving you are on this Santa brain.
Not having to watch that.
I bring good tidings of great joy and Benjamins!
Merry Christmas!
Get those deliveries out to all the good little boys and girls, huh?
A new zombie hooker isn't just going to show up under the tree.
Can you see?
Well, would you look who's back from sabbatical.
Man, last night almost killed me.
And another beer can.
Is that what she looks like when she's having a vision?
I've gotta go talk to Clive.
A witness saw you outside the shelter flashing a roll of cash.
Where'd you get the money?
I had my broker sell some tech stocks.
This might help.
So, I just got word that a witness places you at a bar across the street minutes before the murder.
You know, it's hard enough being a rich zombie.
You've got to worry about paying taxes, eating brains.
And now some nut-job's out there picking off your kind like ducks in a shooting gallery.
What happened?
You tussle with a Doberman?
One of our client's bodyguards went after Chief by mistake.
Oh, he thinks he may have scratched him.
Well, I guess we'll hear soon if all zombie hell breaks loose.
You know the rules, Hayley.
Looks like you're gonna have to make a decision here, Burdick.
Looks like you will, too.
Is there a word that means both cool and awful?
In the 16th century, the word was egregious.
It's not supposed to be a documentary on zombie biology.
Then mission accomplished.
It's about love and friendship, and what happens when a group of kids face the biggest exam of all, survival.
And this is the drinking fountain where Burdick first got the news that his foster brother was his actual brother.
And that's where Burdick died.
Victim's name was Jordan Mason Marsh.
You should get them to show you footage of the shooting.
That was the plan.
You really know this show, huh?
What do you say we go catch some bad guys?
Uh, don't get carried away now.
It's so incredibly tragic.
Can you think of anyone who might have wanted to kill Jordan?
Yeah, one more.
He said, "Yes."
I mean, you're really plowing through your list.
Tell him I'll be down there when I can.
We got a lab in Tacoma.
To the treadmill!
You can bet it'll be me who gets fired for it, not Numbnuts.
I love the cute little nicknames the crew have for the actors.
What I don't get is how do you pick up a real gun and not realize it?
That's a Smith Wesson peeking out of your shoulder holster?
Except this only shoots blanks.
So where do we find Numbnuts?
Thoughtful, technical.
He raised everybody's game.
Jordan's initials?
I remember the scene you and he did in here after your prom date cheated on you and Jordan helped you through it.
And then he threw acid in the zombie chem teacher's face.
Dude saved my life.
I couldn't save his.
I couldn't save his.
You had a few scenes today with the prop gun.
Any idea where you might have put it down?
I didn't put it down.
Never take eyes off your firearm.
That's the number one rule.
So, you're saying you shot Jordan with the gun you were handed?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Look, I gotta bounce.
But help yourselves.
Anything?
It's like every candy bar on Earth.
What if Prop Master Fitz intentionally handed him a real gun, with a bullet in the chamber?
Interesting theory.
Or maybe Wyatt switched the prop gun for the real gun because he wanted to kill Jordan.
Maybe.
Did you know the donuts at the precinct are all day-old?
That's how civil servants are valued.
Although, if Wyatt set the whole thing up, why not say you put down the prop?
If anyone could've done it, you've got a better alibi.
Is that lasagna?
It's hard for me to imagine Wyatt doing it.
Did you see his face?
He was devastated.
Yeah, he seems real devastated.
I think I'm seeing motive.
"Who will survive?"
Season One, Wyatt's up front.
Season Two, Jordan has joined him.
Season Three, Jordan is the main man.
Cover it.
It's called a Prince Albert.
I wonder how you get it through airport security?
You two don't seem that skeeved.
Besides, we were expecting it.
Jordan's pierced...
Yeah, it's front and center on his sex tape.
It co-starred Zombie High's own Starlee Decker.
She plays Hayley, desired by both Burdick and Cody.
She and Jordan were an IRL item.
But enough about Jordan's famous genitals.
But never forget what?
Ugh, it's like a bad-acting workshop.
This is what you get when a TV show worships at the altar of youth, bimbos and himbos running around screaming, in a school where, apparently, shop class isn't the only place to see something wooden and poorly constructed.
That one needs to remember her character's emotional truth.
That's the essence of acting.
It's a search for truth.
Tell me more about this truth and how to find it.
Like the time I went camping and I saw a bear.
Or the times you've seen actual zombies.
My point is you don't act with words.
That's what gives the words life.
Remember what it's like to eat an apple?
Oh, look there's one now, ripening on this tree.
Hey, I was saving that.
The skin is so smooth and cool.
Fascinating.
I wish I had some popcorn.
Oh, wait, I do.
I think we've got a major problem.
A "Major" major problem or a minor major problem?
I saw your little bro-down in the gym.
Please.
You can't play a player.
You're too vain to see it.
He's blinded you with man-jewelry and the promise of a rock-hard ass.
Well, promise delivered.
Do you know what Mom used to say about you?
"You should've gotten that man's name?"
Vaughn Du Clark, smartest man in the world until you stroke his ego.
Then he's like all the rest.
Sorry, player.
The almond milk seems off.
Just get me a kale-ginger juice.
We were hoping to find Starlee.
Poor thing was in no condition to play a devastated teenager.
I pushed her call till 3:00.
I'd be happy to get you time with her tomorrow.
Oh, grazie.
Oh, we're just here investigating Jordan's murder.
Oh, sorry.
Um, Wyatt told us he never lost track of his prop gun.
As far as you know is that true?
Hilarious.
That dude loses his gun all the time.
It turns up in transpo vans, uh, restrooms, the silverware tub.
Unlike our dear departed Marlon Bran-douche.
Jordan wouldn't even acknowledge us.
You know what'd be fun?
A zombie show where a zombie's the star.
He didn't care that he was gonna put us all out of work.
How's that?
Avoid the flan.
What's with you?
Why were you all twitchy?
Zombies kinda freak me out.
I'm more interested in his tattoo.
The tattoo is a tribute to an assistant director named Jenny Hulce.
We saw Jordan was getting his tattoo removed.
He says, "That figures."
Well, we heard Jordan could be intense.
"He'd only answer to his character name, Burdick.
He refused to shower when the zombies cut off the water supply at the school.
He demanded 30 takes for every scene.
It wasn't intense, it was insane."
Jordan had us working so late on Fridays, we called them Fraturdays.
Kell says, "Jenny Hulce would be alive, if Jordan didn't cause production to shoot so late."
So, basically, this next scene here, 34, is about Cody overcoming his fears.
I was born with one of those kinds of minds that, uh...
How do you call 'em again?
- Photographic?
You be Hayley.
So, even with all the changes, this scene's still about Cody finding the courage...
Let's do it.
"Cody crosses to Hayley, who is crying."
I know that, Hayley.
But there's a whole lot of us who still need you.
What am I supposed to do about it, Hayley?
Do I act like zombies don't exist?
Who wants to help me with homecoming float?
Don't act like everything's cool!
Don't act like we're not in the middle of a zombie apocalypse!
Don't act like life as we know it will ever be the same.
Just act like you know what to do with this.
Let's do this thing.
- Interesting choice.
- It just felt honest.
I'll see you around.
Huh, looks like we know who's gonna be front-and-center on the Season Four poster.
Thanks, but I'm happy in my current job.
It was all about finding my motivation.
Have they posted the new dailies?
I wanna see how Starlee played my scene with Wyatt.
- She helps Cody to overcome...
I thought you hated the show.
I got you something else for your birthday, Daniel.
You can read lips, right?
That's it!
Damn it, Jordan!
Which one of you bastards upper-decked me?
They're not funny.
Jordan wasn't a very popular man on set, was he?
I wonder if he ever put in those security cameras.
I'm going to expose Max Rager.
I'm taking all our research to the press.
Why tell me this?
About the existence of zombies.
Maybe Jordan's surveillance cameras caught the mystery defecator.
Yeah, this is why I became a detective.
Why is Starlee in Jordan's trailer?
And what's she doing on his computer?
Update his system software?
I think he may have made another sex tape of us and never destroyed it.
You think he'd do that without letting you know?
Because I will tell the world!
I don't think you will.
What'd you see?
It sounded like Jordan released the first sex tape, not some burglar.
Starlee was pissed.
The crime lab can check the hard drive.
I doubt they'll find any security cam footage, though.
Bonnie lied.
The writers did decide who to write off the show.
She just didn't want to deal with damage control, if the cast found out.
After we started sleeping together.
Wyatt started agonizing about how this movie might interfere with his job here next season.
I just thought you should know.
If I'm hearing you right, there's going to be another Power Rangers movie?
The real headline is that I still don't believe Wyatt's guilty.
Wait till you see what the computer lab boys found on Jordan's hard drive.
Aw, we missed the good stuff.
Lucky you.
I can barely keep a straight face working with him.
"I smell zombies.
What a horrible person!
And if that went public, it would destroy her career.
Nice robot.
It's a gift from a Chinese business associate.
Sorry, there's nothing in here about it being able to hunt and kill zombies.
Dr. Lockett gave me this.
Dr. Lockett really shouldn't have told you all this.
Welcome to Tacoma.
- Mind doing the honors?
We get our brains from a medical testing facility.
Not exactly the freshest supply, but then again, our patrons aren't what you would call choosy.
Did you ever see a zombie, Major?
Yeah, you know, I see them all the time.
That's why we got all the safety doors.
I think this is the light switch.
Open the damn door!
You did it, my boy.
Hair, makeup, wardrobe.
Perfect for L.A., though.
What the hell?
- Talk to me.
- Jordan's car.
Someone filled it with dirt, and stuck in a tombstone for Jenny Hulce.
The crew member who fell asleep at the wheel driving home after Jordan kept the crew shooting all night?
And the only other person we know who died.
So, who cared enough to kill Jordan over that?
Besides everyone who got a "Never Forget" tattoo?
I don't blame my wife's death on Jordan Mason Marsh, if that's what you're asking.
I told her to quit.
She always complained about her job, but she wouldn't give it up.
Guess she had her reasons.
We saw the "Never Forget" tattoos on the cast and crew.
Your wife must have been pretty beloved.
More beloved by some than others.
I'm even throwing in a little something extra.
I told you, you need to take the yellow coolers out of circulation.
They noted them in the FBI report.
All the others are out.
Not at all.
It's so terrible, what's been happening to all those poor rich people disappearing like that.
Do you think they're dead?
I'm afraid I can't comment on that.
Oh, that's a business line.
Two relatively young people who called the same funeral home?
I hope they made arrangements elsewhere.
Guessing it's a moot point when there are no bodies to bury.
You're a big fella.
In an unrecovered body situation, many people opt for an empty casket, it can help create a feeling of normalcy.
You know, death being not ambiguous.
Good to know.
You know why you're here, Fitz.
As prop master, you figured you could slip that .45 into the hands of Jordan's clueless co-star, Wyatt.
Working those long hours, the crew must really bond.
You didn't tell me you were bringing him in.
Must have slipped my mind.
I thought I was back on the team.
I am not going to just leave, so you can bully him into a Murder One rap.
It was a crime of passion!
It's Murder Two, at most.
This isn't some monster.
I've met monsters.
This is a guy who lost the woman he loved and just needed someone to blame.
She's right.
I hated Jordan for the accident.
That's the day I handed Wyatt the real .45.
It was a split-second decision.
You think Dr. Lockett will forgive you for actually releasing those Romeros on him?
You must bepleased Major passedyour loyalty test.
Our boy has seen the light.
This isn't some monster.
I've met monsters.
You were really good in there.
I guess you figured out your motivation.
Hey, don't leave on my account.
Oh, it's okay, Dale.
See you tomorrow.
Colin Andrews, guy with the dog?
Who's this?
Two of my missing presumed-dead guys had his phone number on them.
This is our guy!
Dr. Eckland, you were not a part of my original reality.
Well, that's gonna make it awkward when you come to bed.
We're going on another trip to see The Witness?
You're walking through a red forest.
Open the gate!
Hey, what's with the dogs?
It's a blender.
How the hell am I supposed to know?
I got the same clearance as you, asshole.
All right, y'all gonna love this.
Jacks... read them and weep, you schmucks.
Whatever, man, you...
What the hell was that?
Why's there no alarm?
What happened to the generator?
Only the Germans would invent a card game where the rules change halfway through.
Where I come, we just call it cheating.
That's because you're losing.
Oh, that must happen to you a lot.
People mistaking your overwhelming warmth and affection for romantic intent.
Dr. Adler?
Do you think you would have married again?
Hey, where's the fun in that?
Where would we be if we were scared away by a little failure?
Not in my bed, that's for certain.
- Doctor Railly.
I saw him.
Dr. Eckland found me the blueprints.
See they put the Time Machine and the Core at opposite ends so if one explodes, it won't destroy the other.
The Splinter Chamber.
Initiate Splinter Sequence.
- Nobody knows.
Cassie's back.
He appeared in the form of Aaron Marker, your ex.
So are you sure you didn't just imagine...
Does this sound even remotely possible?
Yeah, there's some pretty trippy shit going on with that tea.
They would, uh, drink it, and they would see him in their heads.
It's properties allow your consciousness to drift outside time.
He splintered?
The Witness has always been one step ahead of us.
It's possible he could move through time.
He doesn't have a time machine.
If he did, he wouldn't need Elliot Jones to build him that one.
He could have easily just sent the Messengers back in time himself.
It's possible that what I've always feared is true.
His capabilities are equal to our own.
We made progress against them.
We stopped the paradox in '75, slowed the red anomalies outside.
Dr. Railly?
The blood is washed away.
Go to him.
Hey, what are you doing?
Thought you were getting some rest.
Kind of messes with your clock.
That's a joke.
You ever see weird things when you splinter?
You ever see a person?
Person?
Do you believe what she says?
The blood has washed away.
Another tether?
This phantom tether is still here.
Shut it down!
It's overloading.
The machines are overloading splinter radiation.
They've been disabled.
Shut off that damn alarm!
Hey, you okay?
The lens array is totally fried.
Without the lens array to focus the accelerator beam, the machine is going to continue to bleed splinter radiation throughout the facility.
The machine is locked into random sequences.
A scavenger we put in the machine.
How is he here?
This explosion of temporal energy from the machine must have splintered him here.
Well, if that's the case, what else from the time-stream might be in here with us?
Hold on.
What is that?
It was sabotage.
Someone with intimate knowledge of how our machine works is trying to create a temporal meltdown.
The Witness.
That's what he told me he wanted to do... to destroy time itself.
This is his counterstrike.
I thought it was in my head, but it...
The one that burned out our first Core?
But that's all we've got right now.
If anything happens to you, we're all screwed.
How do you know it was The Witness?
Because I've seen him before.
After the Night Room, when they were holding me captive, they had me drink that red tea, and he was there.
Cass, that stuff's dangerous.
Yeah, when he looked like Aaron?
And then he changed his appearance to you.
You hear that?
I'm sorry.
This way.
- Dad...
Lead the way.
Dad!
Dad!
Please, somebody help!
Dad, get him off!
Stop!
Ramse, you all right?
Come on.
I lost Cassie too.
All kinds of shit roaming the hallways.
What are you talking about?
The machine's melting down.
We got to make it to the Core, kill the power.
Oh, I got to go find Sam.
Yeah, we're gonna find him.
Deacon, anybody, over.
All right, it's useless.
Come on.
Well then help me look.
Let's go.
Stop right there!
How'd you get in here?
Dies a pacifist or lives a man.
Violence doesn't make a man.
No, but it's a good way to unmake one.
Point and pull and watch for the kick.
Don't worry, I'll tell all your hippie friends that you fought them off with flowers and rainbows.
Cover me, now!
Come on.
Oh, dear God.
This place was an army base for 60 years.
The machine must have splintered them from the past, but they don't seem fully present, so if we're lucky replacing the array and stopping the dispersment might return them to their time.
I'm adjusting it to fit the energy conduits.
It's getting worse out there.
Just shut down the machine, and whatever stowaways are brought through, we take out one by one.
It is not that simple, Mr. Deacon.
The machine is in perpetual splinter sequence.
Now that we have the array, we can stop the machine from dispersing more temporal energy.
If we can not shut down the Core, that machine is going to turn this entire place into a crater a mile wide.
Crater I understand.
Listen, Mr. Deacon, you have to see that they shut it down.
You too, Dr. Adler.
Sam, you okay?
She's got a gun on my son.
Damn it.
Everything's gonna be fine.
You need to open this door.
That thing melts down, this whole place is gonna go up.
Please.
What are you doing?
Hey, he's trying to tell us something.
What's he saying?
Cole, there's a river beneath us.
That's how we can get in.
What do you see?
Straight down, 50, 60 feet to the river.
Still got to figure another way back up.
All right.
The Core is still active.
Clearly whatever splintered here is stopping Cole from shutting it down.
We have to replace the array regardless.
There's no choice, Kat.
David, what are you doing?
But it might save you.
Talk to me, Cole.
Getting close.
I'm gonna have to cross.
Roger that.
Ramse, what the hell are you doing?
Cole's down there.
Where are you?
Let me out!
Get your hands up.
What'd you do to us?
We got a man down there, you understand me?
I don't love you.
Cole, are you okay?
What the hell's going on up there?
Where are you?
Sam, it's okay.
She's not gonna hurt you.
Are you, Cass?
Why don't you put that gun down?
Whatever it is they did to you, that's what's causing this.
If you can hear me in there, you need to fight.
Who are you?
The forest is red.
The grass is tall.
I'm talking to The Witness, aren't I?
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.
So why don't you tell me, asshole, exactly what is it that you've witnessed?
Let him go.
You hurt him, you're dead.
Running out of time.
Remember when you said we didn't really know each other anymore?
You were wrong about that.
And I know you.
And I know... you would never let me die.
Ramse, shoot me.
Shoot me!
Come on, shoot me.
Hey, you okay?
Ramse, the Core!
We did it, buddy.
James, get out of the Core Room... now!
There's going to be a feedback of splinter radiation.
Is he dead?
I don't know.
Unlikely.
He was just a boy.
He was my boy.
How's James?
He has no major internal injuries.
With his ability to heal, he should be fine.
Katarina, what happened to me?
The tether we detected was not connected to another time-traveler physically but instead to a consciousness.
It was a signal from somewhere in time.
He took control of you to sabotage the machine.
I've prepared a series of injections that will purge whatever the 12 Monkeys left in your blood.
This is my fault.
He's watching over us while our founder, the Guardian of The Light, Dr. Steven Meyer, he's in Peru transcribing the last three rungs of The Ladder.
My dad started selling me to his friends when I was 11.
Where the fuck have you been?
That's my dad.
What's your name?
Who'd you meet at the motel last night?
I mean, am I going to blow up my life because of something I don't even know if I really saw?
I guess so.
I see you.
Take his hand.
Back in time.
It's your turn.
Okay.
I just want to move forward.
We can't move forward until you reveal everything, because you're still protecting Miranda Frank.
I don't.
I'm going to recommend 14 days in-house, Eddie.
I just want our life back.
Now, let's talk about non-verbal techniques we can use to further enhance this connection.
Wow, Modigliani.
No.
The rest is a distraction.
Thank you so much for coming.
It's been hell.
I'm prepared to make a very large donation for your help in this matter.
Hey, again.
I just really need someone to see what's happening there, and I don't really know who else to go to, so...
We express deepest gratitude for this day and every day, for the gift of this passage, and that we have found The Ladder.
There is one Spirit whose name is Truth.
It can be a dangerous time, Eddie.
The Ladder provides the rest.
You hear Snyder got moved to terrorism?
- Hey, Abe, do you hear that?
Can I just unburden for a second?
It's a challenge to put aside our feelings, but it's for the greater good.
Yeah, and a big donation.
Donation or no donation, you tell this John Ridge I'm going to fix his child.
I know I joke and flirt with you, and I know you have your whole family, but... you know I'm here if you ever...
No one got to Rindge before FEMA.
The ones who long for truth, like her.
My sister.
Six months ago, they killed my husband in Peru when he said he was done.
They knew where to find me.
I'm not.
Try it.
Last year.
What do you think?
Well, I got to clean up and get this one started on his homework.
Did your dad die in a bad way?
What's wrong with you?
Found all these in the trash.
She hasn't paid the mortgage in, like, four months.
Now they're going to take our house away, and I tried to talk to her about it too.
I, like, brought these to her, and she completely freaked out and started, like, yelling at me.
We shouldn't still be doing this.
Well, your dad was a good man.
But those who need The Ladder find The Ladder.
Not with us on the street corners like Jews for Jesus.
Yeah, I think we're done for the day.
How are we going to get through this?
Because it's designed to make it better.
And your pain will just go away?
You know, you said you never made a mistake, but maybe you did.
I am so mad at you.
Mom, Dad?
You guys up here?
It's a ten-minute human interest piece that the 15 people who watch the local news will see.
Steve has always said that media attention will only bring controversy and ire to the purity of our movement.
Sarah, Cal just opened his heart to you, and I feel like you didn't open yours.
Don't, like, tell anyone about what I told you, okay?
You mind if I do it?
It's just someone who used to be one of us that isn't anymore.
Does it say how?
Okay, hey, Hawk, slow down.
I listen.
I love you guys, and I would never do anything to hurt you.
Well, you did hurt us.
I know you hurt Mom, and you really hurt me, and now, God, everything's just messed up and confusing, and I just want everything back the way it used to be.
Looking for you.
Thinking.
Well, you're a natural.
Yeah, well, it's easy when you believe.
Together you'll bring so many to The Ladder.
I wanted to talk to you about something really quick, before the kids get up.
I'm going to do the program, Sarah.
I just want this to be over with.
I want to be back to before.
Everything was so clear, and now I feel like I don't know.
I am so glad you're doing this, Eddie.
But we have to be better than the IS.
Our founder is The Guardian.
A movement of people with a very simple vision to be everything God intended when He created us in His image, so we believe that by achieving personal enlightenment, or Truth, we can achieve universal enlightenment, universal Truth.
Because if you listen very closely, you will hear the souls calling out for help.
And you will find that some of them are in your backyard, and maybe if you listen even more closely you'll find that the soul in need of care is your own.
But perhaps one soul at a time we transform our broken, broken world into a place that is whole again.
Well, that sounds...
Sign me up.
Not today.
We're taking your son, and I promise we will get him off drugs, but here's what I need from you.
You're going to take The Eye from your little museum, and you're going to hang it prominently on the wall above the piano.
And then you're going to get another Eye, and you're going to hang it in your office.
And then you're going to tell everyone you invest for about this movement that has spoken to you, that has made you see the world in a new way, and that has saved your son.
I'm a prisoner!
I want your faith.
- Is there anything different about the way that you thought sexually about her than any other woman than you think sexually about?
What turned you on about Miranda Frank?
You're wasting my time.
The Witness took control of you.
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.
He was my boy.
You're still holding on to the memory of her... holding on to her dead little hand.
I leave now, not with my own, but those words that will exist beyond me.
"No traveler returns.
It's Cassie.
The tether... it disengaged itself from the system and then reappeared... some kind of glitch.
It's entirely unnecessary to maintain her tether.
Clearly, Dr. Railly hasn't done anything yet.
There's still time to bring her back.
Where did Cassie go?
2020.
Because there was another plague... one that ravaged time itself... a plague whose origins can be traced back to one single moment.
The true catalyst for the destruction of mankind is standing before your eyes.
I sent Cassie back to Spearhead in 2020 with the explicit instruction to end my life and so destroy the creation of time travel.
And undo everything.
Jones, this isn't the way.
The answer, Mr. Cole, has been in front of us the entire time.
We were on a quest to stop the Messengers from collapsing time, but it was this... it was this that allowed them to do it.
We fear the Witness, yet my attempt to rewrite history resulted in the destruction of time itself.
You don't get to decide it's over just because you've given up hope.
We've exhausted hope, James.
No, Cole, we have to stop this.
Lasky... when exactly did you send her back to?
I sent Cassie back to the day I should have died, the day I lost my Hannah.
This will predate our mission together.
Everything will be erased.
Start it up.
Open the gate.
Stop there!
I'm not.
I hit a few rough patches on my way up from Baltimore.
Baltimore?
On foot?
Tell me, Ms. Railly, how did you avoid the West Seven Quarantine Zone?
I went around it.
Nobody goes around the West Seven Quarantine Zone.
Have you been tested for immunity to the Kalavirus?
Yes.
Who are those people?
We call 'em scavs... roaming survivors.
There's limits to the amount of civilians we can take in.
This way, please.
Lieutenant.
I have to say, it'll be a big morale boost for our teams to actually meet you, Dr. Railly.
The containment protocols you pioneered have been very helpful, along with a few of our own.
See, 75% of our population has been diagnosed at risk of infection, and I intend to keep those numbers safe and sound, which is I'm very curious about what happened at the CDC.
See, the last we heard, after the broadcasts stopped, rioters had taken over the building, so, naturally, we assumed the worst.
Some of our men encountered a very organized pack of marauders... nomads, all women.
We think they're responsible for bringing in this recent outbreak.
But the rest are isolated, so we have it under control.
I'm afraid your timing couldn't be any worse.
Virologists are a vanishing and highly valuable commodity.
Measures necessary for the security of our medical personnel.
You've stopped treating the sick?
These aren't all my decisions, but we've lost some great minds while trying to save the lives of those who never stood a chance.
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Jones's daughter has passed.
Katarina.
She's gone.
It's time.
I already did.
Fire!
Present... arms!
No, I already...
Why didn't anything change?
Because you haven't done anything yet, and you're not going to.
No, I did.
Open the gate.
Hey, stop there!
Dr. Cassandra Railly with the CDC.
CDC's dead.
And who are you?
Cole, I shot her... point blank.
It was my fault just as much as Jones's.
We've made things worse, Cole.
We need to stop ourselves.
What about the plague?
I came up through Baltimore.
Look, we went through all this yesterday.
You spoke to somebody else yesterday, not me.
- What is this?
You guys!
Oh, wait, I got to figure out which version of you two this is.
Okay, Night Room, total...
So welcome to 2020.
That number usually represents perfect vision, but it looks like you two aren't seeing too clearly.
Heard you were a busy girl.
Voices say you blew poor old Jonesy away, and then they say you didn't.
Well, I'm in a reboot.
That's not how time travel works.
You're saying the moment she shot Jones, time reset itself?
You two, come with me.
Got to go.
See you soon!
They're, like, my best friends.
I have to say, it would have been a big morale boost here for our teams to have met you had you actually been Dr. Cassandra Railly.
You do look like her.
It turns out Dr. Railly was confirmed dead at the CDC by our own personnel... so you can't be her.
I am Cassandra Railly.
Are you aware that entering a military base under false pretense is currently punishable by death?
Now, tell me who you are.
I'm sorry, Jones.
I'm not shot anymore.
You saved me.
Well, don't get too excited.
We need to split up this time.
That's not happening.
It's why I'm here.
Then figure it out.
My mission is the same.
I have to say, it'll be a big morale boost for our teams to actually meet you, Dr. Railly.
Round three!
I think she has my gun.
Jesus, I'm dying here.
Mom...
Your daughter, Hannah... how is she?
She's just ill.
Definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
What are you doing here?
I thought Foster's orders were clear.
Katarina, sorry to disturb you, but have you seen...
See you soon.
The containment protocols you pioneered...
Excuse me, Lieutenant Foster.
Forgive me, but I was hoping I could see some of your recent data on the virus.
Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties, 'cause it's cold out there!
Get it?
No?
What is this?
Look, if you want to save Hannah, I need your help.
Save her how?
The Kalavirus's key symptom is an uninterrupted increase in body temperature.
Nothing, not even medicine, can stop the increase or suspend it.
We need to figure out why she's the exception.
- What's her temperature?
- Still 107.
If it gets any higher, she'll be at risk for brain damage.
Sensitivity to light...
Dr. Railly, are you okay?
What happened?
Nothing.
It doesn't matter.
Hannah's immune.
She doesn't have the virus... possibly a form of meningitis.
She dies because of Foster's no-treatment protocol.
You saved her?
That was yesterday's today.
She'll die again today.
Jennifer said something about time not letting us kill Jones or change her.
Maybe that includes saving Hannah.
We need to ride the day out here, see if the machine brings us back.
We tried it your way.
What do you think Jennifer really meant?
She said... time knows Jones invented time travel, and it needs her to do it.
They were much older than us.
There was five of them... just armloads of guns.
They had these green boxes of ammo at their feet, and they saw two of us out in the open, broad daylight, and they just lit us up.
And we thought we were dead.
Not a single bullet hit us.
The way I like to look at it... it wasn't our day to die.
God or time or whatever... didn't want us to die.
Thinking like that helped us through some hard times... believing that there's something out there helping you out.
What's the other way to look at it?
Remington makes blanks, and they come in a green box.
You know, I don't blame Jones for asking you to do this.
I got plenty of things I'd undo if I could.
2013... breaking into your car and waiting for you.
Yeah, but in those years, you could have found some real happiness.
I didn't have to go to that hotel and wait for you, but I did.
So, please, stop blaming yourself for me.
Go... save the world, Cole.
Ah, to hell with the world.
You didn't have the Witness in your head.
Tell me, why is this still worth it to you?
The only world I ever gave a damn about was the one with you in it.
What is it?
Nothing.
A memory.
A memory of what?
Tomorrow.
Just give me a minute.
Did you ever think of maybe doing something, but not doing it?
I'm getting pretty tired of hearing you talk in circles.
Think about it.
What needs to be done?
First and foremost, what needs to be done to save the world, Cole?
Get you to stop talking.
What needs to be done to save the world is to believe that you can.
Not just for you.
Okay, put the pieces together, okay?
Think about me.
If tomorrow comes and I die, who's gonna tell Jones to bring you back from the hotel and bring you to 2044 like I did... will do... for you?
Plus, you're gonna need another primary.
So, me, Jones... we're pieces of the puzzle.
You got to make them fit.
Okay... so now tell me... what do you need to do to get out of the loop de loop?
So I have to do something, but the problem is, I have to do nothing.
I want to talk to Foster... now.
How could you, Katarina?
What is the meaning of this?
To betray us, to risk so many lives, and Hannah, even.
I told them about you working with us... about your plan to eliminate all the nonimmune from Spearhead by having Jennifer and her people bring the virus in.
Answer the question.
Why would you do that?
I think I know how to get us out of here.
I did what you asked me to do.
Every time we killed you back there, time reset the day.
She was there at Spearhead.
Of course she was there.
She's causality's fool.
So what's your hypothesis of what that exactly means, Mr. Cole?
Time needs us... needs you to set things right... to fix it... to stop the 12 Monkeys from destroying the world.
Time is on our side?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Cole, but I've spoken to Adler.
Your tethers were caught in a perpetual slingshot sequence.
That is why you splintered into the same day repeatedly.
Time had nothing to do with it.
It was our broken machine that you failed, once again, to undo.
You need to come with us.
So tomorrow came.
You're the puzzle-maker.
I had an idea.
I had to talk to you about it first.
Is a little bit of happiness better than a lifetime of anything else?
What are you saying, Mr. Cole?
Hannah didn't have the plague.
She was immune... like you.
She died of bacterial meningitis.
I saved her once with you, but the day reset anyway.
Time... wouldn't let us change your history in any way.
It needed you to create time travel.
It needs us to complete the mission.
I held her hand.
Now, you can say that the time loop was just a glitch in the machine, and you can believe that, but the only thing that stopped the loop was this.
For you to create time travel, you had to lose Hannah... or at least believe that you did.
But, Jones, we changed the timeline.
They told you Hannah died in their care, that her body was incinerated with the others.
It wasn't.
An auspicious change has befallen me.
I find myself guiltily relenting on my ranting and ravings.
Is death not necessary for the past to be erased?
I shall not know.
The undiscovered country does not beckon me.
How is she?
I'm surprised she doesn't hate us.
She lost 24 years with Hannah because of what we did.
Well, Hannah was dead before.
Now she has a chance to know her.
It's not perfect, but it's something.
I'd rather have that moment and lose it than die never having had it at all.
You say that now.
But it's the losing that haunts us.
This can't happen.
You know why I left this place?
'Cause I hated everything about it.
Couldn't stand the sight of it.
It's what hell must be like.
Cole sees a light in you.
I don't.
You see, what happened to you happened... because you wanted it.
I don't blame you, Ramse.
I can't.
But what if we could find the one responsible?
The Witness.
I saw a place... called Titan.
Then what?
We kill the Witness.
There's a house in the distance.
Upstate New York, a paradox so powerful, destroys the fabric of time.
Spit in the face of death and leave your daughters to face off against the Army of the 12 Monkeys.
Ladies, mount up.
I don't want to be afraid anymore.
Right now, it's January.
How are we going to figure out which one is the Primary?
Being Primary is like being schizophrenic.
Look for people who twitch, talk to themselves, don't fit in with others, people who stand out.
Then we have to check everyone... no matter what.
What's the problem, Cole?
Get your hand off of me.
What?
Jesus, Railly, you are a piece of work.
We only have two days left to stop a paradox that will destroy the world, and we don't have a single lead.
- You sure about this one?
- He's not Primary.
Did you look at all the drawings?
Maybe there was some kind of a code or a pattern.
Did you go through every single page?
Does that make me stupid or a liar?
Neither one changes the fact the guy's not Primary.
Look, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel with these two.
Are you sure that none of these people look like the Messengers you saw in 2043?
I only got a good look at a few of them, not all.
- Check again.
And O'Dare, I tried so hard to get to know O'Dare he thinks I'm trying to get into his pants.
That's what you're worried about?
None of these people are Primary.
We know there's gonna be a paradox.
I would be very careful about what you say to me next, Cole.
- Where are you going?
What are you doing here?
- It's, uh, my night out.
- I don't get it.
Melinda says that I can't be home tonight.
Says I can't just sit around and watch her be sick all the time.
It's that chemotherapy.
You know, the same chemical that they put in her body is what they use in mustard gas?
The same shit that killed people in that war... it's in her veins.
I'm sorry.
So what are you doing here?
- I'm just clearing my head.
- Let me guess, uh... she's getting tired of you being paranoid about people.
I got my reasons.
I swear you see more red than goddamn Joe McCarthy did.
Instead, you could go upstairs and put your arms around that pretty lady and make nice for once.
- It's not like that.
And whatever is stopping you two, it isn't worth it.
Something special.
Because he doesn't think that she will...
It's just so cruel.
So when I say what I say, you know I know.
Speaking of, I'm gonna take my own advice and I'm gonna go home.
- See you at work, Cole.
- One of them...
- Could be our Primary.
Yeah, there's never enough time, is there?
This is our last chance.
I didn't know it would be like this.
Measure your life by counting precious moments.
You... will conquer all obstacles.
Your smile is a treasure to all who know you.
Oh, please.
- Are you hurt?
- She was trying to protect me.
You eat 'em too, huh?
- I don't know what it's called, but there's a place with lights and sounds.
What else?
It's coming.
We have maybe a day or two, but that's it.
People are tired, need rest.
I'm the Mother, not you.
Wise are those who know that they are not wise.
Your wisdom used to have meaning, and now it's just...
- Stop that.
- Got it?
How far did you get?
Zeit says that Titan doesn't exist.
Cole didn't stop anything.
We're done following this girl.
Then do as I say.
No more killing!
Stop.
Weapons down.
Our sister chose this for herself.
Please, Ramse.
I'll be supervising you, because the last time we did this job, some nimrod fell off and busted his head clean open.
Had to shovel him off the pavement.
So watch yourselves, because I don't want to be dealing with that shit again.
The system is gonna need cleaning, fixing, and we got three days to do it.
- For what?
I found a way in.
One of the guys on the crew, he had that... twitchy quality to him.
- Dupuy, I'll see what I can find.
- Cole, if it's him...
Hey, man, watch what you're doing.
Hey, your name is Reginald, right?
Why don't you come with me?
You know, you're not supposed to be going through those hiring files.
Those are confidential.
I was looking for paper.
Here.
You serve in the war?
Spend any time in the hospital?
Red Forests?
Time, uh...
Where have you been?
Those coordinates say Titan should be right here.
I told you it wasn't.
So this is the route we should take, but we don't know what's out there.
They're not going with you.
You want my wisdom?
"Measure your life by counting the precious moments."
"Your smile is a treasure to all who know you."
"Your lucky numbers are 10, 42, 75, and 3."
And if I'm being frank, my daughters are assholes!
- Where are you going?
You taught us to be willing to give our lives for each other.
If you won't be a part of saving theirs, at least give them yours.
I'm coming with you.
- No, no, if he sees us together, he's gonna know something's up.
You telling me you don't have any idea?
Where are we going?
- Turn around.
You know why this has to happen.
Oh, my God!
There's a woman here with a gun.
- Where's my husband?
Put it down.
I'm sorry.
The money he gave me, to act like I was afraid of you.
But he drew the picture.
Who is your husband?
Charlie.
Baby, put that down.
It's time.
You know what you're supposed to do with this.
I've known my whole life.
I knew it would be you from the moment I saw you.
It's time.
You're one of the 12.
- You're a Messenger.
- I can't hurt her.
- Where's the other Messenger?
I'm not like them.
Not everything the Witness said was true.
Do this... and we can live forever in the Red Forest like you said.
I'm sorry, Cole.
But you of all people should understand this.
Do you see that?
I know you can't hear me.
I'm sorry.
The best thing that can happen now... is for you to wake up... and forget you ever knew me.
It's just rained.
Most of the blood has washed away.
You've been there before.
We weren't sure if you'd ever wake up.
You sustained quite a few injuries.
- The trauma to your head was...
Where's Cole?
We haven't had any patients from the explosion besides you for six months.
It's a miracle you're still alive.
Six months?
You were out for quite some time.
The explosion happened in 1957.
It's now 1958.
- The kid with the bug bite and the rash.
Not one of them has ever heard of anything called Lyme disease or watermelon disease or potato disease either.
Look, I got really good marks in Med School.
The patient needs Penicillin V or he'll die.
Where are you right now?
I'll have a whisky sour.
Said to say they found an address for that name you were looking for.
What are you doing here?
Why this house?
I was driving by, saw the "for sale" sign.
It needs a lot of work.
But I knew you would.
Why did you go?
I did what I always told you I was gonna do.
I found a place for you to be happy.
I mean, look around.
So that's it?
After all of that, we just forget about the future?
I don't know what else to do.
You being... here, doesn't make sense.
No, you didn't.
You did it for you because you're afraid.
Do you have running water at least?
We have to wash it first.
What is it?
Most of the blood has washed away.
You've been there before.
I've been here before.
You see him.
Go to him.
Know him.
You.
What are you talking about?
Why would you walk towards the weird music?
Ramse, nothing about this place says "good idea."
He's here.
Keep moving.
Turn around!
This isn't permanent.
Go live a life that's not full of fear and death.
That's not why I left.
Then what was it?
I wanted you to be free... of me.
I've always known, Cole.
And you kept pushing me away... so that in the end you wouldn't have anything to lose.
And now... you don't.
Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.
What is happening?
I don't know.
But it's beautiful.
And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.
Ooh, we should watch that next girls' night.
We could do a double feature with the Leonardo DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet.
Oh, I love me some Leo.
And it's gone.
Good for you.
My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.
Glad to hear it.
I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.
Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
Let me refresh your memory.
Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.
You can rub your own chest.
Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.
I hope laughter is the best medicine, 'cause this care package is a joke.
Hey, she came all the way here...
You're gonna want to take these with food.
Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.
She's a dermatologist.
I went to medical school.
Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.
All right, here you go.
Leonard, I'm dying.
I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?
Physically, yes, but I'm upset because everyone's mad at me for no good reason.
You know how, when you're sick, you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people's feelings don't matter?
Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be... unbearable.
That's why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it's ended.
You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?
You know, I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick.
I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
We should all take a trip or something.
You know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas.
Maybe we should all go.
So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.
Oh, that could be fun.
But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?
Yes.
Oh, where are we going?
Well, Vegas, but...
He's coming, too.
I said, "What's new?" but sure.
Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?
Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.
Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.
I can't believe you're not on my side.
I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
Who else's side could you have been on?
Sheldon, I understand that you're upset because you feel left out, but I don't know why we're even talking about this.
Just apologize to them.
Fine, if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip.
Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad.
I have empathy.
Watch.
Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.
Great.
Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.
Hey, I felt a little something.
I was mean to him.
He must have felt terrible.
Oh, now I feel terrible.
Glad I could help.
Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
I feel so, so bad.
Hey, we're both great at this.
Leonard, get ready for an apology.
Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that's not on me.
You're still not coming.
I know that we don't play this game very often, but you're doing it wrong.
Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick.
I'm not in a position to just say you can come.
Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it's okay, then yes, you can come.
Well, I hope it's as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.
All right, that's eight hours of practice down the drain.
And to memorialize this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.
"Sheldon Cooper apologized to me""
"And he made it all better."
All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.
Can this wait?
Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out!
And I want you to know that I mean it, you know?
This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.
What trip to Las Vegas?
The one everyone's taking this weekend on the party bus.
Of course, I wasn't invited.
That would be my understanding.
On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?
Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behavior.
I hope that you can accept my apology.
Of course I do.
And, Emily, I'm sorry for saying dermatologists aren't real doctors.
And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.
Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?
Okay, the point is that we accept your apology.
Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.
No, come on, please don't leave!
Don't worry, you're good.
I caused that fight, I feel terrible.
Wait, I can do that better...
Yeah, wow, I don't know which one I like more.
She used harsh language and slammed the door.
Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.
You think they'll still go on the trip?
All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth...
What is wrong with you?
Look at him, caring about what's wrong with me.
That is some top-shelf empathy.
Hey, well, we should start a club.
Well, I suppose I should apologize again.
Is she okay?
I didn't know that was an option.
Well, that is fine, because I've decided that I won't be joining you.
I've realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.
That's very mature of you.
Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you'll come back with is personal growth.
And there's your next T-shirt.
Ooh, check out the stripper pole.
You know what that means.
This is so cool.
You couldn't give us just one weekend?
I told him this was a bad idea.
But what you don't know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well.
I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know?
And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.
Then I'll be leaving now.
But I want to stay.
Stuart, now!
You know, I know he's a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.
And now you see the problem.
Come on, you pain in the ass!
That's me!
Bye, Stuart.
Of course you're a Wolowitz.
Son of a bitch, he bit me.
Okay, I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
When I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.
"We"?
What is this?
"Continued on milk."
If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.
"We are the champions"?
Are you sure?
Pretty positive.
This is incredible.
We're gonna be parents?
We're gonna get to board planes first.
Finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.
I know, it's crazy.
It is crazy.
I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.
And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage.
We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.
I-I don't know, Howie.
People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.
How's it gonna be okay?
Look at me, I'm a mess.
And that means this baby's gonna half a mess.
And that's even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.
Why didn't you discover it?
Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
If it's "thank you" for the homemade jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.
What's going on?
Why "oh, no"?
Because this changes everything.
How can we do those things with a child around?
Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
I guess we'll call this a draw.
Howie and I are going to...
Yeah, it's all real exciting.
I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
You're probably right.
After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
I shouldn't be raising a kid.
I don't even eat my own vegetables.
Buddy, I-I think you might be overreacting.
And then there's this nose.
I mean, what if he looks like me?
Or worse... what if she looks like me?
Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.
I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.
I know-- you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
This isn't a joke.
I wasn't joking.
Go out and celebrate.
But not your worst idea.
Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Can't drink.
We can, but all right.
Doctor said I can't have sushi.
Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.
Maybe you should get a new doctor.
What, he said you can't laugh either?
He can have all the kids he wants.
And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
There's no reason you can't.
Okay, how about this for an invention-- slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.
How is that a new invention?
The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff-- you.
That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus.
Hey, how you doin'?
Maybe that's an idea-- guidance systems for drunk people.
And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.
I kind of already do that for Howie.
And-and whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
Oh, that sounds juicy.
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out...
You did it at our place?
I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out.
I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.
That's a good sign.
Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
I'd enjoy that.
Nah, she's a good kid.
If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
Of course he's right.
You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.
That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're welcome.
And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
If you can't go in, we're not going in.
Then why are we drinking?
That sounds fun.
What's it say?
"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."
How is that a drunk text?
He used a period instead of a question mark.
He's so wasted.
If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.
I'm really glad you're here.
So, you gonna get up there later?
A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it?
You bet I am.
Thank God, 'cause I was lying-- you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants.
But I'm also really excited.
I'd like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and... now the mother of our child.
What about you?
I think we'd make amazing parents.
Will you guys keep it down?
On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
Fascinating so far.
It is.
How much longer is this gonna take?
Couple more hours should do it.
And we couldn't have done this closer to home?
And Mr. Ochoa was found on this very spot.
You'd be surprised at the specificity of insects depending on where you are in this city.
You know, there's a species of ant which has been found to exist only within a ten-block stretch of the Upper West Side.
The ManhattAnt.
I did not make that up.
There's a restaurant not far from here that got good reviews-- I'm gonna get us some food.
San Gimignano.
Something wrong?
I'm just tired.
Captain Gregson!
Joan!
What are you doing here?
Uh, Sherlock and I are staking out a... a steak.
She's, um, she's a doctor.
Hey, you better move this damn car before I move it for you!
Don't know what you think you're gonna find over there.
The absence of mystery does not mean there's nothing to learn.
How often does one get to examine the effects of one human body crushing another?
But if I'm interfering with your work...
Knock yourself out.
I think this belongs on your table.
Her neighbors report seeing her wandering on numerous occasions, lost in her own building.
Also found an ottoman placed against the railing of her balcony as if she'd used it to climb.
I doubt this woman's moved anything heavier than a teacup in years.
Judging from the degenerative damage to the hands and feet, I'd say she had... severe arthritis, wouldn't you?
You think someone else put it there?
I think you should just, you know... delay your report until I've had a look at the scene.
You know... if she was murdered, then Mr. Leary becomes a homicide, too.
And to think, a moment ago you were calling this case boring.
I think Mrs. Graham might not just be a murder victim, she might be a murder weapon as well.
Um, about last night...
Sit down.
We started seeing each other about a year ago, but she wanted to keep it quiet for my sake.
Some of the cash they recovered never made it back to the precinct.
And not to make excuses, but, uh... at the time, she felt like she didn't have any choice.
They all got caught.
She cooperated-- she was never charged-- but as part of the deal, she put in her papers.
And she thinks if other cops knew about your relationship, it would reflect poorly on you.
So... when I called you "Doctor" last night...
Honestly, uh, I thought she was over this months ago, the hang-ups, the worries, and... all of a sudden, out of the blue, couple of months ago, it became this... thing again.
She could tell something was up.
So when I told her who you really were...
She broke up with you?
Rest of the units are rentals.
Interesting that a woman with dementia could care so attentively for a pet.
Why do old people always have that smell?
Uh, it's a buildup of a compound called 2-nonenal in their sweat.
Which is also responsible for the cardboard taste of stale beer.
I found her arthritis meds.
I'd say you're probably right about Mrs. Graham not moving that ottoman.
Well, whoever did move it did so quite recently.
These are yellow.
Switching an addled woman's medication would be an ideal way to incapacitate her, making it much easier to hurl her from a balcony.
Which makes the next question, who else was up here?
Building doesn't have cameras, and the tenants say they didn't see anyone.
Well, lucky for us, then, that whoever moved it might have left us a sample of their DNA.
So we're looking for someone who threw an old lady off a balcony?
Blood on the underside of the ottoman has been submitted for DNA analysis.
It could be a while before we have those results.
Marcus and I were, however, able to identify the mysterious pills found in place of Mrs. Graham's arthritis medicine.
Clonazepam.
That's used to treat seizures and anxiety disorders.
Absolutely.
And might those symptoms be mistaken for dementia?
You think that's what the killer wanted.
Mrs. Graham had no prior history of either senility or depression.
Inducing signs of dementia in recent weeks could have set the stage for the tale we were all meant to believe-- that in her confused state, she wandered off her balcony to her tragic end.
Plus, you said she had money.
You witnessed their secret tryst last night, he invited you to the precinct to discuss, and now you're reading up on a defrocked female cop.
She didn't want anyone to know about their relationship.
I bumped into them, she broke up with him.
This has all gotten horribly out of hand.
Yes, I replaced my mother's arthritis medication, but I never meant for her to die.
Are you saying that...
She was my mother.
We were under the impression you thought she fell.
She told us at Thanksgiving she was cutting us out, said we were a bunch of spoiled ingrates who cared more about her money than about her.
So far, I'm inclined to agree.
And you thought if she showed signs of dementia, you could have her ruled incompetent and have the will thrown out.
The hearing was gonna be in a few weeks.
Actually, from where I'm sitting, he just proved he didn't have a motive.
Mom left the entire estate in trust to Eustacia Vye.
Her best friend.
As in "man's best friend."
Eustacia Vye is Ms. Graham's prize-winning Shih Tzu.
We can rule her out as the killer.
Rosalyn was a tough old broad.
You know, a lot of guys at the firm didn't like her, but I did.
When you dropped her, which way was she pointing?
Um, wait a minute, I-I thought she fell.
I'm sorry, are you saying you think someone killed her?
You think that I--?
You were her lawyer.
Maybe you sweet-talked her into changing her will.
No one ever sweet-talked that woman into anything.
When Leona Helmsley died, she left $12 million to her dog.
And the same thing's gonna happen here.
Her kids have already put a freeze on her accounts.
I just accepted an offer from a firm in Chicago a few weeks ago.
Feel free to confirm that with my bosses.
Some other associate can live with Miss Eustacia.
Unless... either of you wants it?
Uh, the captain didn't send me, in case you were wondering.
He told you we had it out.
He told me that you were worried that you were gonna hurt his career.
That's right.
Look, you made a mistake ten years ago, and you paid for it.
You really don't think other cops are gonna see it the same way he does?
You consult for him, right?
I'm not a cop, if that's what you're asking.
Well, uh, y-you know, you coming here, it's very sweet, but you're talking about something you don't understand.
Then please explain it to me.
I've worked for the captain for a long time.
He stuck his neck out for me and my partner more times than I can count.
If he says he can take the heat for you, he will.
I'm surprised you don't know that about him already.
Unless there's some other reason you're calling it quits.
I'd like you to leave now.
He's one of the best guys that I know.
Whatever it is, you should tell him the truth.
Nice place.
They confirmed everything he told Marcus and me.
Included in that quagmire is a deal she was about to make involving an old friend of ours, William Hull.
Every building in the city comes with a finite amount of air rights, limiting the space that one can build up, hmm?
So Hull needed Rosalyn's air rights.
Not just hers-- those of every other building on the block.
And since the law requires that air rights only be sold across adjacent lots, the loss of her rights means he'll never be able to get the rest of the block's.
You think whoever killed Rosalyn did it to stop Hull's project from moving forward.
I'd like to ask Mr. Hull about his thoughts on the matter, who's behind it.
The detectives.
We know you're having a tough day with Rosalyn Graham's murder.
We just wanted a few minutes of your time.
You misunderstand.
We believe that Rosalyn Graham was murdered specifically to hinder your project.
So as much as it pains me to say it, we're on the same side.
Straight lines hurt you as a child?
Everyone's a critic.
- So, what is your next step?
Is the building definitely dead?
That's what today's meeting was to discuss.
Maybe we can get the rights another way.
Maybe we can find an alternative site.
Maybe I cut a deal with the city to give me the rights if I offer to build an opera house uptown.
The project is that important to you, is it?
Long after we're gone, people will look around out there, and they'll see me.
We had an incident outside on the street.
Save the West Side was protesting, and their leader hit one of my employees with a picket sign.
Charges weren't pressed, but after that, we just sent everything we ever got from them to security.
"Your building is a modernist nightmare."
Mmm. "A blight that must be stopped at all costs."
You didn't think threats from a violent protestor merited mention?
Honestly, I forgot about it.
Run-ins with neighborhood groups always come up during a project like this.
They just don't want another Starbucks on their corner.
According to Mr. O'Neal's address here, your building would have completely obstructed his Central Park view.
How much would the loss of his view affect the value of his property?
A million dollars?
That might've meant more to him than a new Starbucks.
Uh, we're looking for Save the West Side.
Well, no announcement's been made in the news yet, and here you are, closing your doors.
Are you saying that we won?
Well, now, we're sorry for the intrusion.
Condolences on your loss.
Members of his group found him the next morning, stab wound to the chest, few thousand dollars worth of computers gone, so detectives who caught it thought it was a robbery gone wrong.
So unless the thief robbed an investment banker on his way to kill O'Neal...
You think his murder had something to do with Hull's building?
Do we think there's any connection between his murder and Rosalyn Graham's?
They both had ties to the building that was supposed to go up.
But on the surface, the murders have opposing motives.
Rosalyn's murder will in all likelihood doom the project, which is exactly what O'Neal wanted.
A single theory to explain both homicides has yet to present itself.
Watson and I will keep our focus on Rosalyn's murder.
As evidenced by the hate mail we took from Busquet's office, the building had no shortage of detractors.
We can also check the city council minutes, public records, see if anyone else spoke out against it.
Well, let me know what you find.
Because what we need is more paperwork to look through.
Oh, did you know that in a building without fire sprinklers, the maximum travel distance to stairwells needs to be 150 feet, but in a building with sprinklers, it can be 200?
Well, it seems rude to make evacuees run an additional 50 feet whilst also getting wet, but I assume that's not your point.
My point is I'm gonna tear my hair out.
Not a damn thing.
There isn't, but I could just tell there was something more.
Have you shared those insights with the captain?
This is weird.
Derek O'Neal spoke at a city council meeting a few months ago.
You think there was a mole inside Hull's organization who was secretly feeding information to O'Neal?
The description was enough to I.D. the person.
Mr. Reem admitted to us he'd been selling inside information to Derek O'Neal.
He said you personally caught him copying files after hours one night.
That was Thursday, one day before O'Neal was killed.
This is ridiculous.
You think I killed this guy O'Neal over a few files?
They would have become public record anyway in a matter of weeks.
Perhaps it contained evidence that you bribed a public official.
Perhaps you were cutting corners on safety codes.
We don't think O'Neal knew what he had, or he would have used it against you.
Whatever it was, we're guessing you couldn't just leave it out in the world.
The information in those files, it was nuisance stuff.
But there was nothing in there that broke the law and certainly nothing even remotely worth killing over.
Those files contain proprietary and confidential information.
He might have got rid of them already, but, uh, his credit card statements might help.
I'll take this to the captain, see what he thinks.
My friend at the Department of Buildings has important information to share.
What are you doing here?
Way to make a girl feel welcome.
I'm sorry, but this is literally the last place I thought I'd see you.
Do you want, uh... do you want some water or coffee?
I told you I thought my past could hurt you, but there's more to it than that, and you deserve to hear it.
Am I about to get the "It's not you, it's me" speech?
It is me.
Your friend Joan stopped by the shop, and... she knew I was hiding something.
What are you talking about?
I have MS.
I was diagnosed two months ago, and I didn't know how to tell you, so...
I haven't been worried about what I'll do to your career.
I've been worried about what I'll do to the rest of your life.
Paige.
Eventually, this disease is gonna get ugly.
And I was using the job as an excuse because... you're a good man.
And you don't deserve to be stuck with what's coming.
So... that's it.
I don't get a say in this?
Good-bye, Tommy.
These materials represent a fundamental shift in our perception of the case.
So you got all this from your friend at the Department of Buildings?
Some of it.
His important news was that William Hull put out a press release earlier today.
The magnate has got his wish.
Or, more accurately, under it.
This is the image which accompanied today's announcement.
The original is 63, this one is 40.
So they used the air rights they could get to build a shorter building, and they already have completed plans?
That seems fast.
These are plans for the building Busquet's office is in.
These, however, were on file with the city, and my contact graciously supplied them.
These are the files that were leaked to Derek O'Neal's office.
So you got the plans to Busquet's building, and used them to break into his office so that you could resteal the plans to Hull's building that were leaked.
Succinctly put.
We've been thinking that Derek O'Neal was killed to protect the building and that Rosalyn Graham was killed to block it.
I now believe that both murders were the work of the same killer, who intended to shrink it.
I was told the captain of Major Crimes needed to see me.
Yes, he's gonna join us in a little while, but for now, we wanted to keep things informal.
Do I need an attorney present?
Are you a criminal?
You remember the Mars Orbital mishap of 1999?
Where the satellite burned up upon contact with the Martian atmosphere?
Am I somehow responsible for that?
The point is, small miscalculations can have big consequences.
An acquaintance of ours looked over the plans for your building.
He found that your architect, Mr. Busquet-- or, perhaps, someone in his team-- made an error in their wind calculations.
In short, at 63 stories, the building would've been structurally unsound.
Anything stronger than a stiff breeze, and it would've come tumbling down.
And you're saying that you think Busquet knew about this?
We think he discovered the mistake, but by then, things were too far along to pull the plug.
And you yourself called this building a "legacy maker."
So he killed Rosalyn Graham to tie up her estate-- and air rights-- in legal battles.
Derek O'Neal's murder was likely not planned.
I swear, I had no idea.
Yeah, well, your reputation for litigation precedes you.
Had Busquet ever told you about his cock-up, you'd have sued him blind.
So then why I am I here?
The police have a sample of what we think is the killer's blood.
With a warrant, we can compel Busquet to provide a DNA sample.
The problem is, everything we just told you was from us seeing a report that was not acquired in a way that would stand up in court.
Now, from here, things can proceed in two ways.
You "give" us all the materials you see here before you, which, as the property developer, you rightfully own.
So which scenario do you think's better?
She told you that I went to see her.
She has MS.
That's why she was pushing me away.
It gets bad.
With a... doctor.
It could take years... or months.
And once the disease really takes hold, she's gonna need a lot of help.
Well... she's worth it.
Your friends are gonna be there for you.
Previously on "Criminal Minds"...
Woman, you are driving me crazy, you know that?
Time to die.
Mommy!
Oh, my dance card's kind of full these days, Rossi, you know, getting ready for a baby.
Well, that's all the more reason to play, you know, jump-start the kid's college fund with a little money.
You sure about that?
Let's have it.
Have what?
All right, look, I'm not saying, but I was supposed to distract you, so do me a favor and act surprised when you go in there, all right?
All right, I got you covered.
And let's just keep it an extra 30 seconds, just to be sure.
Oh, you look like a diaper changer to me.
Yes, you will be changing some diapers.
Ladies, I was joking, I was joking.
Yeah, we're on the way.
Uh, I'll go let the others know.
Both parents' eyes were filled with sand and glued shut.
Mr. Sandman, bring me a nightmare.
This is a well organized unsub.
He managed to kill both parents, perform a complicated ritual, and successfully abduct the boy.
I mean, wouldn't it be simpler just to grab the kid on the way to school?
Well, the abduction of the child from a place of presumed safety must be an essential part of his ritual.
The sealing of the eyes could indicate remorse.
I mean, he must have a reason for rendering the parents functionally blind first.
You know, the sand in the eyes could be a purely symbolic gesture.
The Sandman was a mythical character who would sprinkle magic dust in the eyes of children while they slept.
Yeah, but I thought he was a benevolent figure, a bringer of good dreams.
All right, when we land, Dave, you and JJ go to the crime scene.
Reid and Lewis to the M.E., and Morgan and I will get set up at the precinct.
An AMBER alert has been issued and police checkpoints have been established here, here, and here.
I understand a witness saw a vehicle leaving the area about the time of the murders?
He reported seeing a white male in a gray sedan speeding away.
Well, this is a small agricultural community.
If the killer stalked the Brewer family beforehand, someone may have noticed.
Or he could be a seasonal worker with no local connections.
Which would be our worst-case scenario, someone who came from nowhere and is now headed back to nowhere.
No tread marks anywhere, the unsub probably parked his car along the main road and walked in,
And I bet the Brewers probably never locked their front door.
You know, that's not so unusual.
I grew up in a place like this and that's just how it was.
Lyla Brewer's body was found in the hallway.
Eliminate the primary threat before moving on to mother and child.
Mrs. Brewer spent some time stumbling around out here.
And in the child's bedroom and in the bathroom and in the study.
She covered a lot of ground before dying.
There are, uh, fresh scratches on the floor here.
Too heavy for her to have moved.
What if the unsub did it to block the top of the stairs?
Seal off the child's escape, maybe?
Or prevent a blinded Mrs. Brewer from taking a fall?
So do we have a C.O.D. on the victims?
Mr. Brewer's was massive blood loss from a severed trachea, most likely a thin-bladed serrated knife.
It's highly unusual for a killer to use different weapons on different victims.
Speaking of unusual, take a look.
Corneal tissue samples from the eyes of each victim.
Mr. Brewer's on the left and Mrs. Brewer's on the right.
Plain English--his eyes didn't react to the glue.
Plainer English-- he was already dead when it happened.
No known enemies.
What about registered sex offenders in the area?
There's over a thousand in Wichita alone.
Garcia's checking them out.
Prairie Creek Road, a few miles from the crime scene.
The description matches Ronnie Brewer.
I recognize him from the family photos.
Body temperature and state of rigor indicates that he's been dead 7 to 8 hours.
Well, maybe the compulsion is about the pursuit of the child rather than the child itself.
Well, if that's the case, he's gonna try again soon, with someone else.
Josie!
That's what you said 20 minutes ago.
I want your homework done before dinner.
I just talked to the M.E. Ronnie Brewer died from asphyxiation but had not been sexually assaulted.
Unless strangling the boy was the sexual release.
Or it could have been the unsub's first abduction and he panicked, disposed of the child immediately once he had him.
The M.E. also said that the type of glue in the Brewers' eyes is frequently used for surgical closures, so the drying process on the skin in well documented.
Apparently it had been applied at 5:15 am.
Well, the farm hand said they saw that gray sedan flee the scene at 6:20, so if that was our unsub, what was he doing in the house for that hour?
All Josie ever does is stare at that phone.
Girls her age should be out doing things.
What's so funny?
The glue our unsub used is sold practically everywhere, so we can't isolate point of purchase.
A mineral analysis from the sand, however, indicates that it came from the Seneca River in upstate New York.
You ok?
Yeah.
Morgan, we're gonna find the people who tried to kill you.
He was in his pajamas.
Ronnie Brewer.
Out there by the side of the road, he was still in his pajamas.
I don't think that's what this is.
Then what is it?
It just feels so hard.
Like pavement.
If there's one thing I'm sure of, is that you and Savannah are going to be great parents.
Oh, my God.
No, she just went into surgery.
I saw an alarm panel by the front door.
It wasn't activated, but it did keep the computerized log of all home activity.
Family have any other children?
Just Josie, the missing daughter.
And Ronnie Brewer wasn't sexually assaulted, so we may not be dealing with a pedophile.
We're looking for a family annihilator.
We believe he's a white male in his early to mid-30s.
He is intelligent, well organized, and meticulous.
Family annihilators are often quick and ruthless, but this unsub prolongs the suffering of his victims.
He appears to kill in stages.
First the father, then the mother, and finally the child.
The mother seems to be the primary target of the unsub's rage.
She is forced to endure a sense of helplessness for upwards of an hour while her child is in danger.
So we're dealing with a sadist?
Yes, but not sadism as we typically think of it.
The sadism is psychological.
Something may have happened in the unsub's childhood where he felt unprotected.
Perhaps his own mother turned a blind eye to a real or perceived danger.
And this could explain the ritual of placing sand and glue in the parents' eyes, symbolically blinding them as punishment.
Ellie Zumwalt survived her injuries, and this may discourage this unsub and make him more cautious.
Residents in remote or rural areas and families with an only child should exercise extreme caution in the coming days.
Still no sign of Josie Zumwalt.
And we scoured every inch of road in a 10-mile radius.
Well, either she's still alive or the unsub did a much better job of body concealment this time.
If he did kill her, why deviate from his previous disposal method?
My gut says he's still holding her.
But why her and not the Brewer boy?
Look at the mantel.
Could be a recent purchase or they might have moved it there from some other place in the house.
Except we know the unsub spends an hour at each crime scene.
It's Hotch.
Ellie Zumwalt is out of surgery and awake.
Thank you.
We appreciate you talking to us, Mrs. Zumwalt.
We know this is a difficult time.
My husband is dead, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
What about Josie?
Is my daughter all right?
I woke up, but my eyes wouldn't open.
Josie kept screaming.
And every time I went to where I thought she was, the scream came from somewhere else.
We realize you couldn't see well, but could you make out any features about this man?
No.
He--he wore something on his face.
Did he speak?
Only at the end.
Eleven.
Police found this in your living room.
What you got, baby girl?
What I've got is fail, fail, and more fail.
Remember Thomas Alva Edison, Penelope.
Ok, let me rephrase what I just said.
I'm currently waist-deep in what is not working.
Something must connect our unsub to the Seneca River.
All the sand in the world right here and this guy brings dirt from 1,500 miles away.
We're talking topnotch museum quality, but not by any artisan known in the high-end glass-blowing community, and yes, there is such a thing as the high-end glass-blowing community.
They're analyzing the sand from both hourglasses now to see if it matches what was put in the victims' eyes.
So far no prints or DNA.
You know, obviously give or take a few.
Skill level off the charts, yet his work is unknown.
Mineral analysis just came in on the hourglass sand.
Also from upstate New York?
No, it's local.
What's the matter, Sergeant?
It's what they found next to him in the sand.
Human bone and tooth enamel.
I got this list.
There are certain things that should never exist, and one of those is this depressingly long list.
Aside from the horribleness of it all, no.
Why are you doing this?
I don't want to go in there!
I want to go home!
It could be some sort of countdown.
What are you thinking, Aaron?
It was the gradual loss of blood that caused her to lose consciousness.
I don't think there was a mistake.
What do you mean?
To me that sounds like mission accomplished.
We didn't understand why he used two different murder weapons on Jim and Lyla Brewer.
The victim was blinded, hardwood floors slippery with blood.
She could have fallen and hit her head on a blunt object.
That's what we need to figure out.
Josie's fate depends on it.
Patrick Sorenson of Oswego, New York.
He was on Garcia's list of potential victims.
Abducted by a pedophile in 1993 when he was 9, raised by a single mother with substance abuse problems.
A mother who was literally asleep at the wheel when the boy was taken.
She was passed out drunk in her car parked behind their house.
The boy said he screamed for help, but the mom never came.
Patrick went into the foster care system and moved back to Oswego, where he lived quietly up until 6 weeks ago, when he vanished without a trace.
It says here Patrick told authorities he got through the assault by focusing on sand."
His attacker made him stare at an hourglass while the abuse went on.
He was told that if he didn't cry until all the sand emptied out, he wouldn't be killed.
So the trauma of the assault was fused with the image of an hourglass.
And launched an obsession with time, so much so that he went on to build devices that measure it with extraordinary mathematical precision.
He was telling her the amount of time that he himself had been held in captivity.
Josie was taken at 4:30 this morning, which means we have until 3:30 this afternoon.
I don't understand.
Because he needs to hear you express how sorry you are for what happened.
You're really talking to the man who took her.
Well, how do we know he'll be watching?
My team's coordinating with local media to get the word out.
He'll be watching.
And if I do this, then he'll let Josie go?
There's a chance, yes.
Word just in from a local hospital that Ellie Zumwalt, recovering from injuries suffered in the latest attack on local families, is going to speak to the public within an hour.
We don't know what this unexpected statement will be, but concern is rising for the hours passed with no word on her abducted daughter.
Come on, Penelope, think.
Patrick Sorenson didn't just vanish into thin air.
There's gotta be some way that he...
That must have been the trigger.
That's when he dropped off the map in New York.
Yeah, and if he was holding out hope for answers from that mother one day, that hope was suddenly gone.
Garcia, did Betty Sorenson own any property in the Wichita area?
Nope, she lived in a studio apartment.
She was held in the morgue, Patrick was called to identify her body, but he never showed up.
I guess she's still there?
All right, I'll check it out.
We're recording.
This is a message for my child.
If you can hear me, sweetheart, please listen carefully.
There's something I need to tell you.
I've been a bad mother, and I did a terrible thing to let this happen to you.
It's all my fault.
You deserve better than this.
You deserve so much more.
I promise I will explain to you once and for all why I did what I did.
Pretty sad.
You live your life and you end up like unclaimed baggage.
Hotch, we solved the mystery of the bone fragments in the hourglass.
Patrick was going to have that reunion with his mother, one way or another.
Hauling a corpse through the front door would tend to perk up the neighbors.
Well, if there was an 11-hour clock on Josie Zumwalt, the bell just rang.
What?
He's not gonna let me.
What's this area like, Sergeant?
Mostly blue-collar residential.
That's where the old railroad spur line used to come into town.
Mostly just abandoned structures out there now.
There.
I've been a bad mother.
I have an addiction.
You're so much stronger than I am.
All right, I see you and raise you 10 bucks.
The retired marine general of Mr. Rock and Roll hall of fame over here.
All right, I think both of y'all are bluffing.
Ok, I don't know if you're ready what I got right here.
Oh, I think we're ready.
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, it actually works.
Gentlemen, seriously, this has been a pleasure.
Don't hurt yourselves tonight, all right?
"Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through.
There's, uh, one more thing.
Garcia, she asked me about a week ago, who the godparents were gonna be, as in, hello, like I'm right here, like right in front of you.
May have to be.
- Werewolf?
- Their organs was ripped clean out.
We don't use the "W" word around here.
Break some hearts, then you eat 'em.
Just ugh.
Dean, we'll get him back.
We're gonna save Cass, we're gonna ice the devil, and we're gonna shank the Darkness.
What, you got some kind of death wish or something?
You're the one who's always wanted to go out blaze of glory style.
I couldn't live with you dead.
It's your time to go, Dean.
Now, if it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna save you.
I'm just gonna make sure that when you die you stay dead.
How's it going over there?
Yeah, I-I think so.
No, no, it's a -- it's a case.
All right, well, we make a call and we put somebody on it.
We'll get him back.
How?
Baby, you still with me?
Hey, Dean, they, uh...
Okay, just hold tight, you two, okay?
All right, listen, we got to get that bullet out of there, okay?
I got it.
W-What were they?
Werewolves.
Told you they were monsters.
I thought werewolves needed nighttime, a full moon?
We've been here for days.
These guys, they can change any time.
Yeah, that's 'cause they were probably purebloods.
Those wrists -- Those wrists are infected.
You good, you good?
Is there a landline in here?
You don't have a cellphone?
Yeah, no, I know.
Just a couple scratches.
Hey, we're coming!
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, we can't stay here, not with the others still out there.
Others?
All right, look... we know we're in the right place.
I've tried all the big landmarks outside of the park -- the police station, the -- the -- the fleabag motel we're staying in, this bar.
You know what I was thinking?
You boys should check out one of the easement cabins.
Some of your missing could be in one of them.
Do you mind, um, showing us about where they are?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Right about there.
No, nothing yet.
Hey, look at that.
Anything?
No, it's dead.
I got matches over here.
I'm gonna light those up.
Those of us who -- who can.
It's three lives versus one.
Dean... he's right.
You guys need to -- to go.
It's only a couple of miles.
I thought we trained you boys up right.
I warned you they were coming, all but served them up to you on a platter.
Now what?
Get off me!
He won't leave you.
And we won't last out there without him.
I'm sorry.
Corbin?
We got to go.
It's them.
No, you can't!
I'm gonna come back for you, okay?
I promise.
Damn it!
All right, so, I think if we head in that way, should be about a four-mile trek to the cabin.
Yeah, that part.
Oh, come on.
Hey, what happened back there?
Talk to me.
I saved us.
I can't lose you.
Hey, first, everyone is gonna settle down and tell me what the hell is going on.
Don't try to move if you can help it.
You got a couple broken ribs I haven't tended to yet.
That, and what is probably... a nasty concussion.
And we ran.
Werewolves.
We don't know what their deal was.
Only what that guy told us.
"That guy" saved us, and so did his brother.
Thank you for your time.
Your wife's been through a lot.
I'll give a call to the rangers, have them check out the cabin and the station, then I'll let you know what they find.
Michelle... we made it.
What did this?
Come on, Charlie, pick up.
Sure.
I-I just wanted to see how you were doing.
You saved our lives and...
She used to say... death -- it's not the end.
Werewolves aren't the only monsters out there.
How exactly do you talk to an evil, scary death machine?
Easy.
It has to.
If not... no hard feelings, okay?
You don't have to do this.
Yeah, I do.
Go around that side.
How do you feel?
It's in here.
What did he take?
It's the little bottle, middle shelf, and a bag of saline.
I got him.
Just savoring this.
Though I have to say of all the ways I thought you'd go -- heart attack, some fang, choking on a burger while binge-watching "Charles in Charge"...
Doesn't fit your whole martyr thing.
You know, the Darkness is out there... and the world is gonna burn.
And once she gets started, that's the end of everything, including you.
That's what I thought.
You can't lose him.
But even if Sammy could win the title bout... the answer would still be "no."
The answer will always be "no."
Game's over, Dean.
Time to say bye-bye to Luigi, Mario.
I'm here to reap you.
Come along now, Dean.
It's time.
Can we have a word outside, please?
Fine, just keep your eye on him.
I'm gonna call over to White Bird, get some backup in here.
You okay?
I really am.
I don't know.
Please, don't be scared of me.
I didn't want this.
Okay, any of this, but... it's happened and it feels so...
You'll see.
Run!
It took you long enough.
How you doing?
How's your brother?
That wasn't...
Corbin wasn't a killer.
I know.
He did it for me.
And, eventually... eventually you'll get back to normal.
No, I won't.
They said I could leave... an hour ago.
But... where am I even supposed to go?
There's no normal after that.
So, that's it, huh?
Two quarts O-neg, and you're good to go.
Those stitches gonna hold?
Oh, yeah -- uh, professional grade.
Couple days of antibiotics and some bed rest, and I'm, uh, back to normal.
Hey, so, what did you do?
Thought about redecorating your room, you know, putting in a Jacuzzi, a nice disco ball -- really class up the joint.
"Supernatural" by Carver Edlund.
What's Carver Edlund's real name?
Chuck Shurley?
He has relatives?
So, what, she shows up, and everybody goes "28 Days Later"?
He didn't feel the need to show up for the apocalypse.
He just doesn't think it's his problem.
Why would he give a crap now?
I don't know, maybe because she's his sister.
All your chosen are suffering!
What the hell is going on here?
It's not just a bar, genius, this is one of the Big Man's constructs.
Well, I wouldn't exactly say --
A limbo where I get to spend eternity in a crappy bar with a hack writer.
Sorry, Chuckles, not just any hack writer -- a Prophet of the Lord.
Give me a break.
Still, it doesn't justify you... burning one of my books, though.
You were monologuing it to Castiel, and you threw one in the fire.
I can't believe you've come back.
I-I didn't mean what I said about "Supernatural."
It's underrated -- due for a reboot.
And this bar -- it's not crappy at all.
Okay, yeah, please, all the kneeling and stuff, it's always made me deeply, deeply uncomfortable.
I think I need a stiffer drink.
Tell me you got something on Amara.
Uh, it's a long shot, but clock's ticking, right?
So, what, possession?
So, what you been up to?
Oh, I've been super busy.
A-And I started a new series of books.
Yeah. "Revolution."
But I don't think it's going anywhere.
Maybe titles aren't your thing.
But why did you put on the Chuck suit in the first place?
How did that make any sense to you?
I like front-row seats.
You know, I figured I'd hide out in plain sight.
You know, plus, you know, acting is fun.
Well...it's an Oscar-worthy performance.
But...how did nobody know?
I mean, w-what about that amulet thingy?
Y-You told me about it, some... silly charm that burned brightly in the presence of you.
You'll never guess where this thing has been this entire time.
Look, I don't care about that ugly old thing or why you were slumming it with the plebes.
You know what an absolute piece of garbage I've been the last couple of years.
Even I couldn't have dreamt up that deliciousness.
But music... is magic.
A lot of remarkable music was created in this space.
B.G.'s Canteen.
Now, it's not as well-known as the Bitter End or the Gaslight, but some amazing musicians got their start on this stage.
I'm hoping that you and I can tap into some of that old magic and finish what I started a few months ago.
Ish.
I mean, there are chapters, it's kind of a loose structure, uh, but, I don't know, something's missing.
You want to get the old band back together.
Lennon and McCartney ride again.
I did some of my best work with you, Metatron.
Appreciate the FBI taking an interest in this case.
We don't really see things like this around here.
Hey, you mind if I knock off, Sheriff?
Let me guess -- Art's back?
Newlyweds.
You can head home after you show Agent Greer the M.E. files.
I talked to his friends, family.
Nobody can make heads or tails of why he did this.
We have a witness who overheard Wes before he took his own life.
He was saying things that sounded out of character.
She loved Wes till the day she died.
I've actually seen something like that before.
Deputy, tell me, have you noticed any strange phenomena around town?
Uh, sulfur smells or power outages?
Maybe an unexplained fog?
No, sir.
It's always sunny in Hope Springs.
At least, it used to be.
Are you in a hurry or something?
I'm on a bit of a deadline.
I mean, I'm hooked, and I was there.
I'm hooked, too, and yet... details.
You weren't alone in the beginning.
Your sister was with you.
I assume you're aware that she's... out and about.
Tanned, rested, and ready.
I mean, that's why you're back, right?
That follow you in from town?
Honey, you want to head inside while I call this in?
It's just fog.
Hey, you know I'm the law, right?
See you inside, Deputy.
Don't forget your cuffs.
Aren't you done for today, Deputy?
We expecting any weather like that?
No, it's supposed to be clear skies all night.
That bad?
I'll tell you, there's some great bones in there.
I'm thinking what's missing -- maybe less about detail and more about balance.
Like that chapter about being Chuck.
Yeah, they're super cute.
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
You are neither grounded nor a person!
Like what?
I mean, you have got maybe two paragraphs on them in here.
And that's it!
Don't you think they deserve a few extra words?
Especially your favorite -- Lucifer?
You trusted him with the mark.
He rebelled!
And in doing so, kind of wrecked Christmas.
Okay, all that's in there.
Except the -- the bit about Christmas.
If you say that Amara is off limits, fine.
But you know every great hero is defined by his or her villain.
Lucifer was not a villain.
Okay.
Safest place ever created.
Truth and fairy tale.
Then you've got some work to do.
There are no revelations in this book!
And that's weird, given who you are.
There's no new information, no soul-bearing.
That's because I don't have a soul.
Try shining a light on that.
How did that make you feel?
And I get it -- when you were on Earth, you had to go full method.
Well, it's time for you to get back into character.
This is me.
Really?
And yes, he could be a dick.
Now, that guy... had some stories to tell.
And he has a lot to answer for.
Okay, so what do I do?
Hold up a mirror and show us who you are.
Warts and all.
Write for an audience of one -- you.
Dance like no one else is watching.
Richards or Wilson, Chuck?
Richards -- all the way.
Just, uh, why don't you tell us what happened here?
Harris didn't show up for work this morning.
We called, tried her CB, nothing.
Did you notice anything off about Deputy Harris' behavior the last couple days?
I don't know why she cared about the damn weather.
Yeah, just to be safe.
"Chapter 10 -- Why I Never Answer Prayers, and You Should Be Glad I Don't."
And chapter 11 -- "The Truth About Divine intervention and Why I Avoid It at All Costs."
Better, right?
Kind of angry with a side of bitter, but, hey, it's real.
Now... not to overstep my bounds, but since you're on a roll, there's one thing that I've always wondered.
Maybe it will make a good chapter, maybe even a whole book.
You created worlds.
I was stupid.
Maybe she'd stop... being...her.
But... every time I'd build a new world... she'd destroy it.
Tried to, anyway.
But... this was as close as I got to something as good as or better than me or my sister.
The National Park system?
Start over fresh on the B-side.
If Amara wipes the slate, the slate's destroyed.
Everything is destroyed.
I can't make heads or tails.
Harris is... was our computer person.
Can I give it a shot?
Did they say where it was headed?
West towards town.
Okay, call them back, tell them to get inside, shut their windows or doors and seal it up, and stay the hell away from that fog.
My partner and I have seen this before, okay?
No, it sounds like we should call the CDC.
She's on Main Street, heading right this way.
All right, we'll handle Harris.
Hey, get them out of here.
She has a message -- for you, Dean Winchester.
Did she tell you to kill your husband?
And I watched myself do it.
Okay, listen to me, this is an infection.
She says it's a mirror.
She's showing us all the truth.
Darkness.
The light was just a lie.
It will all be over soon.
He's not gonna save them.
It's all going away... forever.
They do like blowing stuff up.
And then they come crying to me, asking me to forgive, to fix things.
At a certain point, training wheels got to come off.
She's your sister.
I took responsibility for her, too.
Locked her away -- barely, I might add.
And who let her out?
Sam and Dean Winchester, but they're trying to fix that.
You know I love those guys, but the world would still be spinning with Demon Dean in it.
But Sam couldn't have that, though, could he?
I've rebuilt Castiel more times than I can remember.
Look where that got me.
No, I think it's stupid to write a book nobody is gonna be around to read!
You told me to write for an audience of one -- me.
And I think we're finally getting somewhere.
You started writing the second she came back, didn't you?
No wonder you're on a deadline!
Now I understand why you're masquerading in that sad little meat suit!
For the same reason you created this nostalgic bar to write your masterpiece in -- you're hiding!
I just like the ambiance in here.
You know, I was a crappy, terrible god.
My work was pretty much a lame, half-assed rewrite of your greatest hits.
But at least I was never a coward.
I remember the first time I saw you.
All the angels were terrified, but I wasn't.
The feeling of your light was... was just beyond measure.
And then the unthinkable.
You picked me to help you with your tablets.
You were just the closest angel to the door when I walked into the room.
There's nothing special about you, Metatron.
Not then... not now.
But coward...
I am not hiding.
I am just done watching my experiments' failures.
You mean your failures, Chuck.
You have any duct tape?
Sheriff, let's see if we can't fix that radio of yours.
You hear that?
My God, he's infected.
Everybody, get inside!
You know, you really are a terrific editor, Metatron.
That was just a sad, pathetic cry for attention.
You are light... and beauty.
Damnation and salvation.
And I don't care if I was just the angel nearest the door.
You picked me.
Your light shined on me -- me!
Oh, and the warmth.
And so did I -- every day.
I know.
They are your greatest creation because they're better than you are.
And above all, they never give up.
No, I'm not leaving you -- ever!
I did the same when I "learned" French.
Man, this whole honesty thing -- it's really freeing.
You know you want to.
I think I'll pass.
I think you're really gonna like them.
Where you going?
To see the child that eats souls.
It's the only reason I came off the sidelines.
Where on earth are we gonna find an answer on how to stop her?
The hand of God.
To where?
I don't know.
So, what Amara said about you...
Okay, well, t-tell us how to fix you.
I-I-I suppose she could, maybe, but that's never gonna happen.
So that was a gun in your pocket.
Well... that was a complete and utter dog's breakfast, wasn't it?
I didn't know dogs had breakfast.
Cass is back.
Just curious -- has anyone bothered to look outside?
What is it?
Why would Amara do that?
The sun is the source of all life on earth.
Without it, everything just... just wastes away.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Still got a few tricks up my sleeve.
Really?
Really.
That's right.
But how are we supposed to fix the friggin' sun?
Thank you, Reggie.
Of course, milady.
We have registered a 6% drop in the sun's energy output, and yes, it happened quite suddenly, but people need to understand -- our sun goes through periods of high activity and low activity.
If only.
The bloody sun's cracked.
Yes, sir.
On my way.
Charles, I'll put the kettle on.
My mom always said, there's nothing a nice wee cup of tea can't fix.
Teapot?
She's been...nice.
For now.
I'm not calling you Dad.
You don't want to say goodbye.
It's easier this way.
Tell him I'll be home as soon as I can.
Packed you a little something, just if all your mumbo jumbo doesn't work.
He'd run 'round the village, his wee banger just flapping in the breeze.
Adam and Eve were the same way.
I'm so glad the world is ending.
Samantha!
That's my better idea, because anything is better than this.
Even if we could lock Amara away, it wouldn't do any good now.
I'm dying.
And when I'm gone, a cosmic balance between light and dark -- it's over.
Then if we can't cage her, we have to kill her.
I mean, you know, the whole Lucifer thing.
Well, it didn't work.
No, but it was our best shot, and you stepped up.
I was just trying to help.
Well, you do live exciting lives.
Yeah, that's one word for it.
But you're always there, you know?
You're the best friend we've ever had.
Sam's got something.
Wait, so now you want to kill the Darkness?
So, we don't really have a choice.
Is she, Chuck?
Well, y-you're God.
Okay, Crowley?
Oh, I got nothing.
Well, what about souls?
H-He's not wrong.
Okay, so if we got this kind of juice, then what?
Even if you could get that kind of firepower... you really think it would work?
Yeah, but we would need a whole lot of them.
Waverly Hills.
Waverly Hills Sanatorium.
Well, desperate and stupid's pretty much all we got right now, so...
Let's get to work.
Just say the magic word.
Place really lives up to the hype.
Yes, it does.
Let's give the magic word a shot, because we're six.
Get your Casper asses out here!
You know what?
Okay, I think it worked!
The angels are -- Heaven won't help.
While I was indisposed, a few of my demonic pals decided to raid my stash.
Well, what we have -- it's not enough.
Well, that could be nothing but good news.
Nice digs.
Wants us dead.
Tons of fun.
Dead folks -- kind of my thing.
So... spill.
We're collecting souls to build a bomb.
To blow the Darkness to hell.
So you're here to help us.
Little tip -- you want souls, call a reaper.
Oh, I like your dress.
It's pretty fancy for the park, but at least you made an effort.
Do you want to feed them?
I shouldn't.
I've been feeding these birds going on 20 years now.
They're practically family.
And I know that makes me sound like a crazy old bat, but...heck.
My husband died a couple of years ago, and my son keeps slipping me these brochures for retirement communities -- a.k.a. where they send old folks to die, but not to make a fuss about it.
So you hate him.
Well, this is exciting.
How many souls are in there?
A couple hundred...thousand.
I raided the Veil.
Like I said, dead folks -- kind of my thing.
We good?
Very.
Super.
Just hope it's not today.
So, what now?
She's not warded anymore.
Okay, so?
We need somebody to get close to her, someone with a... personal connection.
Well, what are we waiting for?
You won't carry the bomb.
You'll be the bomb.
I'm gonna take what's in there... and put it in here.
Once you get close to her, you press your fingers together like so -- boom.
Dean, are you okay?
How do you feel?
Like my insides just got flame-broiled.
Is that normal?
Sweetie, we're so far past normal.
You've got about an hour, maybe a wee bit more, then you're literally a walking ticking time bomb.
Dean, you know, you don't have to do this.
'Course I do.
I can do that, okay?
I can do that.
You know, if this works, um, that bomb goes off.
I know.
You cool with this?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, you love chick flicks.
He's not wrong.
Your round, Moose.
How did you find me?
Does it matter?
I'm here to give you what you want.
Me.
That's a change.
Well, I can't just stand by and watch the world, my friends, and my family die.
So if becoming a part of you takes me away from that, then I'm in.
You... and that bomb in your chest?
Do you think I can't taste the power coming off of you?
I don't have a choice.
With my brother getting weaker, the scales are tipping away from light.
And into darkness.
Into nothing.
When God's gone, the universe -- everything will cease to exist.
Including me.
And while law enforcement is telling people not to panic, residents are being advised to stay in their homes as authorities are baffled by this st--
Boring.
He looks horrible.
My brother betrayed me.
He locked me away for billions of years.
Oh, aces.
No!
I just wanted to hurt him.
I've been there.
Me and Sam -- we have had our fair share of fights -- more than our share -- but no matter how bad it got, we always made it right because we're family.
Now you might be a -- an all-powerful being... but I think you're human where it counts.
You simply need your brother.
Just stop.
But deep down, you didn't really want me... 'cause I'm not him.
Maybe if I pull this trigger, we all live happily ever after, or maybe we die bloody, or maybe it doesn't matter, because maybe there's a different way.
You know, we, um... we need you to try and hang in there just a little longer.
In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.
I did.
I do.
But then you went and you made all these other things.
And then you locked me away, and all I could think about was making you suffer.
You had your reasons.
I did.
What you've made... it's beautiful.
It took me a long time to see that.
I know that we can't go back to the way things were.
I don't want to, but I wish...
I wish that we could just be family again.
I do too.
He did it.
He bloody did it.
But first...
Better?
What about us?
What about Earth?
Earth will be fine.
It's got you... and Sam.
Dean, you gave me what I needed most.
I want to do the same for you.
Sam, I'm so sorry.
Don't.
What you've done, the damage you've caused -- archangels, Leviathans, the Darkness, and now, well -- the old men have decided enough's enough.
Previously on Homeland...
A word in your ear about the president-elect.
Stop the bad advice.
She doesn't realize we're facing an existential threat.
You are Farhad Nafisi, a member of the Iranian delegation.
Your main purpose here is to negotiate an illegal arms deal on behalf of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.
- I need a straight answer.
In the apartment across the street, somebody is watching.
I saw, by the window, there are these small holes in the carpet.
I'm telling you, he flat out refused.
- Delete the recording.
- What do you want?
Sekou Bah cleared and released by tomorrow morning, or this goes to the Attorney General.
What is it?
What did you expect would happen?
What did you expect would happen if you let down your guard, if you announce to the world the terrorist threat has passed?
Oh, they're all in Raqqa, or wherever, bringin' on the end of the world over there with their goats!
If you stop pushing back against them here, every minute, if you are that stupid, what do you get?
Madame President-elect, I hope you're listening, and if you are, hear me now.
Most people weren't at work yet.
So we got lucky.
I just spent two years telling the country not to over-react every time we hear a bang.
This was a lot more than a bang.
- I feel like a deserter.
We'll have cammies and automatic weapons on parade all over Midtown.
Fine.
Go.
Standing here at the site of what is certainly the most destructive incident in New York City since 9/11.
There are two confirmed dead and many more wounded, according to initial reports.
Franny, you've seen enough of that, okay?
People died.
Because you are safe and I'm safe.
- Is Quinn?
Franny needs to get her backpack ready for school.
I was afraid you weren't picking up.
I got a call from the FBI to meet them at our office, and they showed up with warrants.
Did you hear me?
Yeah, I-I heard.
Mom!
Uh, look in your room, honey!
- Carrie?
Apparently there's security cam footage they haven't made public yet of the truck, just before it blew.
Well, I can't right now.
You've got to.
His mother and his sister are being interrogated by the FBI.
We need to make sure they don't get themselves in trouble.
The whole city is on lockdown.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Baa, 'cause he's a sheep, obviously.
Blue 'cause he's blue.
Do you like rabbits?
Yes, I do.
There's a famous rabbit called Peter, like me.
Peter Rabbit.
Well, hello.
Can I talk to him?
Something wrong?
Her school is closed, and I've got a crisis at work.
I reached the nanny, but she won't be here for 45 minutes.
You want me to babysit till she gets here?
I'm not a baby!
Would you?
It shouldn't be long.
How do I talk to him in the meantime?
Communications are still in process.
My son.
So we both think he couldn't have done it by himself.
That's not what I said.
- I said he didn't do it.
He must have been talking to someone.
Just that skeezy informant that you sicced on him.
Come with me.
She's not saying another word without a lawyer.
Your client just set off a bomb in Manhattan.
I've got meetings this afternoon all the way up to the director, and all anyone will want to know is how that shitbag who we had in lockup got released to the streets.
So, what are you gonna tell them?
Everything, including how you used a recording between me and my informant to get your bomber released.
So I need to know-- That recording.
Pretty much had to come from NSA.
I told you, I can't say!
Imagine that hundreds of people are dead in Manhattan right now.
And then ask yourself why you're still wasting time fucking with me.
You're not wanted.
Okay, pay attention.
Nine potato-- nine potato, ten potato.
Now you try.
One more time.
Her name is Latisha.
What can you tell us about the suicide bomber Sekou Bah?
We understand she represented him.
Who's that?
Nobody.
We're looking for Carrie Mathison.
Is that your mom?
- Of course.
I'm so important I have no phone.
My staff.
A TV so I can see what's going on.
It's being activated.
It won't be long.
Nothing for now, thanks.
It's about the bomb.
That conversation was about my client, Sekou Bah.
- Wait, what?
The recording did.
So, hey, he just walks free?
But because the recording got Sekou released, it's important evidence in the bombing investigation.
Your organization's gonna be looking internally, so it's not gonna be enough just to say that.
I filled out a contact report and I sent it up the chain.
Well, then, why are those people all mad at her?
You know you're always... safe with me, right?
Did they say why they're here?
They want to talk to Carrie.
They know she's not here, right?
I told them, but they won't go.
Well, here's what I think we should do.
Wait a second.
She's not here!
Is there anything you can tell us about him?
Just let me go, I'll leave you in peace.
- Who are you?
- Tina Meyers, RCB News.
Tell your people to get away.
They're not my people!
Tell them!
I'm thinking I should take Franny home.
She-- she is home.
With me, I mean.
Carrie said stay here.
That was before all those people showed up.
I promised.
Let's just call Carrie and see what she thinks, okay?
Not okay.
They're listening.
Madame President-elect.
You were expecting someone else.
My staff.
They'll be here as soon as possible.
I can't even talk to them.
Elevated security protocols, I know.
That's why I brought you this.
It connects via SIPRNet.
It's a start.
Please.
I'd like to bring you up to speed on the attack and a few unfortunate facts you should be aware of.
The bomber's name was Sekou Bah, an American Muslim of Nigerian descent.
He'd just been released from the Metropolitan Detention Center where he was awaiting trial on federal terrorism charges.
We did.
He was being defended pro bono by a non-profit in Brooklyn.
I'm afraid one of our former officers works at this non-profit and was very involved in the case.
We have no reason to believe she had any foreknowledge of the bombing, but we're looking into it.
Ma'am, the fact is the blast happened less than 20 blocks from your hotel.
You're not saying he was heading toward me.
We just don't know.
Thank God he never reached his destination.
You sure?
A TV.
You're leaving now?
And thanks for this.
It's okay.
Nothing better happen to this child.
There's a bathroom.
Lock yourself in until I say it's okay to come out.
Yes.
Whoever it is knew that I would use the audio file to get my client released.
Just wait.
Are you aware of what's going on at your house?
Why, what is it?
It's on TV.
They're calling it a hostage situation.
Ma'am, I need you to keep moving.
That's my house.
Chief, she says she lives here.
What's going on?
The shooter's got two hostages-- a young girl and a Hispanic woman.
Look, I-I-I don't know what you think is going on or why, but you need to understand something.
The man in there is a US soldier just released from psychiatric care, suffering from severe PTSD, and this is making things worse.
Let me go in and talk to him.
- You need to calm down!
The shooter's position is confirmed.
Let's do it.
Do what?
Ma'am, you have to come with me.
Back off!
- You don't want to do this!
Welcome back.
To reality.
So, how is your sister?
I've been?
How did we get on to this anyway?
The evidence Iran is cheating on the nuclear deal?
Why, is there a problem?
Well, you tell me.
I go to Abu Dhabi where they have me question this Iranian financier they found, Nafisi.
You said he was lying.
Well, he may not be the only one.
Because afterward, I'm shredding documents and I see it-- a gold pack of Nafisi's cigarettes in a place it couldn't possibly be-- a room we used only for surveillance, a room Nafisi never set foot in.
The obvious.
Mossad must have been briefing him in that room before I arrived-- what to say, how to act, you know.
You think the whole thing was a charade?
It's a real possibility.
Javadi.
I met up with him in the West Bank.
That's what the trip to my sister was all about.
Army?
I did, too.
Good for you.
What happened to you?
You obviously got hurt.
People can be very sympathetic.
I want to leave.
It's the best way to show you don't want to hurt anyone.
Franny, go back in there.
Get her back in there.
Franny, get back-- Franny, now!
You know what that is?
So we can agree we don't want to start a shooting war.
We can agree whatever.
What matters now is that guy in there.
Fine.
It's me.
Because that's what I asked you to do when I left here this morning.
That's what I've told everybody here.
I shouldn't have left you alone here with her.
And I'm so sorry.
So it's-- it's my fault, okay?
But that doesn't mean I know how to get us out of this.
So I'm gonna come in now, okay?
Just me.
They're not.
With Latisha?
They're safe.
And the policeman?
He's not a policeman.
Quinn, tell me he's okay.
What have we got?
Do we have audio?
I never should have let you come in here.
Shut up!
Keep your heads down.
- Get back in the bathroom.
- Quinn, put it down.
Back off!
They've been watching us.
This whole thing-- it's a misunderstanding.
No, it's not.
I have proof.
Mommy.
Don't move.
He's my Chief of Staff.
Buying all of their promises of deals and treaties and global cooperation, and she invites them in to our cities.
Hey, beautiful girl.
I promise.
Sweetie?
She's had a long day.
It shouldn't be more than an hour.
Bring Hop.
I will.
He needs me.
I know he does.
General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.
Where did you run to?
And what I'm wondering-- would you fight for her, General?
I fight for my country.
Well, I am with you there.

I did not think it possible for a machine to be on edge.
Has one of your playthings rebelled?
Agent may has begun to question the narrative she was programmed with.
It is no more than a slight complication.
Then I will un-complicate it for you.
what have you done to me?
Why can I not kill her?
My primary directive requires me to protect these people.
Then we are both powerless.
Not entirely.
If they become a direct threat to the framework, then they no longer require protection.
And there are already two agents that fall into this category --
Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson.
The inhuman.
She's hacked into the framework.
The two are inside with memories intact, trying to dismantle it.

Last time I checked, you weren't really rooting for team inhuman.
When an enemy sacrifices his life for yours, you have to question if you're fighting for the wrong side.
Seeing that building collapse on the patriot, I -- wait, the patriot's dead?
It means...
Just -- just keep moving.
There is, however, cause for concern regarding her spine.
Will she walk?
The trauma shattered her t4 and t5 vertebrae.

But for now, your focus should be on the traitors who did this.

The guy on the TV said she was dangerous.
She seemed nice.
Sweetheart, the news is controlled by hydra.
Just try not to pay any attention to that, okay?
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'm gathering a team to search for Skye.
Call me crazy, but I think she can take care of herself.
I said no because I was afraid -- the way you're afraid right now.
Don't let emotion cloud your judgment.
That's not what's going on here.
Well, when I got that offer, i took it.
That's when someone came to me.
A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
What was his name?
She was the first person to tell me I could be a good man.
I can't just sit around and do nothing.
Try not to get killed, okay?
You see that look?
Maybe she's just racist.
Or starstruck.
It must've been difficult to recover these.
Howling commandos, right?
I always meant to ask you about that.
You're quite popular within the resistance.
You know it.
This is quantum-energy manipulation.
It was designed to build elements from thin air.
This -- this looks like it's creating something even more complex.
That machine required an immense amount of energy.
It was powered by a hydroelectric dam.
No doubt, this device would need a more substantial energy source.
Did you hear anything like that mentioned when you were undercover?
Nothing about a dam, but I heard someone talking about shipping parts east to some oil-drilling platform.
I think I know where the machine is being built.
Can we take the quinjet on a recon mission?
Are you sure the patriot's dead?
I saw the building collapse on him.
I have the body-cam footage to prove it.
This is our window.
Not careful enough.
Come on!
Where's ward?
He went looking for Skye.
Mace was always the one to make these calls.
Let's go check it out.
Maybe you can show the other kids how to fix a radio.
That might take a while, but okay.
They'll be following s.O.P. For a hostile inhuman.
Like what they did with the patriot?
What I did.
that air strike was on my order.
You can't blame yourself for their lies.
Once you learned the truth, you fought back.
That is what we need.
If more people see what you saw, maybe they'll fight back, too.
how is she?
No change.
bakshi's exposι worked.
You've found them?
I have men closing in on their location now.
I want to monitor this situation personally.
Finish the machine.
O-of course.
anything for you.
Torrent downloaded from RARBG father?
Focus on what she needs, son.
I'll put these traitors down -- for good.
I'm here to help you not the woman who held my daughter hostage.
we have to go -- now.
this place was originally built during prohibition.
We have a secret tunnel out of here.
Lead the way.
Looks like a drilling platform, like all of them.
maybe here.
I was so certain.
I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing.
No, this is where she's building it, just not in this world.
And now I know what it will do.
She wants to make herself into a real person.
A real girl, as opposed to...?
Every step has been towards that goal -- the -- the framework, Radcliffe, Fitz...
We have to stop her.
But whatever we do, we need to do it fast.
About a week ago.
We believe they got out underground.
We lost seven agents.
I don't care if you have to send 100 agents to their deaths.
they broke her spine.
I want them dead!
Don't you snap at me, boy.
So, what now?
I have yet to turn over every stone.
Someone knows where they're going.
I'll find them.
you were right.
welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D..
Probably should've guessed that.
Been looking for this place for years.
Thank god you're all right.
Could really help the cause.
I'm gonna go talk to Simmons -- she and, uh, agent triplett are on a -- a recon mission.
She told me about the other world.
And I need you to trust me.
I know a way for us to get back home.
By "us," you don't mean me.
I'm glad you're safe, Daisy.
where are the traitors going?
Why would agent may betray hydra for Skye?
So that's who I heard through the vent.
What are they planning?
Clearly, i wasn't in on any plan, or I wouldn't still be in this bloody cell.
You come from that other world, just like them.
You're just as tainted.
You want to talk about that "other world," as you call it?
It's the real world.
He's a pathetic drunk.
Even here, you're nothing without him.
You'll be a disappointment to your son yet again.
You know nothing -- about me or my son.
I don't know what you mean.
It's -- it's... coulson, this is the only chance to actually wake people up.
Getting to Radcliffe's coordinates right now is next to impossible.
That'sverykindofyou, Mr.bakshi, butI couldn'tpossibly impose- -
I know just the place.
heard you were looking for some enemies of the state.
Stay quiet and we won't have a problem.
If you think you can force me, sunil bakshi, to go on air and slander hydra, then you're delusional.
I am the most trusted voice in journalism -- just, uh, put it in the teleprompter, then.
We don't need you to say a damn thing.
The facts will speak for themselves.
It's done, Ophelia.
I've completed the design.
You won't have to live like this for much longer.
I had my doubts about the project, but I finally see it.
Your new body will be stronger.
That's who you were meant to be.
I just have one request.
Take me with you.
I hoped you'd say that.
You might be on to something.
Or it's just a coping mechanism.
Not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous.
I've never done anything like this.
there's no sign that hydra's aware of us yet.
That'll change as soon as we start broadcasting.
I'm trying to lock the system, make it impossible for hydra to cut the feed, but it's not working.
We're just gonna have to flip the switch and hope for the best.
I'll keep the signal going, hold the fort as long as I can.
I would hate for you to think that I am anything like the Grant ward you knew over there.
Simmons said he was a real son of a bitch.
Guessing things didn't end well.
No need to explain.
There's one thing i need to know.
Honestly, i don't know.
although she is hydra, so...
And I hope that Skye comes back to you.
What happened?
Oh, just a little chat with Dr. Radcliffe.
Did he talk?
Not yet.
I told you that I'd no longer tolerate failure.
No, but he did slip up.
He mentioned he heard something through the air vent, so... proof they were conspiring.
We just have to get the truth out of him.
Only problem is, the man's prepared to die.
Well, then we give him a reason to live.
the patriot would've been proud of what we did today.

Not the same.
Once we get a lock-on, my men have orders to shoot it down.
May God make me truly worthy.
He is my husband.
Don't get any ideas.
Fertility is a gift directly from God.
You girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful and their barren wives.
You will bear children for them.
Welcome to the friggin' loony bin.
Blessed are the meek, dear.
He's the Commander's driver.
Maybe he watches me.
There's an Eye in your house.
Be careful.
My name is June.
I intend to survive.
Blue.
I let it take me.
Blue Moon.
Rhapsody in Blue.
Tangled Up in Blue.
Blue Oyster Cult.
We bought it off Craigslist.
It smelled like maple syrup.
Luke said it was a leak in the radiator, it was probably bad for kids.
After we got it fixed, I missed that smell.
And so did Hannah.
Would you like to take the long way?
Okay, whatever.
We're going home.
Are you from here?
Brookline.
I moved here for school.
Once we did nine volumes on the history of falconry.
Yeah, it kind of sounds amazing.
That was my dad's parish.
My daughter was baptized there.
They took down St. Patrick's in New York City.
Blew it up and dumped every stone in the Hudson River.
It was someone.
I know.
There's a way to help them.
You can join us.
What do you mean "us"?
There's a network.
No one is until they have to be.
You should find out and tell us.
There is an "us"?
It seems imagined, like secrets in the fifth grade.
People with mysterious histories and dark linkages.
It doesn't seem as if it should be the true shape of the world.
That's a hangover from an extinct reality.
Now, the Guardians of the Faithful and American soldiers still fight with tanks in the remains of Chicago.
Now, Anchorage is the capital of what's left of the United States, and the flag that flies over that city has only two stars.
Now, darkness and secrets are everywhere.
You were gone a while.
Sometimes we walk home along by the river.
You need to be careful.
By the river?
He wants to see you.
Who?
The Commander.
Tonight, in his office.
Why?
It's forbidden for us to be alone with the Commanders.
Maybe he knows about Ofglen.
Have I been invited to my own ending?
'Cause it isn't an invitation.
I've got it.
Thank you.
Who is it?
What will she give birth to?
An Unbaby, with a pinhead or a snout like a dog's or no heart?
The chances for a healthy birth are one in five, if you can get pregnant at all.
You all right?
Breathe, breathe.
There's a smell coming from that room.
Something primal.
It's the smell of genesis.
Exhale, exhale, exhale.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
And hold, hold, hold.
Is Daddy keeping you awake?
Very good, I think.
Hey, will the doctor call me when the tests come back?
The lab just sent them up.
All normal.
Where are the babies?
We had a difficult night.
It's so crowded up there.
At least someone spiked the juice.
You okay?
He wants to see me, alone.
Your commander?
Let me see what I can find out.
It's too dangerous.
What are you doing?
Come with me.
Offred, what's going on up there?
Her contractions are getting much closer together.
It's taking forever.
Well, we'll have to be patient then, won't we?
Yes, ma'am.
Would you like a cookie, dear?
Offred, would you like a cookie?
Here you are.
Isn't she well behaved?
You can go.
Little whores, all of them.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Hold, hold, hold.
Get her to the chair.
Tell her it's time.
It's time.
It's time to push.
Push, push, push!
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
A fine and healthy girl.
God be praised.
Clumsy!
This is a time for rejoicing, my love.
This is our happy, happy moment.
Think of what's to come for you, my girl.
She's just perfect.
I got some snacks.
Where is she?
What?
What are you doing?
She's alive.
My baby.
I told them.
She's not your baby.
Of course she is.
Isn't she beautiful?
Don't take my baby!
But that doesn't mean it's bad.
Especially a carpetmunching gender traitor.
Time to get up now.
This little girl needs a nip.
Yeah, I nursed my son.
I've done it before.
Caleb used to do that when he ate.
Pull my hair like that.
Caleb's your brother.
I'm your mommy.
Beyond the Commander's door is a place where women do not go.
Not even Serena Joy.
What male totems are kept in there?
I guess there may be something he wants from me.
To want is to have a weakness.
That gives me hope.
"Justin, are you down there?"
And then she descends, with a stupid smile, to her bloody end.
That girl is a fucking moron.
Close the door behind you.
Sit down.
Please.
You can look at me.
We're not supposed to.
Hello there.
Hi.
I imagine you must find this strange.
I guess it's a little strange.
Do you know how to play?
Yes.
Threeeightysix to threeeightythree.
You're good, but I caught you at the end there.
I'm rusty.
Then we'll have to have a rematch.
All right.
I'm out of town next week, but when I get back?
I'll check my schedule.
Where are you going?
Nothing exciting, just meetings.
Well, after you get back, then.
It's a date.
Now, I think it's time for you to go home.
Thank you for the game.
You're very welcome.
Good night.
Good night.
Does he know what the Commander and I did last night?
Our illicit journey into the world of triple word scores?
Does he care?
I think he does.
Will she be surprised by the Scrabble game?
She'll be proud of me for that.
Blessed be the fruit.
May the Lord open.
Praised be.
Has Ofglen been transferred to a new post so soon?
I am Ofglen.
Fuck.
Seriously, you idiots haven't figured this out by now?
It all started when we blew up the time pigs, the Time Masters, now history's all screwed up, and it's up to us to unscrew it up.
Half the time, we screw things up even worse.
Who writes this crap anyway?
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...
Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?
Yes, it was the spear that was purportedly used to penetrate the side of Christ after he died on the cross.
And now, it can be used to rewrite reality itself.
Then what would the Speedster need the Spear of Destiny for?
He could just go back and change history himself.
Changes to history cause timequakes and aberrations, which we can undo.
Changes to reality, however, those are permanent.
You created an interface between a mystical relic from the first century and a 22nd-century supercomputer.
A deep scan reveals that Captain Hunter's neural architecture has been reprogrammed with a new identity.
Including the locations of the other pieces of the spear, I hope.
We would hardly be doing Captain Hunter any favors if we just restored the memories without taking the liberty to address some of his shortcomings.
Can I help you with something, soldier?
No, General Washington, I'm fine.
You, on the other hand...
Stand at ease.
But that doesn't mean we have to fight fair, now does it?
These Americans... they call themselves patriots, but they will die as traitors.
Grab yourselves a rifle, lads.
After all, it's Christmas.
In that case, kill them all, collect their fragment of the Spear of Destiny, and bring it to me.
Whoever knew time travel would be so much fun? How long till Lily's interface tracks down another piece of the Spear of Destiny?
Rip's probably being tortured by the Legion of Doom right now.
The sooner we can locate another piece of the spear, the sooner we can set a trap and rescue him.
I could always reroute power to my sub-neural processing unit by shutting off life support.
I wasn't joking.
And you're telling me this because?
What would you have me do then, use a knife and fork?
You know, I thought I was gonna hate Ray's chore wheel, but breakfast duty's kind of fun.
And it tastes way better than a food fabricator.
See, that's the problem with the Temporal Zone.
I just love being outside, under the stars.
That sounds terrible and cold and miserable.
I'm a city guy, and that does not work for me whatsoever.
What, is there something on my face?
A little.
Um, what was that?
Did you guys feel that timequake?
General Washington was murdered that Christmas.
Washington's a punk.
He led America to independence and became its first President.
If Washington's so cool, why his he on the $1 bill and Franklin's on the $100 bill?
- Like I said, trap.
Well, surely you're not suggesting we do nothing.
Wait, how do we even know where to find Washington?
Keith would've thrown a Christmas banquet for Washington and his men.
Secret mission on Christmas Eve.
Congratulations, Mick, you just became a private in the U.S. Army.
Nate, Amaya, you two will pose as wealthy newlyweds eager to make a contribution to the revolutionary cause.
Ray, I need you to miniaturize down in the ATOM suit...
A toy in a Christmas stocking.
And run reconnaissance.
All right, let's go save America.
You're from Boston.
Tell me, are you familiar with the Sons of Liberty?
Well, they, um, they certainly do things differently up in Boston.
It's got a kick.
It's my wife Martha's recipe.
At your service.
Now tell me, from which of our 13 fair colonies do you hail from?
The first one.
Get him out of there, Sara.
General Washington, we have to go.
I don't have time to explain, but your life is in danger.
You are a most unusual woman.
Dip.
Me-rry Christmas!
Rip?
Mr. Rory, we meet again.
What the hell is wrong with you?
On the contrary, nothing has ever been more right.
If anything, we're a bit more alike now, aren't we?
We need Gideon's medical capabilities to extract the bullet and repair any internal damage.
What's happening?
Whatever fried the ship must've done the same thing to our Quantum Splicer, like an EMP.
Jax... it was Rip.
Well, apparently, they have, but our mission remains clear.
Whatever the Legion's done to Rip, we gotta get him back.
Jax, I'm putting you in charge.
I'll try to stabilize her, but we need Gideon.
I don't know how to be a Captain, man.
Yes, you do, Jefferson.
Sara's still hanging on, and Grey's taking care of her.
And she's put me in charge.
Me and mini Ray will work on restoring the ship's power.
You and Amaya need to rescue Washington so he can cross the Delaware.
- That was implied.
Listen, Rip's out there too, but his brain's been scrambled by the Legion, so we need to bring him back.
I mean, if he's been brainwashed, then...
I'm gonna find that skinny little Englishman and strangle him to death.
You take the front, I take the rear.
If we face them now, they will surely kill us, Private.
They're gonna kill us anyway.
There are rules to war.
Yeah, kill or be killed.
British high command will treat us honorably, just as I treat prisoners, with honor.
Now I know why Franklin's on the $100 bill.
I hate Christmas.
Wait, so Rip became Phil, and now he's Rip again, but evil?
Right, when I was a kid, I would run out of the room any time the flying monkeys come on.
I saw that with Bobby Padusky.
Wait a minute, so there was life before Rex?
He got freaked out by the flying monkeys too?
Hitler ruins everything.
How's Sara?
Guys, what was that?
And thanks to his EMP, every weapon on this ship has been rendered useless.
Damn it, Jefferson, I'm a physicist, not a doctor.
And I'm a mechanic, not a Captain.
So I guess we're both trying out new things today.
Sure, but, you know, you gotta work up to it.
Nowadays, relationships are just... chill.
We're being watched.
You sure you heard someone?
I mean, I hear the sound of rushing water, but I don't think anyone else is out here.
Seals are cute.
No, Nathaniel, stay awake.
This isn't how I pictured getting you naked.
You pictured getting me naked?
For England!
Come on, you bastards, heave!
And this is why I avoided medical school.
You have to do this.
Whoa, the ship looks a lot different when you're the size of an action figure.
It's good to be home.
Very clever.
Now, which one of my former teammates could possibly be fighting back?
Give it up, Jax!
I taught you everything you know about the Waverider.
There's nowhere to hide, Jax.
I know every nook and cranny on this ship.
General Washington, as I live and breathe.
I have a new colonel who's most impressive.
One might say he's ahead of his time.
If you two are done yapping, I'd like my last meal.
Take these men to my tent, and have them well fed.
You'll both be hung in the morning.
I am an officer in the Continental Army, sir.
And you will be hanged for treason against King George III.
He will be returned to his regiment tomorrow with news of your death.
That's embarrassing.
Just so you know, that water was very cold, so if you happened to have sneaked a peek, it's not a fair representation of...
Nate, I wasn't looking down there.
Because that would be unprofessional.
It's warm by the fire.
It's warmer in the tent.
I suppose, after all we've been through, a kiss would seem quaint.
It would seem old-fashioned.
Mr. Jackson!
Man, this guy's really starting to piss me off.
You can't run forever, Mr. Jackson.
Something tells me I'm getting warmer.
Nope, colder.
Man, the Legion really must've fried your brain.
I bet you couldn't even find your own ass with both hands and a flashlight.
I don't want to hurt you, Jax.
Yeah, says the guy who shot Sara.
A small price to pay for the Spear of Destiny, don't you think?
It's a job that the Legion will reward me handsomely for, as they would you.
What, not even your father's life?
The spear allows us to rewrite reality.
Your mother would no longer be a widow, and you...
When they change shifts, I'm gonna bust us out of here.
Are you really so anxious to die?
I argued for your life, Mr. Rory.
That's why I'm taking you with me.
I'd rather die a gentleman than return to Mount Vernon a scoundrel.
I trust that I may depend on you to deliver this to my wife, Martha?
Consider it a last request.
Or are you too much of a pansy?
We must prove to the world that you don't need a title to be a gentleman.
The British may be dishonorable, but I am not.
By my death, I will prove to the Crown what it means to be an American.
You don't know the first thing about being an American.
We're misfits, outcasts, and we're proud of it.
And if they're gonna hang you, you fight dirty and you never, ever give up.
How long were we asleep?
We have to go.
I'm up, just need to get dressed, unless you think we have time for, you know...
We have a job to do.
Okay, please don't let this kill me.
The man who recruited a bunch of reject super heroes to not save his family?
Don't tell me you miss that self-righteous idiot.
Captain Rip Hunter was the puppet!
My new allies, they freed me.
Looks like this will be your last Christmas.
Wait, I know where the piece of the spear is.
Smart play.
Show me.
Rats.
No, because the old Rip was a fool for believing that time is worth saving, and you were even bigger fools for believing him.
Now, my patience is wearing thin.
Where's the spear fragment?
In the same place you left it.
I think I'll let you do the honors.
I underestimated you, Jax.
And I won't make that mistake again.
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt this tender moment.
- Get away from her.
- Not another step.
Now, one last time, where's the piece of the spear?
Don't make me ask you again.
I'm not telling you nothing.
Now just... just let her go.
You say her name as if she's supposed to matter to me.
She doesn't.
Honest to a fault, Jax.
Jefferson?
It's too late.
Raymond, if you can hear me, you must get the main power online.
Without Gideon, I can't save her.
This is why we have a chore wheel!
Whoa, that is a long way down, but you weren't captain of the varsity diving team for nothing.
Gideon, thank God.
Luckily, her brain cells are still functioning.
Let's see what I can do, shall we?
Any last words?
In fact, I've learned a new word from my Private.
Come on, Georgie boy.
If you're expecting me to blink, it's gonna be a long day.
A gentleman would stay and fight, but as an American, I suggest we run.
Don't move!
You haven't got it in you.
There's no rhyme nor reason to any of this, Jax.
History is war and slavery and holding your dead son in your arms.
There's no point in protecting history, so we might as well just burn it all down.
I will make it easier for you.
No?
Well, it's just as I thought.
It looks like Rip put together a pretty good team.
He's with the Legion now.
The Rip we know is gone.
You know what day it is, Jax?
It's Christmas.
It's when we remember to be our best selves.
Why are you protecting him?
Speaking of Christmas miracles, the British are coming.
To fighting like an American.
I always do.
It's not bad.
I don't understand much of what I've seen, but the world is changing.
And you are no small part of that.
The Hessians will be receiving a Christmas surprise this evening.
You sneaky bastard.
You're not such a gentleman after all.
Your rebel spirit, your steadfastness, your crass yet effective use of language, you, Mr. Rory, represent the best of what our new nation can be.
Yes, yes, I do.
Gideon, is the American Revolution back on track?
Yes, history has been restored.
Though there is now a statue in the nation's capital that bears a striking resemblance to Mr. Rory.
So, how you feeling, Captain?
Good, considering.
Well, it's good to have you back.
And I think I'm just about done being in charge for a while.
Well, would you care to do the honors?
If that's a mouse, then I'm good, homie.
Is this meaningless?
I don't know, maybe, maybe not.
I totally agree.
Me, I am the ambassador of chill.
All right, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and whatever people say who exist outside the timeline.
Now, I know that it may seem like we don't have anything to celebrate.
Rip's been brainwashed and took our piece of the Spear of Destiny.
There's a monument in Washington D.C. to Rory.
But... we saved America, and we're gonna save Rip and get back the rest of the spear, because as powerful as the Legion may be, they don't have this.
Do you think this really works?
Oh, it's just about making the candidate seem familiar, so that the voter sees herself in him.
But... you've gone too far.
There.
-Then I'm back for the event with Cathy.
Do you think it's worth it?
There's a rumor the committee's trying to make a deal with Garrett Walker.
No, Walker doesn't want to do damage to the party.
So why did Jim Matthews agree to appear?
I'm already getting pummeled with questions about it.
-Does he have anything to say?
-Uh, even if he pleads the Fifth, they get a perp walk that implicates the president.
I didn't know anyone actually ate those.
I look forward to this stuff all year.
Do we have anything on the committee members?
Nothing too juicy yet, I'm afraid.
Committee chairman's squeaky clean other than a minor back-tax issue.
I did find some revenge porn on the chairman's chief of staff, but I don't think it's worth much.
I gotta say, they look a lot better on you, Mrs. Underwood, than they would on Governor Conway.
Maybe that's why he didn't wanna pay for it.
These masks will be distributed to all MTA engineers, conductors and maintenance workers.
And this model is highly effective in case of a chemical attack.
And I believe Mayor Adalardi would like to say a few words.
Absolutely.
I thought for sure the president would have heard.
It's great to see you, Claire.
Governors, we are running out of time.
I do not accept it.
But we will not be deterred by Washington's failure to address it.
The question of what it is to be an American, the very essence of American-ness, how we choose to lead our lives, open and free, is on the line.
Fear is un-American.
And yes, the irony of saying those words to you on Halloween, of all days, is not lost on me.
But although we may choose, as Americans, to scare ourselves once a year for fun... no one else tells any American when to shake in their boots at any other time.
I'm commending Governor Sally Morrison of the great state of Arizona, for giving us all such a good example of voting centers as used in their recent primary.
But I need him.
I need all five on my side if I'm gonna win this election.
Matthews, in our history, he's the biggest known unknown.
But, you see, in politics, stature is everything.
And wouldn't you say that Willy C is getting shorter by the minute?
These border restrictions the president is proposing... should the military play a role in enforcing them, General?
In particular, the incident for which he was awarded the Purple Heart stands out.
Someday soon, America needs to hear the full story of that day.
Thank you for your time, General Brockhart.
In terms of allocation of funds, it's our water supply that keeps me up at night.
Roger, are you talking about protecting the infrastructure?
The big question here, are the feds doing all they can do?
Now, look, gentlemen, all I can see is that we're in violent agreement with each other.
You knew me when I had hair, Mr. President.
Will, have you seen this?
I checked with the local authorities in Salida, sir.
It doesn't look good.
Yes, sir.
I haven't slept a good night's sleep since 2012.
But I guess elected officials don't sleep so our constituents can.
The proof of success in fighting terror... is something the public never hears about.
A certain city in my state wears the biggest target in the nation.
The city and state of New York... has scored silent wins for 15 years... without a declaration of war.
-Well, by all means, continue, Governor.
And I'd like to thank the president for the opportunity to discuss this very important topic, and apologize for, uh, being on such a tight schedule.
Well, we are enormously grateful that the governor took the time to come and join us today.
I'm just trying to understand.
And that's what worries me.
I'm just operating on instinct, Ken.
But then you made reference to something about two very close friends that's nobody's business, including yours.
I'm sure I don't know anything you don't.
I'm just very interested in your perspective.
Frank worshipped Tim, would have done anything for him.
I don't know.
If the world were a different place back then... who knows?
And lucky him.
He should have called you back.
Francis and Tim were very good friends.
But, you know, Ken, the older I get, I learn that assumptions are dangerous.
It was great to see you.
The vice president will be filling in for her.
Oh, my...
So, uh, where's the First Lady?
I smell a swing state party.
Tone, Rick.
You didn't have to round up dozens of governors just to talk to the five of us.
You're here because there have been concerning threats in exurban counties in each of your states.
Could you be more specific?
Which is why it's crucial that we work with your states' administrations leading up to the election.
Every one of those precincts is a typically Republican stronghold.
Now, we believe this course of action, the voting centers with the added law enforcement, will give us everything that we need to protect the integrity of the ballot box.
Okay, but speaking for Governor Olmstead and maybe all of our bosses, how can we be sure that these measures won't discourage everyone from getting to the polls?
- I.e., Democrats.
- It's a chance we have to take.
Preventing further acts of terrorism is just about all that matters, Tanya.
Putting aside the very real moral questions, how is shutting down the borders even feasible?
I know this policy is going to hurt some people, but let me explain why it's necessary.
And the vice president should feel free to jump in.
-That's not what I do.
It's more like the opposite.
I just try and articulate... what's on their minds and in their hearts.
That's how you see your job?
Basically, my job is to remain invisible.
I'm not gonna answer that.
You make yourself sound replaceable.
I am.
-I serve at the pleasure of the president.
-And the First Lady?
But you write speeches for both of them?
Most often for Mrs. Underwood.
Has she put you in charge of any other parts?
Good luck with the alimony.
It's not sustainable.
I mean, what do you think?
-About what?
-About the president's rush to war.
At least half the Beltway seems to think it's outrageous.
It is outrageous.
Let's... take a step back for a moment.
But now, I understand the terrible box you were in, the forces--
I honestly don't know what you're talking about.
Are you telling me your plan is just to phone it in until January 20th?
Back in the day, you and Marjorie were at the forefront of every progressive cause, literally fighting the good fight.
These people... can we really let them do this?
I offered you an out.
You should've taken that opportunity to resign, then and there.
And, just so you know, right before her mind was truly gone, Marjorie called it.
So this meeting between our bosses today...
The president is looking forward to a productive discussion with Governor Matthews.
You want us to engage in voter suppression.
I'm listening.
I have two words for you. "Slag heap."
Matthews wants the EPA to name a slag heap on the outskirts of Philadelphia as a Superfund site.
I seriously doubt that can happen before the election.
I think you should battle your doubts, Doug.
The governor is willing to let the past stay in the past.
But unless the Underwood administration is bearing top-tier gifts, you've got a lot of fucking nerve asking for favors from the former VP.
Don't you always feel sorry for the horse?
Who's in the conference room?
-You mean the lady brigade?
Welcome to the NSA.
Hey, boss.
I won't take up much of your time.
I know you have a busy afternoon.
-Well, I've got a little time.
Because I asked them to.
We're members of a tiny brotherhood, you and I, of ex-VPs.
But I'm willing to say fuck my gut.
Bottom line is I can help you with this committee or I can hurt you.
Now, I can say that I know nothing... and that what I saw in Garrett Walker was a troubled man.
And I can leave it at that.
What do you think?
Oh, I can't tell you what to do, Jim.
Governor Scanlon.
Mr. President.
You've been on my mind.
I wanna talk to your boss about the Declaration of War Committee.
So... if you're hoping to intimidate him because of the back taxes, you can save your breath.
His closet is back to being clean.
What about yours?
I'm just the messenger.
There are ways to get rid of it.
Look, I'm guessing, sooner or later, I get called.
And if that happens, I could plead the Fifth.
I could press-secretary them all day long.
But I'd like to have another option on the table.
But, just to be clear, you're telling me you have evidence the president engaged in criminal activity?
Not evidence regarding the president, no.
I have a lot of information about his chief of staff.
Doug Stamper.
Mr. Grayson?
-How long have you been with the paper?
Oh, that would explain why I don't know you.
It says you're a dedicated civil servant with the bank account to prove it.
Anyway, recognized you, just wanted to say hi.
I mean, unless we can buy you a drink.
Next to him is, uh, Kim Feldshuk, works at the DoD.
We're going old school this afternoon.
Come on, join us for a quick one.
"Mouthpiece"?
I don't know why he was talking to the press in the first place.
But what I want to know is, what do you see?
Why don't you like Yates?
Uh, Tom is an important part of the team.
I... just wouldn't want anyone to infer a personal investment on his part that isn't useful to the campaign.
I appreciate that, LeAnn.
Meaning what?
Well, the center covers most of the US government cyber traffic.
-What if it takes you longer?
-Uh, it won't, because another ten, 20 minutes and...
Do it.
I just saw the Haines article.
I have no idea what Tom was thinking.
Yes.
It was sloppy.
Are you all right?
How was New York?
My events went well.
I bumped into Ken Caswell.
-Why didn't you call him back?
Well, I didn't realize it was gonna become so personal.
Not even for presidents.
What did he say to you?
Ken's got a big mouth.
I know how you felt about him.
You know you're the only person I've ever truly loved.
You know that, right?
Welcome back.
You mad at me?
You shouldn't have said that.
I know.
I know we need to be careful.
But don't you get tired of being far bigger than careful all the time?
I lost connection on my server.
What am I to you, anyway?
Or you, to me?
I mean, are you my girlfriend?
And when you win... does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?
First Concubine?
I hate apologies.
I'm sorry.
-When?
-Why would you ask that?
- God damn it.
- What's wrong?
The GPS thinks we're back at the White House.
I can't miss this flight.
- It's ringing.
Hello?
Hello!
-Can you get through to the office?
Garrett is a good man.
And is he the kind of man who would knowingly participate in campaign finance fraud?
I've known the president four years.
Isn't it a fact that it was Francis Underwood and not President Walker who first suggested you should resign?
To the best of my recollection, no.
And isn't it true that the source of campaign funds you received as the president's running mate was connected to a pay-for-play scheme that reached all the way from Missouri to China?
To the best of my knowledge, no.
Did you receive any campaign donations through Raymond Tusk's firm, Clayton West?
Not to the best of my recollection.
Do you think your recollection or knowledge will improve as the day goes on?
Excuse me?
You were the love of Tim's life, you know that.
Well, I should probably...
Goodbye.
Thank you, Felix.
Uh, would you like me to prepare it for you, sir?
Never allow yourself to be overcome with smoke.
Now, I like a one-inch base of ash.
It's helpful, but of course they clean up around here too soon to do that.
Now, as for the architecture of the logs, I prefer the upside-down method.
Largest logs right along the base.
Then medium-size logs after that.
Small logs.
And then finally, kindling... and tinder.
But then, if a man cannot use what's right in...
God damn it, Tim.
Uh, I gotta take this.
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Just wanted to let you know.
Thanks for the drinks.
Come on.
And, finally, you strike your match... you ignite your kindling... and then you blow.
It's happening, sir.
Expect traffic and travel delays as authorities are still trying to determine the scope of the problem.
-Are we gonna make this flight?
- My God.
Not yet.
They're patching through the heads of all the carriers, sir.
Gentlemen and ladies, can you hear me?
We're reaching out to as many people as we--
Did we just lose them?
Is this a joke?
The Ohio governor is calling from a payphone.
My fellow Americans, the facts are these.
In addition to intermittent outages, a considerable amount of havoc has been wreaked.
The system that maintains our sewers has been tampered with.
The perpetrators were targeting the government and their ultimate purpose, though foiled, was to disrupt all mid-Atlantic transportation networks.
Events like these underscore the urgency of my request to Congress for a declaration of war.
Tonight, I can only suspect Congress will spend a dark night of the soul, after which they will reconsider their paralysis and choose to act.
Capital East Telecom has informed me that it's repairing the network as fast as possible, but that it will take at least a couple more days to be fully restored.
It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact that we will continue to experience attacks until ICO and other terrorist groups like it are eliminated swiftly and completely.
Thank you.
We off?
I saw your interview.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't bring up the details of my combat record.
Governor, aren't you worried about bringing your kids out in the middle of a terrorist attack?
You've got to be kidding me.
What's on your mind, Governor?
What's on my mind?
I mean, you see what's going on here.
This is all him.
It's a man who's never served.
Wouldn't know what a real war was if it jumped up and bit him in the ass.
I mean, a declaration of war?
He's putting American lives in danger.
-War is real!
-Nightcap?
-You don't screw around with it.
All hell breaks loose.
I don't understand why the numbers are so low.
Shut up or you're fired.
No, not really.
Even went for a run, but...
You hungry?
Um, I just wanted to connect before the rest of this day kicks in.
Very good.
Today's gonna be a good day.
You can sleep when you get to the White House.
Or maybe not.
Are you ready... to catch me?
Doug, LeAnn... do you have a moment?
Reporting live from the Piedmont Hotel, the excitement is definitely...
Better not let them see the name on your credentials.
Those folks out there love their president.
How are you doing, Seth?
Which means eventually someone gets to ask me if my articles affected the President's loss.
Or his win.
We're going to have a great night tonight.
You don't have to spin me.
How shall I say this?
When I was single, I always picked the loser's party.
I met the last Mrs. Hammerschmidt drowning in tequila shots at the Bob Dole ballroom.
And here I am... single again.
- You're not in Texas anymore.
I like to win.
Hello, everyone.
Well, it's still early.
But once we do get there, we are going to shake the hand of each and every one of you, to thank you for all the extraordinary work that you've done for us.
That's right, a round of applause all the way around.
And we'll see you all at the party a little later.
Better?
Yeah, a little.
I got to put on a suit.
- People will be here soon.
- Will... can't you let yourself feel it?
I understand you've been briefed.
I understand.
I'm with the Vice President, the Secretary of State Durant, and on the line with us is Counterterrorism Director Green.
Governor, sir, I'm sorry, but we needed to act.
I contacted local law enforcement directly.
We do not want to do anything that affects today's voting.
The suspect was not in his apartment, but we did find bomb-making material.
- Jesus, uh...
- Now, Mitch... the last thing we want is for you to panic.
You must know that you have the full support of the federal government here.
Um, it... well, what... what's next?
We believe his target is one of the voting centers.
We know you have soldiers in place, security measures and checkpoints.
Director Green is on his way to you.
There will be a command center out of the FBI office in Knoxville where we will coordinate.
My family voted at the Coliseum this morning.
How are the Ohio numbers?
It's hard to gauge with turnout this low.
I would think that the president might have access to some numbers that we don't.
When I get them, you'll get them.
Yes, and let's see just how long this day lasts.
Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me about Muhammed Kalabi just... moments before you did.
Situation is still unfolding.
On Election Day?
Francis... it's been quite a journey working with you.
Kalabi slipped into the country, and he's planning a terrorist attack... against a voting center in Tennessee.
And that is a terrifying proposition.
Well, I may need you to stay around the White House a bit longer, Cathy, until this situation is resolved.
Of course.
I was only saying... it's been a good run.
As if she could ever get under my skin.
Patti, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
Miss Harvey was just telling me that there's been a change in the schedule.
- Yes, we met at the convention.
Four years is no time.
We have a car waiting.
So we're shaking hands today?
I think it's best we keep it like that.
Well, shake it like you mean it.
How's that?
So you want me to just head over to the ballroom?
Victory.
This is for when you win.
I wrote a concession speech as well.
With increased security at polling places across the country, will fewer Americans vote for the president this year than in any election in recent memory?
You know, if turnout is low in Philadelphia... the Underwoods are going under.
You need a better in than that.
You look like you've been chewed up and shit out twice today.
Seems like you're having trouble focusing.
You ever see a doctor about that?
Um, what?
Oh, 'cause I feel pretty comfortable diagnosing you with too much on your fucking mind.
Two Oban.
Celebrating what?
Oh, you know Tom Hammerschmidt's long lead team?
Don't you think it's a little late for quid pro quo?
Oh, the Underwoods could still win.
We'll see.
Either way, you still have a couple more months.
Your phone.
Can somebody give me a second today, you know?
... It's a very chaotic scene at the moment.
What?
... There's a lot happening right now.
Where the hell were you?
Muhammed Kalabi, the ICO guy from Syria who burned the effigy.
What's the plan?
Despite the violent incident at the voting center in Knoxville, which the President is attending to as we speak, we want to assure anyone who's considering not voting that it is not only safe to vote, it is your duty to do so.
Violence cannot beget apathy.
We must make our voices heard.
Seth!
Witnesses report an FBI and Homeland presence at the Knoxville voting center.
No?
Good.
Thank you.
I'm told everything just went wrong.
Oh, I don't know about that, Shawna.
Twelve people were taken to the hospital.
What the hell is this?
Well, I wish I were calling under better circumstances.
I wanted to know what you're going to need.
I can get some excellent people down there fast in case you... you're feeling like you need the extra security or...
You there?
You called my secretary of state?
Do I need to remind you, sir, that yours is a red state, and every Republican in it is counting on you?
She's like the rest of us, trying to figure this thing out.
Three o'clock wave said Tennessee's locked up, no matter what.
Love, no one can see.
What the hell?
They don't bark when there's a bomb.
The canine units don't bark when there's a bomb, Mr. President.
Yeah, but the whole building heard it.
They're trained to sit down when they detect a bomb.
- So did they sit down?
These dogs are our last line of defense, sir.
I think ICO got in there today.
And thank God they didn't get a bomb off, but whatever operative they got in there, I think... was used to provoke the riot.
... you are not closing the polls.
You think we should?
I can't weigh in on this.
I need to talk to Shawna.
This is a trend that dates back at least... to when Nixon avoided jail time.
Okay, we're out.
- You're good.
- I don't need fans, Sean.
Just genuine appreciation.
Would you like a drink?
One is brown and one is not.
Are you making the rounds?
Crowd's a little older than I'm used to, but... yes, they're a talkative bunch... that don't say much.
I'll take the brown one.
There's something wrong with Tennessee.
Your date is either lying or denying.
Nothing.
Forget it.
"There's still time"?
There's still time for what?
What are you doing?
You and your husband.
Getting ready to win an election.
I see the way you're acting.
Do you realize we have every intention of winning today?
Sure.
But then what?
I used to go to this cabin... up in Maine.
The windows don't close properly.
You can smell the ocean all summer long.
I do think it's better you go to the ballroom.
If you have not voted, I assure you, you will get the chance.
But I cannot, in good conscience, allow balloting to continue until I am satisfied that it is safe.
If you are not in your home by 8:30 p.m. central time, or by 9:30 in the eastern parts of this state, you will be subject to detention and possible arrest.
What the hell's going on?
What's going on is we're gonna win Pennsylvania and Ohio.
That's 272 without Tennessee.
That asshole's suspending the vote.
That's up to his secretary of state, and she's on our side.
I mean, how long do we let Francis Underwood get away with this kind of shit?
Trust me.
Bullshit.
Voting centers all across the state are being shut down, and anyone not in their homes by 8:30 central time, or 9:30...
Five o'clock wave from Philly.
That Tennessee shit is crazy.
Crazy shit happens all the time.
This convenient?
Spare me the conspiracy talk.
The government's not that powerful... or competent.
A man can ask.
We're looking at 255 Underwood, 245 Conway.
Pennsylvania and Ohio?
Still too close, but it's almost six o' clock.
When we change Tennessee from Conway to undecided...
Matthews?
What about the other five states in play?
Still not enough.
Olmstead's losing in Ohio, and he's not taking it well.
I spoke with his chief of staff, Tanya, this morning.
How much time do we have?
Why did you ask him to leave?
Because I just wanted to look in your eyes one more time before we do this.
Francis... we're doing this.
He can't save us.
He invented term limits.
Get me LeAnn Harvey back on the phone.
I'm on it.
LeAnn, get the lawyers ready.
Why are you here if LeAnn called me?
Do I really have to explain to you what will happen if you don't do this?
I don't care if he loses.
Where's LeAnn?
She's not here, and I'm short on time.
Governor, I'm sorry, but there's only one way to play this.
We need you to pull your poll workers and your machines from those three counties.
What are we talking about here?
Terrorist chatter.
Related to Tennessee?
Oh, I'm sorry, but the intelligence is classified, Governor.
The voting centers and the troops were the President's idea.
But you signed on to them, and that's what matters.
Now I'd say it's a good thing that the NSA just picked up on some credible chatter.
This dangerous world left you no choice.
Oh... thank you.
Governor, I was just handed the classified intel.
I'm sending the files over right now.
Voting centers in Ohio have been closed for almost two hours.
But even if they stay closed, would Ohio get us there?
Other states might be in play.
Rumblings of suppression are out there, although...
I also like an assemblyman we have in Georgia.
Well, that sounds like a bit of a stretch.
This is all uncharted territory.
All right, let's put a pin in Georgia and Maryland, and let's keep the Ohio voting centers shut down, and see where that gets us.
Pennsylvania has gone to Conway.
The President apologizes that he couldn't be here tonight, but he wanted me to let you know that concession is inevitable.
Jesus.
Well, I guess that's that.
Yeah, this is Will.
I wanted to be the first to tell you congratulations, Mr. President-elect.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
I guess that means the system is working.
I guess it does.
You're about as tough an opponent as they come, Francis.
Well, I've had a lot of practice.
Now, you be sure to give my regards to Hannah and the children.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I'm... sure I'll be calling on you for advice in the very near future.
Well, I look forward to that.
He conceded?
Excuse me, sir.
General Brockhart is on his way over to the suite.
Thank you.
Sources are telling us that Francis Underwood conceded to Governor Conway on the phone only a short time ago.
He says he can reopen and extend the voting day into tomorrow.
Underwood conceded already.
Do not trot out your secretary of state.
I feel like I'm risking my entire career here.
You are.
And if you don't do what I'm telling you, it's over for sure.
What?
What are you talking about?
Fuck me.
And in accordance with the Ohio secretary of state, the vote is suspended until further notice.
Now, I know this may put our electorates in question... but I had no choice.
Same with Illinois.
Looks like Nevada's making noises, too.
Are you seriously asking me about déjà vu?
Never mind.
Don't look so worried, Doug.
You just felt familiar for a second.
It's over.
Now, the presidency hangs in the balance.
At least six states will not have certified vote totals on Election Night 2016.
Good evening.
Will wishes he could be here himself... but we've been advised that goes against protocol.
I know... you're disappointed.
Are you okay with the word disappointed?
Shouldn't we acknowledge their outrage?
I'd say we should tread lightly.
Never a dull moment in this country.
Will wishes he could be here himself, but we've been advised that would go against protocol.
I know you're disappointed that the change you were hoping for that you voted for, has to wait a little longer.
And, finally, a night of electoral indecision, with lawsuits being filed in nearly every state, has ended with the mayor of Honolulu, in the last state to close its polls, refusing to honor the results of the election and filing a lawsuit.
Claire, could you do me a little favor?
No, actually the pain is right behind my eyes.
Could you just... rub my eyes for me?
But you hate that.
I know, but I think I'll like it this time.
You can do it harder.
Even harder than that.
There's no coming back from this.
Oh, I know exactly what we're about to do.
And what a relief that will be... for both of us.
The American people don't know what's best for them.
I do.
I know exactly what they need.
We have to hold their sticky fingers and wipe their filthy mouths.
They even need help writing their wildest dreams, crafting their worst fears.
Lucky for them... they have me... they have you.
2016.
2020.
2024.
2028.
2032.
2036.
Doug, LeAnn... do you have a moment?
Even if it only lasts for a couple of weeks.
And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God.
Do you have any comment?
God bless America.
People are sick and tired of all this confusion and chaos.
The public is not happy.
If you become president, would Claire Underwood remain as vice president?
Not if she wants what's best for the country.
But given the Twelfth Amendment, would you have a choice?
Uh, no further questions, everybody.
- I'm fine.
And Rasmussen changed his vote.
Well, he's been waiting a long time to pay me back.
Creating a deadlock in Rhode Island just gives him the spotlight.
He seems to be acting alone, but that could change.
Mr. President, it's possible we may need to consider the other option.
A rescheduled election.
No, no, I'll get Rasmussen back in line, and turn some others along the way.
We've arranged sit-downs for you and Madam President with all of the small states.
LeAnn and I can go door-to-door in Rayburn, Longworth and Cannon.
Three of my favorite buildings after this one.
What is it?
The McMurdo Research Facility in Antarctica.
You think the soldiers are Russian?
He thinks so.
They arrived via unmarked research vessels.
What I'm saying is this aggression in Antarctica, by powers unknown, is a direct result of the uncertainty that our presidential situation has wrought.
Congressman Watts, since when is Antarctica a concern for the Congressional Black Caucus?
I hope you're not implying that the caucus shouldn't have a voice in international affairs.
I've called a meeting tomorrow, for the Congressional Black Caucus, to discuss our positions, both foreign and domestic, before Monday's presidential vote.
Are you considering shifting your support to Conway?
Well, all I can say at this time, that the most important thing is unity... and the public's faith in the institution of democracy.
That's all for now.
You are in violation of the Antarctic Treaty System.
A treaty the USSR signed in 1959.
I'm simply stating I need to interpret agreements signed by the Soviet Union.
In which case, you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress.
The Cold War is over, Mrs. Acting President.
Well, then maybe we need to revisit the treaty.
Yes, you may think that we're distracted, but don't fool yourself.
American democracy is stronger than your sad attempt to take advantage of a bump in the road.
Oh, Francis, my eyes are on a landscape that is so much bigger than any one of your roads.
Well, Congressman Rasmussen, we're just surprised to see you come out on the wrong end of this, is all.
I mean, I suppose it must've been hard losing the House majority leadership all those years ago, but there is a difference between being bitter and being treasonous.
If it's new committee assignments you'd like, we can certainly arrange that.
It's over.
Did I mention I hate useless things?
- Think of the party, Congressman.
"Elder of the party" this, "bellwether senior member" that.
You have no idea, do you?
No one hears you walking the halls of this building... not anymore.
- Who are you working for?
Take all of the two hours you need to reconsider.
One more thing for your signature.
- You can leave this with me.
I'm on my way back to Rayburn.
You close the door, please?
I want to know.
If it was in all 50 states, not good.
But it's hard to argue with close to 30 years' experience.
The revote in Tennessee and Ohio is his best shot.
While it's what's best for Frank, it may not be what's best for you.
Thank you.
You seem like a reasonable man.
I know how to listen, if that's what you mean.
If the president regains his office...
"If" doesn't make for a winning opener, Alex.
I'm here because I think he can win.
I can get out of the way.
Well, that sounds vague and inadequate.
I want to know what's up with Terry Womack and the Black Caucus.
The president and Congressman Womack, they have a good relationship.
If we lose Womack and the Black Caucus, we're done on Monday.
You wanna be minority whip.
Only if I deserve to be.
Is there a spot for him on financial services?
Doug, stay where you are.
You find him and you get him here.
You have a statement?
You anticipate any other big WikiLeaks info dumps coming down the pike?
Every misstep is highlighted and heightened.
They wanna know what happened with their election.
Hey, who's Lisa Williams?
I don't.
I need five minutes with this.
Throwing the election back to the states, it gives us less certainty.
Yes, but the career politicians, they are more entrenched than ever.
There's a new House, with members you don't know.
I think we need to move the playing field back to the imaginations of the people.
Oh, you have that much faith in the voters in Tennessee and Ohio?
You should listen to the doctors some of the time, Francis.
- You're sure it's for real?
- Sure as I can be.
Okay, we'll be in touch.
Okay.
So call him back.
Making progress on a couple of Dems.
Think Congressman Alspaugh is about to turn.
Come on.
Thank you.
If you win them, you win Monday.
We should try.
You still have a few calls.
Mark, I was thinking, maybe we could, um... cancel tomorrow night in Philadelphia.
Darling, we haven't slept all week.
You're exhausted.
But you're not enjoying yourself.
Because he won't listen to me.
What difference does it make whether I'm enjoying myself or not?
Isn't that what this is all about?
You are in charge.
I shouldn't think out loud, that's all.
No, you're right.
Let's not talk about anything that happens outside of this room.
Contact Ambassador Caspi and buy me 15 more minutes.
Uh, please don't think of this as a deal with the Underwoods.
To be frank, they could be gone by Monday.
Congressman Watts.
Governor, we're so happy you could join us today.
As am I. The black community deserves so much better than Frank Underwood's failed policies.
I was told 9:00, and it's already been an hour.
I appreciate your patience.
I'm not gonna beg.
No, you're gonna smile.
The Muhammed Kalabi they arrested in Tennessee is not the Kalabi connected to ICO.
What else?
Billy got a byline on that three days ago.
Declaration of war?
Underwood was so evangelical, but hasn't mentioned it in weeks.
Lisa Williams.
What about Lisa Williams?
The next House vote is the day after tomorrow.
The natives are restless, outraged, just plain scared, actually.
They want to wake up in the America that they fell asleep in.
So, this is the James S. Brady press briefing room.
And this pool was really the only way for him to exercise.
It was, uh, an open secret that the president used a wheelchair most of the time.
Which is why the White House was one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings.
Right.
That office used to carry so much weight, so much, uh, respect.
You don't think it does anymore?
Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to hijack the tour.
Moving on...
Gentlemen, we're ready for you now.
I could come here today and talk about... federal sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, which obviously are racially motivated.
I'm sorry, but are you asserting that the crack epidemic is exclusive to the black community?
No, not at all.
But I think it's fair to say that sentencing discrepancies have disproportionately affected minority populations.
The whole point of today's meeting is to broaden our platform.
Republicans are always dwelling on crime, Governor.
Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.
You're not listening.
Look, I want to help you help yourselves.
So, does anyone else have any questions for the governor?
Well, I have a question.
What has Francis Underwood ever done for you?
This little charade this morning...
You may have genuine differences with me.
But see, that's the operative word, "genuine."
Can someone here please explain to me why you all are still so loyal to Francis Underwood and the Democrats?
One of these days the members of this room will realize how much you actually prop up the status quo.
And how's that working for ya?
Will, why don't we thank the gentlemen and women for their time?
You've made a mistake.
What we're proposing is a new election in the two states that weren't able to provide valid electors by the safe harbor date.
I'd like to know, where does the attorney general stand on this?
Looking into it, but on board.
Not if people believe the president is being chosen behind closed doors.
A process that is laid out in the Constitution.
The same process that can keep us gridlocked for the next two years.
The House should and will decide.
Delaware has one congressman.
How will that play in Austin when your opponent in two years tells voters that you allowed a state like Delaware to have the same influence as Texas?
A lot of you incumbents will be in danger of losing your seats.
And there it is.
That is the look of contemplating loss.
Loss... the only constituent that anyone in this room really listens to.
I, for one, would like to hear how the president feels about all this.
We believe in one person, one vote.
If we take that away, then what is this country?
- Isn't that right, Mr. President?
- Absolutely, Madam President.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
So the Lincoln...
- How'd it go?
- I might need you to save me.
- Sure... why not?
It was a complete waste of my time.
I do.
I should explain something to you, Governor.
- Are you threatening me?
- No, I'm enlightening you.
- Governor.
Hey, um, why don't you let me in for a second, just flip me the controls?
I wish I could, but, uh, you're not on the flight plan.
You know I'm gonna be the president, right?
- I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.
- I'm gonna be the president, and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.
I was just talking to the pilots.
Okay.
What the fuck are you gonna do?
Sit down and try and act like an adult... or at least like the next President of the United States.
Sit.
- Who are they?
- Maybe Indonesian secret police?
What if we don't pay?
Are there other buyers?
I don't know.
Obviously, this stays between us.
Say, "Thank you, Doug."
Thank you, Doug.
We met on a bus.
- Where was that?
So, then what?
Started spending every night together.
At some point, she told me about this guy who used to come around to check on her.
- What'd he look like?
- I never saw him.
Just sometimes she said he was coming, so she couldn't hang out.
She wouldn't really tell me anything about him.
Hey.
How are you doing?
Thanks.
There are no Russian troops in Antarctica.
We're willing to recommend changes to the Antarctic Treaty parties.
What happens to you when the Underwoods are ejected from office?
How long do you expect the world to believe those aren't your soldiers?
Do you like working for the Underwoods?
How loyal are you?
When the time comes, will you stand with them... or not?
I leave tomorrow.
News of the sanctions will hit Monday.
Let's meet before you go.
You're a career diplomat, a professional.
Maybe that's why I trust you.
You could tell that from across the street.
I never saw her from across the street, though.
Isn't that a funny thing to think about?
A lot of people, I think, they spot the one they love from across the street sometimes.
It's like they're running an errand, and they happen to spot the one they love across the street running a different errand.
There's this sudden thrill, like... while the person you love is inhabiting the same world as you.
I don't want you to burn yourself.
No burning, no.
Because of the ceremony.
"It should be a ceremony," it's what she said.
Well, even if it's gum, I still prefer to step outside to chew it.
Like lighting a delicious cigarette.
The things we miss, the rituals...
Excuse me.
Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.
I'm not a politician.
I can give orders, I can follow orders and I know when the hell to shut up.
And you're a steady hand, which, again, the country needs.
He's a difficult man to be around.
We'll get there.
You'll be called vice president, but you will be, de facto, something more.
What were you doing there?
I asked Seth Grayson about Lisa Williams.
Why the hell did you think that was an appropriate thing to do?
Didn't I tell you to drop this lead?
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie, and everything she said to me is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto, which has been picked apart by every message board and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.
You looked through my notes.
You're out.
- What?
- You're fired, Jeffries.
We need to make a deal that forces Claire Underwood to resign.
- And why does that matter?
Oh, I'm going to exile Claire Underwood to the Naval Observatory and stack her schedule with state funerals in Southeast Asia.
She'll never see the inside of the West Wing, let alone the Oval.
You need Brockhart by your side, supporting you.
I don't want to hear about Brockhart.
What matters is that Will becomes president.
Underwood in office can cause damage.
Whereas, if they lose, they're losers.
I want this election to be between me and Francis Underwood.
Now, if you expect a willing partner in the White House, you'd better let that bill get to the floor as is.
If you get to the Oval, Will, you're gonna need the Speaker more than she needs you.
So, I'm gonna call her back, and you are going to apologize.
Will, get back here!
Enough.
Shut the door.
You look like death.
I can't get in touch with the kidnappers.
It's been radio silence for almost 24 hours.
There's rumors they don't even have him anymore.
I can't keep this from the president any longer.
Okay.
And then I'll tell him what a big help you've been.
Sanctions hit in a couple of hours.
Deal with Secretary Durant or with some very unhappy billionaires.
What are you talking about?
Someone in your administration was willing to pay a great deal of money for his safe return.
Who do you think orchestrated that leak?
Nice to meet you.
Before we begin, I'd just like you to know that the president and the former president are on the line.
Mr. President.
It's best you come back to Washington.
Find anything yet?
Not yet.
Thank you again, Mr. Barnes, for letting me take a look.
I won't be long.
This is everything?
This is everything they sent from Zoe's apartment.
I mean, it's just papers, but...
Anyway, I'll leave you to it.
Okay.
What did you buy yourselves, another day?
Our backgrounds are different, but we're both hardscrabble boys at heart.
We need the last word, last blow, last move.
We can push the bill through the House for a new election for president in Tennessee and Ohio.
Speaker McCarthy won't let that happen.
But I could... convince her if you were to step down, and our full tickets president and vice president run against each other in Tennessee and Ohio.
We'll make the deal.
I think this is the right thing to do.
Tomorrow, I'll announce my intention to step down after the revote.
I'll let the Speaker know to put the bill on the floor.
We have one more outstanding piece of business, the Supreme Court nominee.
Well, she's liberal enough for you to swallow, and conservative enough when it counts.
We don't have time for Senate hearings.
I can make a recess happen.
I'll see you on the campaign trail.
Where does that leave me, huh, Alex?
I went out on a limb here.
If we don't have a vote in the House, then what?
Francis Underwood hasn't won a thing, okay?
Because you would've lost.
- The Conways are not the Walkers.
- It wasn't your decision to make.
Excuse me?
I agreed with Usher because he will sacrifice everything to get Brockhart into office, which makes Conway weak, ready to lose.
I thought you saw what I saw.
